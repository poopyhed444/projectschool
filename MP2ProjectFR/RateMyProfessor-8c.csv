5,This class is hard  but its a two-in-one gen-ed knockout  and the content is very stimulating. Unlike most classes  you have to actually participate to pass. Sections are easy and offer extra credit every week. Very funny dude. Not much more I can say.
5,Definitely going to choose Prof. Looney's class again! Interesting class and easy A. You can bring notes to exams so you don't need to remember a lot. Lots of bonus points available and the observatory sessions are awesome!
4,I overall enjoyed this class because the assignments were straightforward and interesting. I just didn't enjoy the video project because I felt like no one in my group cared enough to help.
5,Yes  it's possible to get an A but you'll definitely have to work for it. The content is pretty interesting  but you have tog get super organized in this class. You'll have multiple things due every week and a ton lectures to go over. If possible  I'd avoid this class as an 8 week course. You'll definitely always have somethingto do in this class.
5,Professor Looney has great knowledge in Astronomy  while he can explain them in a super easy way in an elementary class. He taught this class with great passion and great illustration. This class is definitely fun to take. If you are interested in further knowledge that this class won't cover  don't hesitate to ask him. Great teacher.
5,Looney is a super funny guy and this class was really interesting. It wasn't a complete blow off  but it wasn't too bad. Just do all the homework/observation sessions and study a bit the night before exams and you should pull an A. I would definitely recommend him for a science gen ed. There was no text book and no final.
4.5,He is one of the most enthusiastic and off the walls professors you'll ever meet. His grading is very fair. The exams aren't bad considering you can use a notes sheet. There's lots of Iclickers so you have to show up to class. There's no book used. Take this class its fun and interesting!
5,"""Sexy Boy"". Killer Skies was one of the best classes I've taken. Looney kept me excited for class and did presentations effectively and with great humor. Highly recommend him in general. Online quizzes were tough but given multiple chances. Exams are somewhat hard so study. Never a dry moment  great guy  great topics. You're gonna have fun. Ciao"
5,Excellent professor. Hilarious  fun  and good.
4,Loved his Killer Skies class! He's very funny and allows you to bring in a sheet of notes for each test and even the final! Theres no textbook  but you have to use his ppt slides alot for the HW and cheat sheets. The HW is quite hard tho  even with the ppt slides given to you. But you get unlimited number of tries  and the highest score is taken
4,A kind  knowledgeable  phenomenal teacher. I would recommend any of his classes. He is hilarious  engaging  and intelligent. This class was so far from my major  and yet I enjoyed class everyday. Study  its astronomy. But Looney is fantastic.
5,He is absolutely AMAZING! A complete riot and wonderful professor  Class is NEVER boring and something new is taught daily  Online homework is a breeze and tests aren't horrible  Studying is necessary for them though.
4.5,He is AMAZING! The funnest class I have had all semester. He's knows his material and is always willing to help.
5,Best professor I've had so far! He is informative  clear and funny. Makes you actually wanna go to class... Gotta do homework regularly and study for the test--they aren't bad if you do.
4.5,Great professor and great class! I recommend taking this course  it was a physical science and quantitive reasoning II course.
5,Dr. Wager is a great professor. Her expectations were clear and she really wants to help you succeed. She was always entertaining and knew what she was talking about. I took her hybrid course which i would definitely recommend.
5,I LOVE Prof. Wager. She's hilarious and dedicated. I took this as the hybrid block and I loved it. It is fast paced  but not a ton of work. The final is only a 5 page paper  and you can revise your essays as many times as you want. She really wants you to do well and helps you as much as you can. If I could take every class with her  I would.
5,Taken as Hybrid course. It was good taking it with this teacher. Especially in a hybrid course she only assigns stuff that is needed. Be aware if you take this in a hybrid class there will be something due EVERY time before the next class. Course work is easy if you are committed to it and turn it in on time. PEER reviews are not accepted late.
4,Good teacher  I took this as a second block class on accident. Lots of reading in the class  not super necessary for the lectures. But a fun teacher who's excited to share English with students  normal amount of homework assignments and a small 5 page paper due at finals. 8/10
2,Overall she is a fine professor but there are a lot of little things like not very clear assignments gradings are sometimes weird. Didn't do one peer review on time don't expect to get an A.
4,Wager is a great professor! She makes the class lively and is absolutely hilarious. I took the hybrid-block course. As long as you do the assignments on time it's an easy A. The only complaints I have are: a lot of the examples/ content is politically influenced (liberal) and she doesn't always describe assignments or what is expected of you well.
4.5,Jans does an excellent job of teaching the basics and technical aspects of cinema while putting a feminist/progressive spin on things. Great professor who cares that her class learn new perspectives from her lectures. She is a solid grader and gave great feedback whenever I asked for it. My writing skills have improved from taking this course!
5,Really enjoyed her class. Took it as a hybrid block class so it was very fast paced and all the assignments were submitted online. She was very clear about how she wanted you to write and was very willing to help. I would take her again  I was very impressed with her teaching style.
5,Jans is GREAT! She is a fantastic teacher and her class was both interesting and lively. She does expect you to read a lot out of the book  and other sources as well. She is a very lively teacher and you can tell she loves the subject she teaches!
5,She's one of my favorite teachers I've taken. I actually took her last semester but I liked her enough that I thought everyone should still know SHE'S AWESOME. She is clear on the work and you go over it in class. I would've taken her for 2010 as well if she offered it..
4,I found Professor Wager very helpful. She does have a specific way she wants you to write  but does make it clear after the first few assignments. She helped me with brevity  but wanted me to change my writing style to match the way she liked it. She was a decent professor  and is very willing to help.
3.5,I took into to cinema studies from her and loved it. Great teacher which allot of film experience. She will work with you to sharpen your writing skills. One of my favorite professors here on campus! Just be prepared to think outside the box about movies.
4,Trouble is  if you have different opinions on the topics you talk about then she won't like you. As long as you stick to what she lays out you should be good. She wants very badly to have students she molds  if she can't mold you she'll throw you away.
4.5,Jans is wonderful. Her teaching methods are some of the best that I have experienced. There is a good deal of time involved in the course  but if you like film criticism you won't mind. Though the subject ended up not being my cup of tea  I still enjoyed going to class and doing the assignments.
5,Jans is an excellent teacher! Just awesome. She is definitely organized. She wants class discussion  and that makes the class fun! You can correct your papers at the end of the semester in your portfolio to have a better grade. She is friendly and sincerly cares about student success. WORD OF CAUTION  MANDATORY ATTENDANCE AND DON'T EVER BE LATE.
4,I loved this class! Jans is very flexible and open-minded. She just wants to help students learn. Take her class!!
5,Jan is an amazing Professor  and I highly recommend taking her for English. Grades are easy to improve  as you can edit your writing assignments as much as you want to get a better grade.
5,She was an excellent teacher! Very organized. She encouraged class discussion  which made the class fun! Had several papers to do which helped you to improve writing skills. Could correct papers to have a better grade. She is also friendly and genuinely interested in student success. Awesome all around!
4,Writing in her class was fun. I really liked how she would let students rewrite their papers till they got the grade they wanted. It certainly kept my grade up!
5,Jans has the most effective teaching style of any teacher I've met. The material can be difficult  but she makes it very easy to do well. You have a series of papers to write  if you get a bad score on them she will let you rewrite them for a better score. You can continue rewriting them until you get the score you want.Well prepared  helpfull. A+
1.5,This guy is a quack! You never understand what he is saying!
2.5,Warden's mind is sort of like a lottery ball machine... every now and then a ball will come firing out with a small piece of information but never in a sequential order. Nice guy though.
2,he likes to talk about his cat and diareha.
1.5,Could I despise this man anymore? His lectures are one random topic after another. He is always late and never knows when the class is over... partially because he doesn't wear a watch. Lost every single one of my papers. Truly awful waste of time.
4.5,The lectures are sleep-inducing unless u participate  he gives lots of credit if u do. Study sheets for quizzes  so u know what 2 expect. Tests are do-able if u read the material. 8 page paper at the end  I'm so sick of doing PhilaU papers.
5,thinks too much  knows too much  but all in all hes a great person to work with. Though sometimes it looks like its painful for him to teach..all the sweat is a shame..
5,Wonderful teacher!! He is kind and knows his stuff. Take him if you can!
5,talks sooooooo much  zzzzz..where am i?  but very down to earth  fair grader if u do the work  participate in class  it REALLY REALLY helps ur grade  so do it!
3,I took his online class as an elective and regretted taking it by the end. The information is interesting but he is a tough grader. His tests were hard and very confusing.
3,He gives quizzes that are hard to understand . The midterm and the final are a joke. The questions are twisted in such a way to just confuse you. (which I think is his main goal). You will love the class and hate it at the end. Most of my classmates agreed with me on this. Good luck  you will need it!
4,Best professor I've had at UVU. If you show up  pay attention  participate  and read you'll learn a lot and get a good grade.
5,By far one of the best professors I've ever had. He doesn't give busy work and he consistently checks to make sure that you're understanding the materials. Great Professor  Highly recommend.
5,Bryan is Awesome! He knows his stuff. He knows how to teach for understanding and how to make all subjects interesting. He expects quite a lot but is always there to help. I came out learning a ton and loving the subject.
4.5,Really good professor  knows what he's talking about. Willing to work with you  Tests kinda hard and Expects a lot but makes it fun. If you pay attention you will do well in the class. Has you make a Language for this class as final project.
5,Great teacher and fun class. Two thumbs up and totally recommend this professor to others.
5,Take this class! Bryan is the man! Do the reading and the assignments and study for midterm and final and you'll be fine. 1st half is linguistics  which might be difficult for some  but he explains it well. Work on your language creation project throughout the semester. Great class! I loved class discussions and he includes everyone. Take it!
3,Before you take any of his classe you should have a masters in English. He cares more about your grammar than your content. He doesn't make very clear points  and he tests on things that he doesn't teach  and arent in the books. Nice man but perhaps not the best teacher.
5,"(Language & Culture)This class was great. Be patient through the linguistics and the culture part is awesome! Be warned: you will only get an ""A"" if you earn it completely. Read everything asked of you and do the workbook assignments. Brian's hilarious and extremely fair. Very fun class. Highly recommended."
5,Bryan is one of the best ASL and Deaf History teachers i have ever had! Pay attention and you can't go wrong.
4.5,He was my teacher for years. He knows alot about deaf culture  history and linguistics. I loved having him and it was a lot of fun. It was very educational for me. If it werent for him  then I wouldn't be able to know a lot of things because I am currente
5,He is very good. He likes to take the time to teach his students. He care's about how they do. If you don't understand something  he is willing to actually help you. Keeps class entertaining.
2,I am very disappointed in this class. I have decided against taking any asl classes because of this instructor. I have also changed my major because of this class.
5,Very knowledgeable about the topic. ASL clear and easy to read. Expects a lot from his students and makes you earn that A  but you come away from his classes with improved skill in ASL and more knowledge about topics relating to the Deaf. Highly recomended.
2.5,No Comments
5,Very interesting. Willing to help and respects people's oppinions. Very knowledgable about the subject.
4.5,Very good ASL/Deaf History teacher. Well informed  clear signs and fair instructor.
1,Took online course. Day after Midterms I was the *only* one who turned in the next assignment. Rest of the year was 3 people turning in their homework. Took off points for incorrect COMMENTS  not just incorrect code. hyper-specific. bad teacher. wouldnt even help me install the software properly  gave no link to online instructions either.
1,"This ""professor"" should not teach. He does not actually care about whether or not his students fail. He does not give instruction but rather is a grader. And when he does give feedback it's not productive  he just tells you what you did wrong. There is no helpful criticism. He is just out for an ego boost."
1,"He does not do a very good job of actually instructing. If you can't meet with him during his ""How to schedule ""face-to-face"" meeting"" hours then you're screwed as far as learning more. Good luck actually learning how to do anything from him."
1,He will give you a zero for even the smallest of errors. Does not answer questions or help  just tells you to read the book. His grading system is completely outrageous  and the class is more about following his ever growing set of rules than learning to code. Not at all what I expected from an introductory coding class.
1,"Although this ""professor"" sticks to his syllabus when grading  his system is outrageous. I was deducted 22 points from the first assignment  (out of 20 points possible idk how that makes sense) 10 of which was for a single incorrect output when my other six were correct. Gives no credit for correct lines of code  only deducts for wrong ones."
1,He doesn't answer questions  and won't meet with students unless you submit your questions to him first. Over 60% of the class has dropped out. He has insulted students  and doesn't grade fairly. I told him I was having trouble on quizzes. He told me to read the book. He is an embarrassment for DMACC. Don't take his class.
1,His syllabus/announcements use 5 different fonts and is just a list of all of the things you aren't allowed to do. This class isn't about learning to code  it's about remembering his rules. Don't bother asking him for help. He won't answer questions. If you follow his rules on how to ask questions  he will respond  but he will not help you.
1,Missed the first assignment because I was moving. Did every assignment thereafter and he had me dropped at midterms for not attending. Does not give clear instructions and he doesn't seem to care at all about the students. I get the impression he is one of those people that is miserable and wants everyone else to be miserable as well.
1,"This ""professor"" has no concept of how to teach a class. I should have read the warning signs. He waits until the refund date for classes to actually assign homework  his list of specifications took a full minute just to scroll through. He double deducts points because he lists them in different ways. DO NOT TAKE. He enjoys taking points off."
1,Horrible gives no help to students and expects unrealistic levels of perfection on homework
1,I should have listened to the reviews on here! Avoid this instructor at all cost!! I started the class  did my first assignment  got 4 out of 5 correct  and received a 50% grade! Unrealistic expectations from this instructor! Dropped this class after the first quiz to get a refund.
1,"This ""teacher"" will not inspire you to be a better programmer. He takes pride in deducting as many points as possible. Do you want to get 50% on an assignment because you forgot to comment the chapter/assignment number and didn't use 100% correct naming conventions even though your program runs flawlessly?Then this professor is for you."
1,Should've listened to everyone on here. Not sure how this guy still has a job. Unreal requirements that would not apply in the real world. All based on what HE wants to see  not what is logical. Even if you're work is correct  it has to be done in his ridiculously specific manner in order  and you will STILL lose points. Avoid at all costs!
1,Both books outdated  one by 9 years. He did not explain his way on how to turn in assignments properly. Explanation for everything is repetition of syllabus and reread. 4 open days is required to meet. He insulted students and scares students from giving instruction on discussion board. The download is provided to him.
1,Horrible Instructor! Wish I had looked him up before taking his class. Change to another instructor immediately. Deducts points like it's going out of style. Fully functioning solutions with documentation deducted points for unclear technicalities.
1,"Hands down WORST ""teacher"" ever. DROP NOW!! He is not helpful and takes joy in handing out 0's. Consider yourself warned..."
1.5,Drop this class immediately. Absolutely will not teach anything that is not needed for the assignments. Flat out said he wouldn't answer my question about something in the textbook because we wouldn't need it for any assignments. You are better off buying the book and using stackoverflow for your questions.
1,"Easily the worst teacher I've ever had. His idea of teaching was ""Just read the book."" He would look for any excuse to give 0's on assignments. I got one on the 1st assignment of the semester  not because it was late  but because I sent it as attachment in email instead using Blackboard. It seemed to me like he was only there to collect a paycheck."
1.5,Warning: By far the worst online teacher no communication skills  no desire to help
1.5,Showed his assignments and emails to IT personnel I work with and was adivsed that his class wouldn't be of use in the real world.
4,Knows alot  the class is long and boring but she gives good notes.
5,Originally didn't enjoy this woman  however  she is unfortunately stuck with teaching the worst subject of all time..I like her alot as a person  she IS very dry and not interested in what she's teaching  but who could blame her? give her a shot- she's ok :)
4,Knows her**** but is really hard. Unfair grader and tests are horrible.
3.5,One word. DRY.
5,Great Teacher  learned a lot from her class. She is very helpful and is willing to meet with you after class if you are having trouble. Though shes a very hard grader  she is reasonable. Take her class only if you are willing to learn and work.
2.5,Very tough...not funny. But I learned Alot! Overall not bad.
4.5,Very helpful  and she knows her stuff. She is willing to help you with any questions you may have.
1.5,boring as dirt
1,Horrible professor  graded unfairly  will give you the same grade for projects based off your first project grade... bias toward girls.. terrible experience with her for building tech...
3,Talks like the Shabby Sheak lady on HGTV  OHMYGOD  informative  helpful  funny in dry way  but there were *NO* HANDOUTS  SHE AND CHARLIE READ FROM A FREAKING NOVEL THAT THEY EXPECTED US TO WRITE DOWN  'scuse me  but I'VE GOT CARPEL TUNNEL! P'd me off!
5,Great professor to take  very professional.
4.5,This was probably one of my favorite studios. Lauren was very helpful and professional as well as working out details.
2.5,Don't get sick during semester. u'll get no sympathy. Needs nu wardrobe  safari attire--good thing she designs arch not clothing. Bases grades on pers opinion  not ur work. Best wishes if u get stuck w/ her.
4.5,I loved the course I took with Beverly. I definitely got some practical information I could actually use.
5,Beverly was extremely helpful and had a lot of practical advice. I will actually use what I learned in her class  which certainly isn't the case with all RTC courses.
1,Nice lady but clueless. Announcing that she was single and available didn't help. Begged for us to give her fives....I thought that was inappropriate.
2,I have taken 8 RTC courses and she was the worse instructor. She was late to class and did not pay attention during class presentations. We went to the a pool one day. What a waste of time and money.
4.5,Professor Faunce is a very fair teacher. If you do your work  you'll get an A. Some of her activities may seem very elementary ed  but that's the program  not her!
1,Having just completed my 13th RTC course  she is by far the worst instructor I've had. I would never take another course with her.
4,She's kind of funny  some of the activities make you feel like you're in elementary school.
4,Pluss is hysterical and made COMM Research Methods bearable. There are no surprises here and the final is just the four quizzes she gave throughout the semester. Of those four  she drops the lowest one. There were 5 assignments  5 quizzes (including the final). The material can be dry but that's not on her. she made a boring class fun  take her.
3,"Prof. Pluss is sweet and upbeat. Her ""quizzes"" are about 40 questions. However she does drop the lowest of the 4. There is a group project and a final project. Easy A if you study for the quizzes."
2,I took her for research methods and had to drop her class half way. Nice lady but VERYYYYY tough grader and gives you an F even if you do the work. (I had 5 Fs even though i did my work and gave everything on time) Usually gives 12 assignments and the final Research project. The lectures are pretty long. Overall i do not reccomend.
1.5,Professor Pluss grades assignments very harshly  even when you put effort into them. Not clear when explaining material and class is very boring.
4,I believe she has changed her teaching style since these last comments. She's very into the class   but its just too much for a 110 course. Had to curve the mid-term and final because the averages were 70s. She would be great for a higher level course  but you can definitely take an easier professor for this class.
5,GREAT PROFESSOR! I love this class. She sso helpful and teaches in an interesting way. The test and quiz was challenging but it was all good! Study cause you will need to know your stuff! VEry fun class.
5,She is a best professor. We had 2 project  and 2 exam. I passed her class with a  A or B. I am not sure. However  she is helpful. If you need a good grade and want to take the course  I say take her class. She is helpful  and a great professor. Trust me.
5,She's a great professor who give a fantastic introduction to the university. If you have a chance to take her  go for it!
5,Super nice lady and the class is super easy
4.5,"The easiest ""A"" I ever got. Easiest grader @ WPU. You're told what's going to be on the exams and speeches are graded more on effort and organization. Don't worry  you don't have to give a Powel or Obama-like delivery."
5,I love this professor!!!!! She is awesome. Definitly take her.
5,Excellent Professor and loves what she is teaching. She is very nice and willing to help. Take her if you can! Very pleasant working environment and very down to earth.
5,easy A.short homework assignments due weeekly and easy midterm and final.
5,She is a very fair prof.The material is easy and she makes it interesting.No midterm just weekly hw assignments  a speech  & a few papers.I had a lot of fun in the class and I think she's a great instructor. Very sweet!
3,Very nice woman  but really isnt the teaching type. In a semester  we learned maybe...10 things total which she kept repeating OVER AND OVER AND OVER again...she's pretty easy though  final  midterm  speech and a paper.
3,Shes nice and occasionally has fun in-class assignments but most of the time its just boring common sense material. Tests are essays and study guides are very broad. Not much to evaluate your grade.
4,No Comments
4,She grades on the Final  Midterm  1 short paper  1 5 min speech  and attendance. The paper & speech are easy but the tests are tough. She gives study guides but they cover a lot of material. Answers Emails very quickly.
4.5,She is very easy but you have to show up to classes because she covers the material on the test in class.
4.5,Pros Pluss is very nice  she tries to make class fun. Her grading is fair and if you take her notes you are sure to pass her tests. She only assigns about 1 report on a movie and 1 oral report  shes pretty easygoing and class was not hard at all.
5,No Comment
5,Great person and teacher - easy style and fun to have class with.
4.5,Very nice and smart. She asked us to do a few extra papers beyond RTC requirements.
4.5,She's cool. sometime laughs upsettingly loud but that's not from an evil intention. she enjoys teaching. class is about critical writing and provides fun discussion time. it goes in appropriate pace so it's easy to keep up. hw amount is moderate.
5,she is a very nice teacher. she is really clear on what she wants us to accomplish. tries and helps students understand as much as possible. grades fair  but a little hard. do the homework  a few essays from the readings but she will walk you through it
1,No Comments
5,In addition to those two smiling faces below  she is fair! You'll do your HW and you'll be fine! She is encouraging  motivating  consistent  practical and understanding. She prepares you well for final so you can not fail!No tricks! There should be more teachers like her in SDSU!! It is a journey that you don't regret while in school and after.
5,She is one of the best professors I've ever had - she really cares about her students and their learning experience. She actually TEACHES. I learned so much from her. The only people who have any problems are the lazy ones that never go to class. Plus she's really cute. :)
4.5,Mary is a very cute lady(funny clothes!)...she gives examples of A papers  makes you write pre-paragraphs and discusses what is good and bad in them before the essays are due(very clear)  only 3 quizzes(easy). I got an A(97) and adored her  class was only boring if you didn't add to the conversation.
1,I did not know there is a teacher in this world that is lazy as she is. She dismisses the class very early so if some student did not undrestand thay have to learn themselves at home. But if you are lazy as she is and do not want to learn anything you may take her class. Do not worry she either gives you a grade to pass or not
2.5,she isnt as hot as everyone is saying and her class is usually boring... she drops your grade for bad attendence... essays and assignments are easy enough though
3,shes too damn liberal. i think shes a communist. she tries to politicize english. thats not the way it should be.
2.5,one word---BORING...sooo boring... her lectures are unorganized.
5,Great teacher. Very helpful and understanding.
2,She is not all that..lectures are BORING    takes atendance and lower you score for missing class. not helpful...
5,I never thought I would like a writing class. She is very nice and helpfull. Good looking also.
5,She's an awesome professor! I never thought I will enjoy writing til I had her as my professor!
5,She is a very nice/beautiful/kind/helpful teacher! If you are motivated for learning  definitly you can make it! But  please show up and hand in assignment on time:(very important)
5,"""Grammar and language made easy"" should be the tittle of her class. Excellent professor!"
5,Great teacher  hot. Very helpful.
3,Doesn't really teach the class. She just breaks us down into small groups and we have to read and do group discussions every class. Not much homework. Gives you study guides for the exam but doesnt really review. Overall dont take her if you dont like group discussions and if you can't teach yourself.
3,Lots of reading  does give a review sheet but exams are not easy if you don't read the chapters..you have to spread to groups every class and discuss the readings..if you hate reading or group discussions don't take her class!!
5,I had Prof Francese a few semesters back. I called on her for a letter of ref and she was all about it. She was as helpful later as she was in class. Do the reading do the work and you'll be fine. She is very open minded and likeable
2.5,I think that the women studies class would have been more interesting if I took another teacher. Francese seems like a nice person  and her heart is in the right place  but I just don't think she is teacher material. He class is boring  I dreaded going. Sorry Ms. Francese but its the truth!
2.5,Tests: extremely difficult  unless you actually memorize each of the 80 definitions she hands out for you to look up. The tests also have little to do with class discussions. Homework: read 100 pages a week. Her attitude: standoffish  does NOT understand this is a gen. ed. i'm a studio art major  which means more time consuming work than most oth
2.5,UGH! Ridiculous! Francese is a nece person and seems to have a good heart  but does have an attitude problem. Her class is very boring  it could be an interesting class but she makes it BORING!
1,The reading is absolutely ridiculuos. The chapters are 80 or more pages long that needs to be read for the next week discussion. The book is so boring  things that you absolutly would not have interest. She says that she can't judge us based on our opinions but she does during discussion. don't take her.
4,This was the easiest of all the classes i took this semester if you take her at night she lets you out early you get no break either way pretty much gives you the answers to the test and there is a opinion paper  class is all discussion with 1 video and she trys to get guest speakers there is a short oral presentation on a reading of your choice.
2.5,Didn't really like her or the class. The whole semester you'll think you're doing good and then when your final grade is a D don't be surprised. If you would like to read and MEMORIZE and entire book (her exams are all fill in the blank) then take this class.
3,Her tests were imposible. The reading is rediculous. You have to memorize stuff that ultimatly means nothing.
4,A LOT of reading. A lot of memorization for the tests  which are tough even if you read. Classtime is pretty much all discussion. Do all the readings  and study for the tests  and you'll do okay. Not a class I looked forward to  though.
4.5,Very knowledged professor who knows what she's talking about and does not try to push her own opinions on topics raised in class onto her students. The class is very interesting and she will open your eyes to a new world.
5,She is awesome. I wish i needed to take more classes because I would definitly find something she was teaching. She is very easy and laid back. She really knows what she is talking about because she works in the field with abused women.
5,very good teacher.. wouldnt mind taking her for another class.. very fair with the work given! :0)
4.5,class was intereseting...the whole class was involved....She was very nice....cancelled class a few times...i would take her again for another class...
4.5,She was very nice...the assignments were clear....very easy going...i enjoyed going to her class...she kept the class involved
2,She gives a LOT of reading!! All we did in class was read a reading from the book as a group and then discuss it  preety easy! her tests are easy if you read the book. She was absent about 4 times  (which was good for us).overall.i dont regret taking her
4.5,Dr. White is one of the best professors I have ever had. She truly loves students and what she teaches. She is like a mother in the classroom. She is also really funny. She gives pop quizzes a lot and there is assigned reading.
5,Great teacher  knows what she is talking about. Super nice and funny  explains things clearly.
5,She is the best professor I ever had in my life! Great personality and very knowledgeable! Very respectful  professional and helpful. Even if you were not perfect but were working hard she will give you great grade! She is my favorite professor and absolutely recommend her class!!!
5,She is the best professor I ever had in my life! Great personality and very knowledgeable! Respectful to students and very helpful. Even if you were not perfect but were working hard she will give you great grade! I love her so much!!!!
3.5,Dr. White has a very outspoken personality. If she sees you sleeping or daydreaming  she will call you out. However  she is an amazing teacher. Truly knows what she is talking about and really wants you to actually learn. If you enjoy PR  take her. I would recommend her to everyone.
1,You absolutely have to read every night because she has pop quizzes so randomly. Sometimes once or twice a week and they are very technical questions that aren't multiple choice. and she doesn't drop it at the end when she drops your lowest quiz grade. We also has a paper that she changed to being worth 20 percent of our grade AFTER turning it in.
1,By far the most condescending  mean  disrespectful  and downright rude professor ever. Of all the classes I have taken in my college career  this was the absolute worst. Very unclear instructions not to mention ridiculous amounts of outdated readings required. Do yourself a favor and do not take any classes by her. You will regret it.
5,Loved her. She is a bit crazy - but in a good way. She genuinely wants her students to have a good grasp on the material. If she is teaching any other upper level PR classes while I'm at UT  I will definitely sign up for them! Attendance isn't mandatory  but encouraged - she gives in-classes quizzes pretty often & they're worth a lot of your grade.
2,She really contradicts herself. You have to read the book before she teaches you or else you will get confused. She rambles about her study abroad trip a good 20% of most classes.
5,Dr. White is by far the best teacher I've had at UT. If you come to class and pay attention  she will be incredibly helpful  especially in office hours. She gives pop quizzes but also gives at least 3 opportunities to replace a bad quiz grade if you come to class. Overall  she's helpful  to the point  and knows her stuff. Take this class for sure
4,Good instructor. Don't skip class-she gives frequent pop quizes. Read the text  ask questions  and take good notes. Tests are multiple choice.
4,She is a very good teacher. She loves the subject. She has a quiz every week but it's like one question and writing your name's already 50% of the quiz! It's boosts up my grade for sure. The exams are pretty easy but I still fail them  lol. Still gives you credit for speaking up in class and she likes it if you sit in the first 5 rows.
5,Dr. White is a fantastic instructor. She is very passionate about PR and gets the class involved so that you aren't falling asleep. She offers daily quizzes to check attendance and to help boost your grade! She is absolutely wonderful and someone I admire greatly.
4,"Dr. White is scary and can be rude. She knows what she is talking about but intimidated me to death! Wants people to ""join in the discussion"" and will call you out in front of the class if you made a mistake. I did learn a lot but would have rather had a different professor. If you have to take her you will be fine. I got a B+ for the course."
5,Dr. White is an incredible professor. Two years into my PR career  I still quote things she said in my class. She's tough but fair. Despite it's appearance  PR is very difficult field. Her class is a good test on whether you'll succeed. Sit in the front  join PRSSA and do all the readings. If you don't enjoy this class  don't major in PR!
1,she is horrible...talks to students like the are in fifth grade. take dr. shaw
4.5,Be vocal and participate. If she can tell you're daydreaming you're screwed. Very intelligent woman and knows her stuff. She remembers just about all of her students which I think is a good sign. I really liked her  one of my fave profs. She was my advisor too and helped me a lot.
4,I liked her and she still remembers me. I would suggest sitting in the front row or at least be vocal during discussions. That's the best way to get a long with her.
4,She does favor those who are vocal in class and demonstrate comprehension of the material  so sit near the front and speak out. I got a B+ in the class and cracked the book maybe twice. Just look out for the squeeks.
2,The worst teacher I ever had. So negative about everything  not understanding  and just plain unfair to people she doesn't favor. HIGHLY RECCOMEND TAKING THIS COURSE FROM DR.SHAW
3,The most time consuming class I've ever taken. She is a tough grader but very detailed in her feedback. Online class had 7 total papers and endless online discussions. I asked her a question about one of the papers and she was VERY rude about it. I'll admit I didn't read the entire assignment but still  she could've been nicer about it.
5,This class will kick your butt! With that being said  you will become a better student because of it. Instructor is very very knowledgeable and has fantastic real life stories to share. This class requires a lot out of you  tests are far from easy and the countless papers and online classroom discussions will require a lot of time and committmen
4,I liked her  her instructions were detailed and it was easy to do an assignment then look at the list and check them off. She wrote up her own material which was easily printed off from canvas and her video lectures could be listened to on mobile app. Topics changed every 2 wks but I promise  you will learn so much. Do all extra credit.
4,If you have a lot of classes  and/or work  I do not recommend this class. She is a great teacher  opinionated but thoughtful. Papers due every two weeks  one semester paper  and participation in online threads mandatory (min of two posts  then at least two more as more people joined.) STUDY for the quizzes/tests.
5,This class is definitely a challenge but one that I enjoyed. She does assign alot of work but gives plenty of time to turn them in. Some say that she's opinionated but I'd like to think of her as a free thinker that's aware of the problem with society. She wants students to think  and i can appreciate that. Study Study. I pulled off an 87
5,Good teacher.
4.5,Writing notes important to pass She takes notebooks for a grade. Will not let you use laptop in class Txtbk only available online (McGraw-Hill) Complete Learnsmart sections on McGraw-Hill almost every week for hmwk Online quiz every week (15 min. for 20 questions) Nice & helpful. Some classmates are offended when she has to cover religion/Puritans.
2,Extremely opinionated and grades papers based off the opinions stated. I.e. if you disagree with what she says in lecture your grade will be poor. Worst professor I've ever had.
4.5,-take notes (for a grade) -read assigned chapters & HW -test are over lecture & readings -EXTRA CREDIT & DOES NOT LET YOU FAIL -AMAZING at help -a semester research paper  ( 5 pgs.) BUT if you ask her for help  visit  her office  & see's you're working
4,Professor Ledbetter may seem a little all over the place  okay she really is all over the place. READ THE TEXTBOOK there's a test every couple of weeks  a lecture and reading. She's there for help all you have to do is ASK!! She has plenty of material to help you with your topics for her research paper  I really enjoyed her class.
1,7 papers for a short summer term!!! please do yourself a favor and DON'T take her class. Tough grader. endless homework.
5,AMAZING!!!! I learned so much from Prof. Ledbetter and the course is very eye opening! Loved and would definitely take again
4.5,Pat Ledbetter is extremely knowledgeable and certainly knows this subject inside and out. She is very involved with the online students  as she would email me right back if ever I had any issues or questions. She interacts with the class in the discussion forums  as well. I must tell you  however  that you DO need to DO THE WORK. She likes to assign writing papers and her tests can be challenging  but if you aim to learn and do the work YOU WILL LEARN! She is very good at what she does  but she is pretty tough.
1,Do yourself a favor and do not take this class. The papers that you will be directed to write will come with vague instructions. When you follow the instructions  guess what  the rules change and you are penalized. Unfair grading  vague descriptions  topic jumping (also vague)  you do not know how she arrives at your grade  because its made up.
3,LOTS of homework. 6 unit papers plus term paper  unit quizzes  reading and rating other student's work  and mandatory active participation on discussion boards. NOT EASY to work into a busy schedule as you had to more or less log in and participate DAILY. No text book  but 45-70 minute video lectures each unit.
3,Class is INTENSE! Omg I had to work my butt off for an A. Lots of papers to write & her directions aren't very clear. Bunch of discussion board posts to make to. If you think this is a blow off class think again. You have to put in ALOT of work for this teacher. I managed to barely streak by with an A. I would've been happy with a C in this class.
5,Her course is fairly intense  so if you aren't willing to do a research paper or read your textbook you're going to have a bad time. The lecture tests were easy if you pay attention (I did)  and the reading tests were easy if you read (I didn't). If you write a good paper  take good notes  and read the book you should be fine.
3,This class is NOT easy. You have to work your butt off to get an A. There are so many papers to write and she grades them pretty tough. Her directions aren't very clear either. You also have alot of discussion board posts to make. You have to put in alot of work for this teacher. As long as you do all the work on time you will pass.
2.5,Took this class online and there is much work involved each week  many discussion boards requiring active participation. There were 7 research papers with confusing instructions although you could write about almost anything. This class is not an easy A but possible if you put the work in.
1.5,Do not take if looking for an easy A. She makes you work for it and I still even made a B doing all I could. She is passionate about human rights and I liked reading her writings about it  but that's the only thing I liked. She is really bad about being clear about directions and waits till the last second to point out an issue with your work.
5,Professor Campos is the sweetest  most easy professor I've had. I was nervous to take Spanish since I hadn't since HS. She makes the content easy  and really works with you if you miss anything but make sure to tell her ahead of time. Quizzes and exams are pretty easy as well. I would love to take her for Spanish II if she ever teaches it again.
5,Prof. Campos is really nice. She will work with you if you miss class. Office hours and communicating with her helps. You need to pay attention and not skip class. Exams and papers are not to be taken lightly. I learned a lot from her. Whoever complains about her class is just lazy.
2.5,Not fully comprehend half of the time what she is saying. If you have not taken Spanish before or during high school  do not take her. She did not explain the materials really well. Her tests are easy if you know Spanish. 4 tests  drops 1.
2.5,Meh. She was alright. I'd take her again for an easy A. But if you worry about your grades throughout out the semester and want to physically see them on blackboard she's not the teacher for you because she always takes forever to post grades.
1.5,She assigns a lot of work but fails to tell you when it is due. Very unorganized. You can pretty much teach yourself the class as all she does is read the packets she gives you. Quizzes every week  and usually behind schedule. Doesn't communicate good with students. Take someone else if you can.
1,Do NOT take this teacher if you want to learn spanish. She is extremely hard to understand and is horrible at teaching concepts. I barely made a B because I took spanish in high school i was just rusty. Also she is extremely boring and monotoned. I do not recommend her
2,Professora Campos is nice and means well  but she is pretty hard to follow. She expects you to learn at a very fast pace  but doesn't engage her students or encourage questions. I had to rely heavily on the book. And the Web Sam is ridiculous. She's not a complete nightmare  but take someone else if you've never spoken a lick of Spanish before.
4.5,She is a great professor. Very kind hearted  lenient  and understanding. Her class was all in Spanish. The thing I appreciate more than anything is she grades by the level you're at in Spanish  not by letter grades per say. If you are not as advanced as others  she grades you at where you are. She is sooo helpful. Do the packets and the board work.
2.5,She is a really great professor! Kind of hard to understand but it is very easy to get an A. She takes up a lot of completion grades and some of the auditory quizzes  she gives you the script before hand. It is very hard to not do well.
4,This class was extremely easy. She's is a great professor. Attendance is mandatory  and she has worksheets that she takes up every week. On the worksheets she'll let you do corrections  so it's hard to get anything but a 100. She drops your lowest grades from every section  so this is an easy A.
4,Professor Campos is a good professor. Make sure to complete the assignments and keep them after she returns them because you will need them in the future for your writing journal grade. Tests are pretty easy if you come to class. Sometimes takes attendance for extra credit at the end of the year. I enjoyed this class and did learn something.
4,Ms. Campos is a nice person  Scattered sometimes. She does take roll and has an online lab that has about 35 assignmets per every two weeks  but most lang. classes will. She's understanding and VERY lenient. She doesn't speak amazing english  but she is understandable. If you're naturally good @ spn I recommend  if not you'll need to work a little.
2,There is no textbook  she passes out sheets or just reads a sheet out to you everyday  not too much reading aloud. She seems unorganized and teaches to students who already know spanish well  if you don't she tells you to go study on your time. I learned more spanish in high school.
3,Ms Campos is nice and does the best she can with teaching  however she is highly scatterbrained and changed the course work dates without notifying the class. Her tests are medium-hard and web sam takes forever
3.5,Personally I think she makes the class too easy. If you don't know Spanish or care to learn- don't waste her time (she's already pointed that out to some students)
1.5,A very nice lady  but difficult to understand and unclear about expectations. Our syllabus/calendar was useless and there is NO class participation required (something mandatory if you actually want to learn). Let's people misbehave like children. You can definitely phone-in this class but just try to be clear about the due dates because she isn't.
5,shes a great teacher  shes very helpful and maker sure you understand the material. I would take another class with her again.
2.5,She's a genuinely nice person. She helps you bump up your grade as much as she can. Go to class - she takes attendance. Do the WebSAM homework assignments just to get them out of the way early. Otherwise  you'll be spending 2 hours online on it. I recommend her! :)
4.5,I really enjoyed this class. She is so helpful and understanding. If you attend class  you'll get an A. It's so difficult to do poorly. The cultural things she teaches are so great and fun to learn. I'd take her again.
4.5,"I took Spanish 1 like 4 years ago. I'm glad I chose to take Prof. Campos. She is so sweet and helpful  and tries to make everything as simple as possible. She consistently says ""this is too hard"" about examples in the book and simplifies them so the class can understand. I will probably get a B in this class  and 4 years ago I made a D in SPN 1"
4.5,This is a remedial course for students who didn't score well on the ACT. Easy class. If you miss five times you automatically fail the course. All assignments are online  and it's up to you to complete them. If you don't miss any classes but fail the master exam you still pass the class. You don't get a credit but it goes on your transcript
3.5,good teacher
2,Sweet lady  she should have been a writer. Not a good teacher  I didn't learn anything at all. Very easy  but very repitative and mundane work. Boring class.
4.5,She is the most boring teacher i never had before....oh!~~~my GOD!~
1.5,Ixe2x80x99ve take a many of ESL classes before  what I think of Ann she is the most boring English teacher that I took a lesson with . The class is easy but she makes it difficult for the students and she take it very seriously that made you unconfident  and she did courage you or motivate you if did a good job. so my recommendation if wish to get A donxe2x80x99t
5,She is good. Take her.
2.5,Eh. she's not bad I am glad I had intead of Ms. Whitaker.
4.5,shes boring and comments on the same thing over and over  like you didn't hear it the first 15 times...
1,she is not very hot at all and she likes black boots
5,This is the easiest class! Ms. Lewald really cares about her students. She is always willing to help if you need it. Take her if you can.
4.5,She is very kind and helps a lot. take her and you will learn a lot. Even after this course she helps you on your papers. She is the best.
5,Ann Lewald is a great teacher and friend. She has always made time to assist her students when ever they needed help. I can only say I wish that they were more teachers at Tech like her. God Bless You!
5,She is the best. not so easy not so hard. give a lot of respect. she is veryyyyyyy kind. I loved her. take her. you will learn a lot
5,The class was a very good class  and the instruction was very good. Mrs LaWald cares about her students and wants the best for you. all you have to to is be respectful. She is very kind and will help in any way she can. She is old style elegant
3.5,SHOW HER SOME RESPECT  DO YOUR BEST  AND YOU WILL PASS THIS CLASS WITH EASE.

4.5,She is a very easy teacher. The class maybe boring but very imformative. She knows how to teach writing. She is also very understanding if you miss a class. Just don't interupt her class with a cell phone!!!
5,She is pretty hip for her age  and is quite informative and is easy to get along with and it is an easy class to pass
4.5,She a little droopy. But she is fun if you give her a chance. Very Intelligent!!
1.5,She is old and talks very monotone. Not easy on the eyes at all. No peronality and she sucks. She tells u at the start that u are not going to pass. Good Luck!
5,Dr. Hon is an amazing human being. She is someone you would want in your life even as a friend! PR Research with her was great. Super helpful  willing to work with you and she was extremely understanding. I wish she taught another course to take her again.
4.5,"Excellent course  though would have preferred if it hadn't been combined with ADV6006. Her enthusiasm is contagious! Sometimes too much powerpoint  but she is an awesome professor overall. I learned a lot and earned an ""A."" She is very clear about her expectations. Follow her guidelines and you'll be just fine."
4.5,Very enthusiastic and helpful. Her high energy level is sometimes exhausting.
5,No Comments
4,I liked Ruben and what I learned from him. You just have to learn how to listen to him.
1,it would be my luck to have him tons of times. The worst teacher ever... it would be nice if he knew anything... except architecture... could you be more irrelevant?
1,I believe that he may be a great architect but as a teacher  it needs a lot of work  because I had trouble in that class.
2,No Comments
3,ruben still hasnt fixed that dent in his lexus
4,This teacher know alot but doesn't really know how to teach it. He is a fun teacher but think about it 1st before taking his class.
4.5,Ruben likes to talk. A lot. But thats ok as long as you're interested in the History Of Design And Architecture. Overall I'd say he's cool.

5,Mrs. Mitchell is definitely the best teacher I ever had. She is caring  motivational  and wants you to succeed. She is brilliant and gives amazing lectures. She can be a tough grader but clearly states what she is looking for. Be sure to participate in discussions  she loves that. MAM will not only teach you theatre  she will teach you life lessons
5,MAM is inspirational! This class was fun and thorough  helping me learn about each play we analyzed. She never says your answer is wrong  but helps steer you into the right direction. I would LOVE to take this class again!
4.5,MAM is the bomb! She's a tough grader  but an extremely brilliant woman. You can learn so much if you listen and are involved in class. Do your work  show up to class  buy the book  study for exams/quizzes  and enjoy the classes she teaches!
5,She great! I love her. She tough yet hepfull!!!!
5,i really learnes tons from her even though she might think otherwise  but it was in her classes that I learned what I remember most about college  one of the most talented person i've met.
5,Margaret is great. She's so engaging and has so much to teach. She expects a lot  so only take her if you are prepared to work. Working for her is very rewarding  you'll learn so much.
5,She made it easy to give speeches in class. Loved how she made us do warmups on speech day.
5,She's freaking awesome!! She's super enthusiastic  so there's never a dull moment. She seems to really care about her students. I really enjoy her class and would recommend her to anyone.
5,Very sweet lady. She is caring and wants to help you. The class itself is fun. Only thing I would change is to not have pop quizzes  but its college  so that's kind of silly.
5,Awesome professor who cares about her students  she understands that everyone isn't comfortable speaking in front of people. Very tough grader though  only class i couldn't get an A in. Be prepared to work!!
1,She isn't a fair grader. She's offends her students. Honestly  there are way better professors to take rather than her. Maybe outside of class sea better  but probably not. She divorced and angry it seems like.
5,I had Reid for S121 and freshman seminar. Reid was a very understanding and amazing professor. She knew that people got jitters speaking in front of crowds and wouldn't penalize you for it. She could tell who put work into their speech and she would grade accordingly. Always asked questions about your topic and was interested. Great Professor.
5,She is great! Very helpful and so enthusiastic about her job. She made the class very fun to be in! Has quizzes about what you talked about in the class the day before  has great study guides as well.
5,She is one of the best professors on campus. For someone who did NOT want to take a speech class/ interpersonal communication class  she is very understanding of that. The goal is not to embarrass you or call you out but to really help you learn. I would def recommend to anyone. Also  I took her class before and she still remembers me on campus!
5,Amazing professor! While attendance is not mandatory  there is usually an assignment of some sort(hw  quiz etc.) that is due every class that can not be made up. Very fair. Be prepared to earn your grade.
3.5,Is a good teacher but when it comes to speechs she is a tough grader. Everything has to be perfect for you to get an A. If you are looking for an easy A don't take this professor
4,Professor Reid is a very nice lady. You do have to study  but it doesn't take too much effort. Her class was interesting and can help with day to day life. I enjoyed her class. She is funny.
5,Lots of reading in the book. Tests were fairly easy. Professor Reid is amazing! She made the class fun and enjoyable! We got to choose our own topics and the selections were great. There is some work to do and turn in for speeches  planning reports and preparation outlines  but they're easy once you know what you're going to talk about.
4.5,Great teacher. She really explains the materials well. As long as you attend her class and pay attention to her lectures  you'll do great on the tests.
5,not an easy a  must do everything to a T to do well. she plays favorites and i was definitely not one. my advice would be to get on her good side and you should do well.
4,Her class was simple. So simple it was completely boring. Everything is common sense and nothing deeper. If you want a simple class that is uninspiring then it might work for you. I did appreciate the 6 absences policy.
5,I would definitely recommend this professor. Took her inter comm class and got an A out of it. Although she is friendly and fun in class  do take her deadlines seriously.
5,GREAT Professor. She turns an intimidating class into one that you might actually look forward to. Great classroom environment  she is incredibly helpful and a great person but she does have her rules about attendance  format  etc. If you do all the work and pay attention to detail  you can pass even if your speeches aren't great. Take her!
5,Superb professor. Very helpful and inspirational. If you pay attention and work hard in and out of class you can and should be a better speaker by the end. Sadly  only four speeches. There were some tape recorded assignments  some paper assignments  quizzes and two tests. Paper work is cake if you study. Study  practice  practice  study  practice.
4.5,Great professor for learning  but needs to be more lenient for a 100 level course. Grades a little too hard on speeches and assigns way too many other assignments and papers besides the speech itself.
4.5,Reid is a nice overall lady  but for a 100 level course  the material and work is absurd. If possible take another prof. Tons of busy work.
5,You show JC the effort and he will respect you back. There is a lot of knowledge in his head and a genuine interest in the students. Once you demonstrate your commitment you'll be freed to take your creations as far as you want to.
5,His enthusiasm was contagious  and I even appreciated his quirks. I still display those brass and copper mobiles in my living room. Judging from the other ratings  I was very lucky to get on his good side.
1,So confusing because he says he wants you to be creative but then shoots down your ideas. He tells you exactly how he wants it done even though its your art. No real free will in the class. You basically are only learning his style of art.
1.5,"JC is an interesting guy but a TERRIBLE TEACHER. Makes you feel like you have to do what he wants on your own projects  says everything should be simple but then ""wishes you had put more effort in"" when the finished project isn't elaborate. Spends forever explaining. Gave me B+ though I followed his directions exactly and took all his suggestions."
2,Whoa. This man is kind of crazy. Expect to put A LOT of work into his class and not really understand what he is saying. Does not believe in grade inflation like the rest of the world.
4,I love JC. It's obvious that he loves what he does and is always really excited about it. I know sometimes it seems that he wants to implement his ideas on the students  but he really does know what he's talking about. He really wants his students to do well and he's always there fore support and guidance. I find him hilarious... he does too.
4.5,At the lower levels  Form and Space  JC was confusing and frustrating to have as a teacher. However  I found him to be a great guy and an even better professor when he is teaching a smaller and more advanced class. Although boring at times  he teaches technical aspects to sculpture that cannot be matched. If you do the work  you will be rewarded
1,"Played favorites - would spend 15 minutes helping one person and 1 minute helping another  always said he wanted your creation to be ""simple"" but always favored the elaborate projects  acted as if projects were very open-ended but then acted as if they had to be done his way"
1.5,Has a problem accepting other people's ideas. Loves work to be geared toward engineering appearance and simplistic. Hates color and extravagant projects. Then again  he has big expectations for every project and spends hours elaborating on how he wants it done exactly.
2,No Comments
1,"As long as you do exactly what he wants you to do on YOUR pieces  he is fine. Huge Ego- worst teacher I ever had!I think he ""fabricated"" the pyramids  or something."
3.5,Didn't he discover how the pyramids were built or something?
4,Didn't he discover how the pyramids were built or something?
2.5,i really didn't like the class because when i tried to come up with ideas - mine were shot down and he gave me a new one i felt like i had to go with.... anyways i did alright in the class but i wasn't happy with the way he guided my ideas so much
1,Awful -moody and plays favorites.
1,No Comments
2.5,do not be fooled by his seemingly nice appearance  he is an evil  self-absorbed  tyrant. professor galt is much better and more open-minded.
4.5,hard to get used to... but knows his stuff and will help you more than any other skiddie art prof
1.5,Worst art teacher I have ever had. Loved himself. Discouraged all creativity. We disagreed on one project and he was unbeleviably rude to me  and because of our disagreement he almost failed me.r DONT EVER TAKE A CLASS WITH THIS TEACHER.r Awful. Im and art major  and I have never been so disgusted.
5,excellent
4,Takes time to provide useful examples
2.5,No Comments
3.5,The subject matter isn't easy  but Ziller did a good job of taking the time to explain anything we didn't understand.
5,Funny Russian accent and cool guy. Great examples in physics for calculus problems. Found lectures really interesting using MAPLE programs in class. Very helpful in office hours and was available outside of class for questions. Really nice math prof.
3,I studied more for this one class than all my classes combined and I am a pharmacy major. I received the highest grades on the midterm and final out of 12 people in the class and he still gave me a B! how does anyone get an A? Im glad I heard he left or hopefully fired. He does not care about the students  yet about boosting his ego.
1,"Because of this professor I am suffering from depression :'( PLease switch as soon as possible.. in the begining of the semester  I came on this site to check his ratings.. I though  HEY maybe he is not bad.. I will give him a chance.. GOD  only If I had dropped the class in the begining  I wouldn't have an ""F"" on my transcript :'("
1,"I usually don't listen to what people say on this thing... but what they say about him is right! Everytime I think about this ""teacher"" I get a weird headache and I feel depressed or angry I don't even now. No Joke. Try your best to switch out."
1,"Please  just whatever you do.. DO NOT under any cirumstances take this professor.. He is a very difficult teacher.. he wants you to"" THINK LIKE A PHYSICIST"" the problem is that WE students can't think like a PHYSICISTS. because DUH!!!!!!!!! we are not PHYSICISTS.."
1,He doesn't teach you besides his own theoretical/proof crap that doesn't make any sense. You must learn on your own with the textbook but must follow his own way of teaching. He doesn't help you at all in the lab and claims that he has no office hours. His questions are similar to the textbook on the midterm but the final is a diff case. Final say:
1,He is crazy  he wants to learn a chapter a week. The midterm was six question for 8 chapters and the final 8 questions for 12 to 15 chapters. if it is not done the format he wants it to be it is wrong no matter what. Please Stay away. Any teacher is better than him trust me especially for pharmacy majors. You will end up repeating it again.
1,Pharmacy Majors !Wrong Guy! Take somebody else  especialy if you have to take organic chemistry with this class.
1,He is very easy. He always tries to scare his student at the beggining  but just like the NAZI regime fell so will he and in the process I got an A. Dont let him intimidate you. Also I dropped the class after I found out he was teaching so you should do the same.
1,No Comments
4.5,very hard teacher hard to pass most you can get is B exams are very difficult.
1,HE IS SO ANAL...GO BACK TO BOSTON...WE DONT NEED U...UR SUPPOSED TO BE A TEACHER...YET WE ARE NOT LEARING ANYTHING...MAN U DONT HAVE PASSION IN WHT U DO...I THINK U SHOULD RETIRE...OR REBORN
1,Hardest teacher  doesn't help his students... only 2 students out of 30 actually took the final in his class.. don't take him
1,"AWFUL WOMAN!!!extremely unfair and partial to stushe her ""favorites"" and totally fake. Never take her if possible."
5,Dr. Mallory is a great teacher. She is genuinely interested in all her students and makes it a point to learn everyone's name in the entire orgo lab.
4,Orgo lab takes ALOT OF TIME. Just a credit and you spend 6 to 9 hours in lab. Lab reports are lengthy and requires alot of work. Also  exams every few labs. Difficult to keep up with lab and exams. Take this single lab and no other lab!!!
3,O'shea is a easy professor is you do all of the online work  she's rude when you try to approach her outside of class. Her power points aren't very helpful  and her lectures do not help at all. Her directions when writing papers are very clear  but it is still difficult to receive a good score on them. The work is all online (quizzes and essays).
3,O'shea is an easy professor if you already know how to write a paper and able to commit your whole life to her class. Her in-class powerpoints and lecture does not match causing you to choose between what she is saying and her slide to take notes. However  its an easy A because its all online. I never went to class and ended with a A.
2,This Professor seems to think that students can  and should  read her mind. Trying to write a paper for her is like trying to hit an invisible target. Her directions are vague  yet her expectations when grading are very specific and annoyingly subjective. She is also unnecessarily loud  I've made a habit of wearing earplugs to class.
5,She is a wonderful professor and you can tell that she is knowledgeable about history. She makes the class interesting and I ended the class with an A with flying colors. Make sure to follow her essay prompts  do the inquisitive  and have the book open for the test. She also gives bonus points so that's a plus. She's great!!
3,Class structure is great honestly
2,This professor is probably the worst history professor I have ever had. Her lectures are all over the place and carry little to no structure. I'm a straight a student and I'm taking this class just for the credit. So many people would send one friend to sign the attendance for them. Make this review the reason you don't sign up for her class.
4,She is a very good professor  funny  and really knows what she is talking about. Be ready to write several papers with vague guidelines.
4,She was the best history teacher I've ever had in my life! She was fair in her grading and even gave us extra credit multiple times. I usually am not good at history but her lectures were actually so interesting. She captures your attention and if you go to class she helps you understand the essay prompts and suggests general ideas.
3,The questions for the papers are poorly defined and can lead to a lot of confusion when writing them. Fair grader. Very boring class  you have to read the book online so there is very little reason to go to her class.
5,A hilarious teacher with a sense of passion for what she does. Ask her about the most interesting Roman leader and she will talk your ear off. Papers are tough  but put in the time and you'll get a good grade. Need the textbook for the papers. Overall  an awesome professor.
2.5,I honestly think this class was pretty hard. Definitely go to all classes if you are not a history person even though attendance doesn't matter. Lectures are kind of all over the place and I felt like some of the info didnt flow well.
4,A weird class in my opinion. Was confused a lot of the time and not sure how all topics related to each other  but her class is set up pretty clearly. She gives reviews the class before the test and is pretty much exactly what's on it. The prompts are hard to grasp for papers  but I never got lower than an 87% on one. I'd recommend still.
4,She is funny in a sarcastic way. Lectures are all over the place because she is clearly passionate about her class but the tests are easy with minimal studying and before every exam she does a review.
5,Great professor! Very enthusiastic and cares about her students. She is so genuine and nice. I hate history so this class was boring for me but very easy. Her tests are easy if you go to the review. She tells you whats going to be on the test the class before the test. She doesn't give out 100 on her essays but its ok. Overall great woman :)
5,I loved professor O'Shea. She was great! Her lectures could be a bit boring sometimes but she always tried to keep everyone engaged in class. She gives 4 essays and 3 tests and 1 non-cumulative final. The tests are easy  she gives a review  but the essays can be a bit difficult. She can be a tough grader on the essays  it's easy to get a B on them.
4,O'Shea loves history! She's passionate! But is an extremely tough grader on her four essays. Most people attended class only for tests. Power points posted online but you would have read for extra materialdetails. Extremely organized.
4.5,Professor O'Shea is very smart and she knows what she's talking. Shes also very passionate about history  so her lectures are very detailed. Her mannerisms are hilarious and I would love to take her class again! She grades a little tough on papers  but not too bad. 4 papers  3 exams including the final  which isn't cumulative.
4,O'Shea is an amazing teacher. Really gets into her lectures and captures your interest. It's as if she is telling you a story in class. Four essays. Need the textbook to have successful papers. Tests are easy. Attendance isn't mandatory but go to the review sessions before the test. She basically tells you whats going to be on them. Great class.
4.5,I loved her as a professor  really nice woman. Tests aren't hard  although the essays can be difficult  but take it to her office hours and have her read it  she will tell you what needs to be fix. Gives opportunities for extra credit here and there.
5,Professor O'Shea was an awesome and easy professor. Four papers  2 tests  and the final which isn't cumulative. She is a pretty easy grader  majority of the class got B'sA's on papers. Class isn't mandatory  she just lectures about the book. So you can just read the book instead. Really easy class  no homework either.
5,An icon in his field. Personable with excellent taste
1,he might know his material  but he makes no effort to let the students learn
2.5,P Chem can be challenging to remember all those formulas and equations. Hochstrasser may not be the best but definitely challenged us. Take-home exam tough and so was midterm/final. Do lots of problems until you memorized Schrodinger's eqn...
2,Terrible professor  not clear  includes too much information  unwilling to listen to questions in class.
5,His class is fun and interesting. The test is fair. Every thing is covered during lectures. Overall  he is a great teacher. I would recommand him for anyone.
5,He is awesome! I love going to his class every day. I know some people say he goes very fast  but he takes the time to answer questions and makes sure that every body is clear. Because he talks fast  his class keeps me focused and alert and excited! As long as you take the time after class to look through the material  you would do great!!
2.5,He expects way too much: 73 mechanisms for the final  are you kidding me? He does not realize that it's impossible to test everything on an exam. He will have a question about EVERYTHING! Very few people finish the tests in time because they are excessively difficult. And he goes over info in his lectures way too fast. Too bad he is the only choice
5,This guy is an absolute amazing professor! He taught the subject so well and I learned more in one day of his lecture then a whole term with Walker. The best O Chem professor at OSU but not the easiest.
4,"Overall  a good teacher. He does notes via chalkboard though  and doesn't post slides on Blackboard. So basically  you have to go to class. People say that he ""crams you with mechanism information""  but that is what O-Chem is. Chemical mechanisms. I thought he did a very good job teaching difficult material. Definitely buy the book though."
3.5,Good teacher. Attend class and take good notes. Im pretty sure he drinks 5 red bulls before lecture b/c he goes(literally) 150mph during lecture.
2.5,As far as his teaching ability goes  it is not too bad  Dr. Carter is very experienced in the field. However his requirements are ridiculous  asks direct questions from previous terms  it is extremely hard to even pass the class. I do not recommend him.
5,I did terrible in organic chemistry the first time I took the course. I took it again with Dr. Carter and I got an A! Mechanisms are a HUGE part of 331. He always asked students if he needed to slow down and no one spoke up. He was always willing to help and made it interesting. BEST organic chemistry professor! Take his class!
1,Talks too fast for lectures  tries to be funny but isn't  grades tough on exams  limited office hours and overall not recommended
2,He thinks cramming a whole bunch of mechanisms is the way of learning o-chem. Lack of clear explanation and talks in light speed. He grades hard too. Not recommended.
2,First 'D' i've ever received. Worked hard  but his use of blackboard and no lecture notes killed me. By the time I was done copying off the board he had explained the concept and moved on to the next one. Took Myles the next term and got a B.
5,Best Organic Chemistry teacher at Oregon State!!
4.5,Professor Carter is a great professor if you're willing to work hard. Lectures consist mostly of taking notes as Dr. Carter writes them on the board  but occasionally he will tell stories related to what he's teaching. He's very consistent in making sure that if we learn something one way  he tests us that way. Great professor  and very helpful.
3.5,Very nice and generous professor considering he was also submitting a major grant during our class term. He is very clear about what will be on midterms. Does not offer review sessions.
1.5,He needs to slow down  let students ask more questions  he thinks cramming you full of mechanisms will somehow MAKE you understand it. Has hardly any office hours  and just impossible to reach if you don't email him exactly the way he tells you to  he won't respond. The questions on the tests are fair  but the grading is ridiculously harsh.
1,a really arrogent person  thinks he knows it all  not interested in helping students  only interested in keeping his time with you to a minimum
2,If you arent an encyclopedia of EXACT PERFECT mrchanisms  catalytic cycles  and 3-d structs you will loose millions of points for trite mistakes and not be rewarded in any way for what you have learned or put reasonable amounts of work and thought into. Given the choice i would never take a class from him again
1,No Comments
1,He is very boring and overall not a good teacher.
1.5,Assignments are ridiculously above SOC 101 level  they are very unclear and constantly changing. Unbelieveably boring speaker. Rambles on about bizarre personal life. If she says she will do soemthing  she will not come through. PLEASE would the faculty do SOMETHING before she ruins more students' interest in sociology?!?!
1.5,Doesn't know how to teach...AT ALL. She expects you to read her mind. Don't bother to ask her questions in class  she doesn't know the answers. She likes to ramble on about her personal experiences. Easy A. Stupid assignments. Horrible teacher.
1,Save yourself the headache. If you are late  you'll probably sit in the corner with a dunce hat. He'd make people sit along the wall if they were late. He spontaneously picks on people  it just gets annoying. The 1st day he lectures on his life from age 3-present time. You'll feel like you never graduated H.S. or that you're in the twilight zone.
2,Hard in any eco class I took. Using only book examples and jokes. No real life exposure. Worst economics Prof. Pace has to offer!
1.5,Hard everything. No review. I mean it RUN!!
1,Has no respect for anyone. He's not a teacher  but a clocker. Should do something else in his career  awful professor. Exams are MC and tricky. Gives no partial credit. STAY AWAY!!
1,The most incompetent and offensive A/H you will ever encounter in your life. Stay away from this professor  and you should have a rewarding college experience.
1,A truly horrible professor. Very unhelpful  not available after class  insults his students  does not know the material  makes many mistakes while going over reviews for tests. Only gives two tests during the semester  which the class grade is besed solely on. I give Michael Scarlatos an F- grade!
1,one of the worst professors of the past century.
1,Bad attitude  bad professor. What else is there to say?
1,This guy sucks. trust me  dont waste your time. If you have any shred of individuality  he will put you down and glorify his stupidity. complete waste of time. He should have been fired a long  long  long time ago. Happy New Year.
1,HE IS SO INTIMIDATING AND HE MAKES HIS STUDENTS AFRAID TO PARTICIAPTE IN HIS CLASS. I DIDN'T LIKE HIM AT ALL AND I WOULD ADVISE ANYONE WHO GETS HIM TO RUN!!!tHERE ARE BETTER ONES OUT THERE!
1,I've had my share of bad professors at Pace but he's by far the worst prof. He doesn't teach or know how to teach. Whatever his case is  he's a jerk who enjoys seeing the students sweat by constantly putting you on the spot.
1,I agree with everyone. Such a bad teacher. Actually he redefines the terms of a bad professor. Worst prof. ever. He's mean and seeks to humiliate his students.
1,hard to understand and doesn't help you out. 2 exams. midterm and final. exams are hard. i got my first and only D in this class.
2,Took him a while back  left with a C- and tred very hard. Reason why my GPA suffered. He doesnt teach well and his exams are just brutal. If he is the last teacher available wait until next semester
1,I am a student from Baruch College. I took his class in Spring 2004. I admit he is the worst professor in the world. Check what Baruch students say about him. Terrible....!!!
1,JESUS CHRIST OF NAZARETH. I HAVE NEVER SEEN A BAD TEACHER IN MY LIFE UNTIL I TOOK HIS CLASS. HE IS JUST THERE FOR THE PAYCHECK. PLEASE RUN IF YOU CAN.
1.5,Dropped the class after seeing syllabus. Class didn't have much students to begin with.
1,stinko
1,horrible man  i hate him so much!!!!!!!! don't take him  don't care about students
1,get out of pace!!!!
2,Mean  unapproachable  unhelpful
3,Ok I change my mind! I thought she was cool  but NO!! She is only friendly with her favorite students. I never got the TA job even with my super high GPA. Very rude  cold and unapproachable. Never get your lab reviewed by her  she takes off marks!!
4,Very helpful. Was the key to success for MA240. Would have failed without her.
5,tinas labs are better than trevors
1.5,Condesending  mean  wants to see people fail  some ridiculous ideas. if you can avoid her  do it
2,Condescending  arrogant..........back off lady  you only have a BA!!! Absolutely NO sense of humour  turned red in the face yelling at me because I made fun of one of her stuipd assignments........good luck if you have her  you'll need it!!!
4,Tries her best to make calculus as comprehensible as possible. She's nice.
3,No Comments
1,What a condescending person! So not approachable
4.5,She's very helpful in labs....Very approachable... Easy to talk to.. Explains very nicely.
1,No Comments
2,Slow to respond online  could have been due to small class size so less priority  but still..
2,She grades tough. I had another teach re grade papers and the grades where very different.
3,Her class was offered to me through APUS. She was very helpful  though there were quite a bit of essays and you truly had to try for your grade. We also had to read a novel chosen from her list for the final essay. BUT-- her grading on the final essay was very lenient.
2.5,Dr. Branch was a difficult teacher to work with. Although she was helpful when it came to projects  the answers were usually vague and not direct. When grading  I felt as if she graded based off of personal opinion rather than the facts that were clearly on the paper. Helps you to become a good writer but not a great one.
5,I took almost everything that Branch taught @ Guilford College a few years ago. I thought that she was the most thought-provoking  engaging scholar. She was also very approachable and genuinely invested in the success of her students. She inspired and still inspires me to Go Deeper. Novels  articles  & other forms of research were our textbooks.
4,Incredible teacher of post-colonial literary criticism!
4.5,Great Professor! Yes  everything is about race  but that is just where she focuses her interest. She has her opinions  but is willing to listen to yours as long as they are backed up well.
4,"she says ""kinda sorta"" a whole lot and that bothered me but if you dont mind people that use the same catch phrase over and over again she is a good teacher. You can learn a lot from her."
3.5,i loved the class i took with her and i thought she was a great teacher.
4.5,Was open about her own opinions so we could start off an honest class discussion as equals. Unlike certain other English professors *ahem-carolynbeardwhitlow-cough*  she embraced different views on the text as long as they were sufficiently supported.
4,Eleanor intimidated the hell out of me when I first had her. She's smart  can defend her views  and expects the same out of you. Beware the eyebrow of death. Once I got to know her she was charming  warm  and blindingly intelligent. Though she focuses on race  I never felt I was evil for being white or that I was graded down for disagreeing.
2.5,Doesn't like upper/middle class white people  I never felt like she was taking me seriously. I agree with the previous poster  she can be catty. Everything had to do with race in her class  it got old  fast. There's other literature to read other than stuff on race!
3,Had the ENGL102 course with her as a 23 y/o transfer student  and quite frankly the lady can be rather catty. Overall  however  if you can support your views adequately  she is quite open minded to voices of dissent in the classroom. Also  don't take her
3.5,I had Race in America  and although we differed on our views  she was clear on her views  and on her expectations for the class.
5,GREAT class! I learned so much and the professor was fantastic. She even gives you an excellent study list prior to major exams. I found her course to be enjoyable. The labs were fun too. However  it is not a course for lazy students.............you must study.
3,Took this class online - Teacher didn't have much communication with students - All book work with quizzes  mid-term and final were weighted HUGE and were on campus. Felt lucky to skate by with a C based on basically teaching yourself -
4.5,Very Good Teacher  took her class on-line while deployed and was very understanding and helpful with my situation went out of her way to help out
4,Read the book  go to lecture  pay attention  go to the labs  DO something in the labs  turn in the assignments. In other words  just do what you should be doing in any class. You will at least pass if you do this much.
1,Horrible teacher!
1,Very hard/rude teacher. Would normally be an easy class. She refuses to help you with any concerns  and copies quizzes from an online database that doesn't go along with the BOOK  leading to a high percentage of low scores.
1.5,Very confusing professor. He will go on a tangent about cars  golf  wrestling  and friends for the entire class and it becomes entirely pointless to show up when he just confuses you more. I will say he is very helpful when it comes to extending due dates on homework and quizzes if you talk to him about it so he's not entirely bad.
5,Awesome instructor. Will NOT hold your hand thru the course and give you easy grade  but very helpful  funny  does all he can to get students up to speed on Trigonometry. Even in 5 week course  he gets to the point so we learn what we need. Would take this instructor again in a heartbeat! The course was fast  he made it fun and understandable.
1.5,Can be all over the place when teaching
1.5,Cool teacher  but wack teaching methods
2,"Nice  funny & understanding about needing extensions on hw/quiz/test dates. Lectures are useless-Read the book and use online tools instead: He appears to have ADHD & either is redirecting because he doesn't understand the material or simply doesn't want to teach. He keeps changing what he ""meant"" to say/write. Talks about friends & cars  not Math."
1,He was really nice but did not seem to care about teaching or his students. He makes an effort to explain and just doesn't meet the mark. I knew more going into his class then I did leaving it. He makes a lot of references to cars and real life that do not really make sense when discussing calculus. I would not recommend taking him.
1,Do NOT take this teacher. If he has any idea what he's doing  which I doubt  then he does a horrible way of explaining it. All he does is act confused  change his mind  and say random things that don't make sense.
1,He is a nice guy  but did not explain subject matter well. I had to go buy several books to self-teach  practically moved into the math lab! He does go on tangents and only explains how to do the simplistic part of a problem. Not good when the math lab tutors know what teacher you have by how confused you are. Nice guy  but not thorough enough
2,Online class. Could take quizzes and tests over until you make a 100  just manage your time so you can do that. He's not much help when you email him. You aren't allowed to see the Midterm or Final and my grades were very low compared to tests  so I suspicious about the answers. One test didn't have them all loaded into the system. Not good to me.
4,Don't understand why these people didn't like him. He's very understanding if you need to make up homework/tests. And gives you partial credit on tests if you got the wrong answer  but were headed in the right direction. I loved his class!
2,Mr. Robertson is one of the worst math teachers ever. His teaching methods are strange  all he does is go into tangents that have no relation to the work. His tests are very difficult  including the final. The only good thing about him is his ability to work with you if you miss homework/quizzes/tests. Overall...bad teacher.
1,HORRIBLE!! unless you like a drill sargent  all i ever head him talk about is the pressure to get out of his class. if you ask for clarification  you get a quick response (not to the question you asked) and walks away. then he spends time helping ONE other student for the entire period.if you have math anxiety he is probably the worst choice.
1,WORST MATH TEACHER POSSIBLE! He was lazy! His class was absolutely useless. If you have a question about the math  don't even try. He constantly gets off topic and brings up things that have nothing to do with math  usually sports or cars. The subject is hard enough for most of us without him complicating it.. Don't take him!
1.5,He is incomprehensible  and pretty lazy. He has someone make out his notes and then gets confused by them. He was pretty funny only because he would talk about completely useless things such as golfing. So if you take him please learn... Your book will be your best friend!
1,He is the worst teacher I have EVER had. He is unbelievably unorganized and his teacheing style is beyond confusing. I had already learned all we did in class and needed a refresher  but he taught it in a way that made it confusing and completely messed me up. He hates to teach and that is apparent in his lectures. Do not take him!
2,IS VERY CONFUSING AND LOSES HIMSELF WHEN LECTURING. HE DOES NOT EXPLAIN THINGS WELL AND THEN WHEN HE GOES OVER A TEST HE TELLS YOU LITTLE TRICKS YOU CAN USE
3,I liked him!
1,He is HORRIBLE!!!!! Do not take him if you can. His tests are very hard and nothing is multiple choice and he has other students grade his work because he can't! He has even lost students work!
3.5,Its not as bad as everyone complains its actually easy just do the work. teach is very helpful under and above the table
1,He was a horrible teacher. He never helps you. Also  all his tests are do it yourself... no fill in the blank or multiple choice... its all on you own. He always relies on attendance and he has other students grade his work for him because he does not have the time to do it himself. I would not recommend anyone to take him as an instructor!!!!!
5,One of my favorite teachers . she is fun to be in class with and is very helpful with all the questions. I would defintely have her as a teacher again
5,I had fun in her class  and suprisingly enjoy the essay part. Make sure you stay on schedule with the essays because they can be overwhelming if you become behind. Her personality is very interesting
5,Dr. Baylard is the coolest teacher ever! Really understanding and answers all your questions VERY promptly. She is also very easy going about attendence and class behavior  but you won't sleep here  she's hilarious. Even lets you turn in 1 paper 2 weeks late. Some grade her down on showing up  but she's had unavoidable family & health problems.
1.5,I could have learned more from a trained monkey. She was absent for the last month of class. She provided very little communication about what was going on and left the class in limbo. She then graded our paper after her return. We lost the chance to revise our papers as stated in the syliby.
5,This is a great class a year later I still remember everything I learned I had a four hour one day class with her and did not hate going you should deffinatly take her for english.
5,Ms. Baylard makes learning English enjoyable. If you're wondering what English professor to take  Baylard is the best.
5,She explains everything in GREAT detail until everyone understands what it is they need to!!!
5,Great class. Dana made English an enjoyable subject.
5,she is awesome. lots of essays  but they are fun ones and she is great! :)
4.5,she is awsome! you shouldn't go wrong with this teacher.
4.5,Quality teaching with an upbeat attitude! She's a winner!!
5,No Comments
5,I'm taking her children's lit class right now. She's very interesting and tries hard to keep the class interested and attentive.
1,Can often act too silly or goofy while teaching  and will stray away from the lesson. Goes off topic a lot. Not good with words nor is she really understanding.
5,If seeking a compassionate professor  you have found one with Baylard. Clearly take an interest in student welfare. Easy to access outside of class and helps polish writing skills.
5,Good professor.
5,No Comments
4,She definitely grows on you if you stick with the class.. she's challenging but very worth it.
5,"She is a hard professors  but so extremely great. She gave me a love of english I had never had before. I worked my butt off but earned an ""A."" She's the best English teacher I ever had."
1,No
4,I really enjoyed learning in this class - Mima is very knowledgable and presented course topics with amazing enthusiasm. I didn't think I'd enjoy this course but I really liked the way it was taught. She is very caring and will give you the results you want  as long as you put in the effort she expects.
3,Mima is a classic lecturer  she truly is passionate about her field. She is rather dull though and does not get to know her students in tutorial  we had to use name cards the entire semester of a tutorial of 10. Essay is extremely straightforward  however the Final Exam should have been a take home memorize passages and DETAILED content.
4.5,The course itself uses no textbook  so she has her own slides she posts. The midterm/final comes directly from these slides. She is not a easy marker but a fair marker. If you write a B grade answer expect that grade. Read those slides and expect an B+ or higher. Also she adjusts deadlines and grades if need be. Overall very kind professor.
1,This was prove that history is useless and should be spent studying on while leisure
5,If i could I would pick Mima 100 percent again as a professor. Shes very decent  nice and understanding. Attendance is a must in order to get the marks.
5,Mima is a terrific teacher. She's very helpful and treats her students with respect. Anyone who has her as a teacher is lucky.
5,it seems as if the only people who don't like her lecture style are kids coming straight out of high school and looking to be entertained and have information handed to them. she has a classical lecture style and she is very well versed in her field and open to questions. understanding of busy schedules & more than willing to help her students
4.5,Easiest course ever just watched movies and compared them. Had a multiple midterm and essay exam and you get 30 percent for showing up.
2.5,This course is taught in conjunction with David Rondel  and he is amazing. Mima however  although she is a sweet lady  is not an engaging lecturer  and her lectures are VERY difficult to pay attention to because of this. Definitely wish this course was only taught by Rondel.
3.5,She's a really nice lady and very approachable. She'll definitively try to help you out if you have any questions. Her class notes were a bit confusing to follow but she does her best to explain them more clearly in the tutorials. Overall  a good teacher but tends to be confusing sometimes.
2.5,good but not that helpful
4.5,I'm a first year and I found her really helpful and easy to come to with any concerns. She is really nice and seems passionate about what she is talking about.Doesn't matter with lectures whether or not you come to class.If you pay attention  should be able to do really well.
5,She is nice and easy going. Actually she does not trick you with the midterm/exam and its pretty obvious on what you will be tested on. She is a fair marker though  so she isn't hard but she isn't exactly easy either.
5,She's the sweetest  most caring professor you'll encounter. Her passion for the material is infectious and she always tries to make tutorials interesting. Readings are mandatory in this class
4.5,She's fair and knows what she's talking about. Lectures are inconsistent
5,She knows what she is talking about. She is very clear. This is exactly how a history class is supposed to be. Her tests are very easy.
2,she hids behind a podium  reads from her notes the whole class  and has next to no interaction with the class. You don't have to go to her lectures as they are exactly the same notes that she posts online. As my first taste of a university level history class  i can say that i am not impressed. Anless u plan on a hst major  dont take this class.
5,She is a great prof. Very liberal and approachable. no need to buy textbook  just study wikipedia for the exams. everything is good except there is a long assignment to do ...
1,.
2,She cares about students  tries to be helpful  but sometimes she gives general/unhelpful feedback. The class is lecture-heavy for a practical class (Software Engineering). The lectures are kinda boring  she often uses jargons/big words  which sometimes give the impression that she doesn't know what she's talking about or have real-life experience.
1,She has no interpersonal skills at all.
2,This teacher is not effective. I graduated with a computer science degree from Denison and work in the industry now. She had no grasp of the material  and if she did  was not able to convey it clearly. When she retires  I will begin donating money to Denison.
4,I really like Joan Krone as a person. She is nice and helpful. She is not very good at structuring a class  but the discussions we had were for the most part good. She's good at letting students set their own agenda and independent study types of things.
1.5,She is a very nice person and easy to talk to but is also very flighty and vague about her lessons. She spent the entire class helping students who were either CS majors or knew way more than most of the students. One of the books is written by her and is missing half the program for each program. Don't take this unless you plan to major in CS.
1,Joan Krone is an interesting person. This is not to say that you should take her class. If you are planning on being a CS major  and have a background in programming  she can help you out. She  however  has no ability to grasp that not every student has the same knowledge coming into class.
5,If you ask her a question she'll answer it.
1,Bad teacher. Unclear  seemed to be confused  could not explain worth anything. I learned more from my brother in 30 minutes than I did from her the entire semester. I'd say about half the class dropped.
5,In response to a previous rating. The drop info does not say all thta much  simply because many students get into computer science not fully understanding what they are getting into. Dr. Krone is a fabulous professor. On the texts  CS171 uses common on
1.5,The drop information says it all. As an intro class  this is nearly impossible because she can't help you even if you ask. The books that we buy are hers  and they are error filled and no as helpful as on-line sites. Although she will let you drop.
4,Not good at lecture. Makes material more confusing  than needs to be. She is very accessible and will work with you  if she see's that you are trying  which is her best quality! On exams  tends to put material that was briefly discussed.
5,"Nancy would ask us to explain some phenomenon  and we would always say ""shielding"" (which was the correct but lazy answer in every case)  and she got wise and started requiring us to defend that answer. Since then I've never given an answer I couldn't defend  in any medium  on any topic. 4 instead of 5 for defriending me on Facebook."
5,One of my favorite teachers. Always willing to help you and is available after class if you're having trouble. Definitely recommend taking her.
1,She's very rude. Her lessons are very confusing and unclear. If you don't know the correct answer during class when she's teaching something new she's really rude about it and makes you feel stupid in front of the entire class. Her scoring is random and her attitude sucks!
5,She made chemistry easy and understandable. I'm disappointed that she isn't teaching CHM 112
5,AMAZING. She presents the material in a way that's understandable. Answers every question and does practice problems. Hw every night  3-5 questions. Tests aren't too hard and she's really friendly!
5,Wonderful professor  was struggling in the beginning. She took her time  made sure I understood what she was talking about. If you can take her whenever possible.
4.5,The best chemistry teacher I have ever had!!!! I wasn't doing well in chem and I always went to her for help..she answered every single question and took time after class to help me. Curved my grade which saved me!! She rocks:)
4.5,Great Teacher  easy to get along with  and is an easy grader.
3,She is really nice  and keeps class interesting. Answers all your questions. gives you homework first day and it is all due by the end of the semester. its okay to miss class
4.5,A Great Teacher - hard to understand at first until you understand her style after which you will love her
5,GREAT TEACHER.....A REALLY NICE PERSON
5,No Comments
5,She really knows what she is talking about  involves the whole class  and does it in a way that keeps the class interesting. She is one of the nicest teachers ever!
5,No Comments
5,One of the best teachers ever
5,She's one of the best teachers I've had at LaSalle. She's willing to devote any of her free time to you  if you ask for it. I've enjoyed her classes.
5,Excellent professor. The best one I ever had.
5,Dr. Jones is the best teacher ever!
5,Very good teacher  extremely knowledgeable. Always willing to help
5,Professor Pletcher provided me with two classes during my time at Denison University as an exchange student. Behind a fairly tough facade hides a wonderfully engaged  intelligent and brilliant teacher and professor. His classes were inspiring and insightful and instrumental for me in determing my academic path. Pletcher comes highly recommded
1,He is a very mediocre teacher  and doesn't seem to interact well with other students. He acts like political science is hard when it really isn't.
1,I would have to agree with the comments below. He is really ineffective and rigid. Not very personable either. I would try to avoid him.
1,One of the worst teachers at Denison. He is very arrogant and really needs to retire.
3,Pletcher is a brilliant professor  but I don't look forward to his class. He runs our freshman seminar 102 like a POSC 300-level. He also read student essays
1,Do not take him.
5,Best professor I have had at Denison. Extremely clear and interesting in class. He is also very helpful out of class. I have never met anyone so knowledgeable.
1,He is really arrogant and unfair. Not a very good teacher. Avoid at all costs.
5,Great professor--best at Denison.
4.5,The man will make you work for your grade  however  in the end  if you do not know the information  it is simply because you are not paying attention or reading. The man laids things out for you so clearly  that sometimes  you wonder if you are truly doing the work! He is that damn good! You would enjoy his class!!
5,This man is a genius. The class itself is extremely hard  and it's not my major or anything (and my first PoliSci class) so I have trouble with it  but he's really good about explaining things if you ask. I thought I'd hate the class just because it's SO hard  but I don't  because Pletcher rocks.
5,extremely intelligent
5,I agree  he's the best teacher I had at Denison. I learned more in his classes than any others.
5,Best prof on campus.
5,makes you work like crazy to earn your grade  but you learn so much...and he's a really fair grader  which is always good
5,No Comments
5,IPE  hard class  but man I learned a lot by the end of the semester. Great guy too!
2,His way or the highway. Get out while you still can.
1,She is not helpful
2,All she does is stand in front of a computer moniter and reads off the powerpoint...The class is NOT interesting
4,I had Ms. Hampton this past spring  and I must say  it was quite a challenge. I can see why people may say that she really doesn't interact as much with the students during class...but on the other hand I have to say that she is extremely smart. She definitely knows her info. I received an A but it did not come easy. Overall  she was a fairly desce
1,She is the worst grader ever. She felt sick for half of the semister(its ok) but she didn't grade my research paper extracredit paper and finals(given by some other professor)right  which cost my GPA to go way down. Defenitely not good. DONT TAKE HER>DONT KNOW WHAT SHE IS TEACHING.
1,She is the worst teacher that I have ever taken. Please do not take her. She talks too fast and reads straight out of the book. I did not learn anything.
2,LIke someone else said  avoid her at all costs. She is very bright and knows her subjects well  BUT she is not good at teaching or writing test questions. She does not use outlines or review questions. You will either sink (and most do) or swim. AVOID!
1.5,Everything I learned in Micro I had to learn myself. She basically just sits at the front of class and reads the textbook to you. All her lectures taught me is what to focus on for the test - sort of. She was never there for office hours  never availab
5,Excellent. She challenges you all the way through and will help you make IF you dont give up. She is worth the pain. You will learn alot from her. She is great. I took her for Bio 1612 also!
5,Ms. Hampton is perhaps the only teacher that challenged me to my utmost ability at GPC. If you are used to being spoon fed  she aint for you. If you are the type who loves challenge  I challenge you to take her. She is very fair  helpful and interesting.
1,I will advise you to wait for 2 years for a better instructure rather than to take her class. She is inexperienced and does not answer questions correctly  rather  she will give the question for an xtra credit. What a nightmare she is........
2,Oh my gosh! I just turned in my final and i wouldn't take this class if i were you. Dont get me wrong now  she knows her biology but i think as far as her method of teaching and testing
1,She is an inexperienced Professor  who basically reads an outline  and poses questions to the class throughout class. The worst part is that if most of the class failed a quiz or test(almost every class!)  she was totally callous & indifferent. Avoid her!
5,Great prof. He really made me think about life and how I think about things. He challenged me to venture outside the box and question what I believe and why as objectively as I could. Really showed me how closed-minded I was. This class is a must for first years. Essays aren't hard. Just incorporate what he talks about in lecture. READ THE BOOKS!
5,You. Must. Read. The. Assigned. Reading. You must. Otherwise the tests will be more difficult than they have to be and you won't understand his lectures as easily. He will also try and scare you out of his class in the beginning but don't be fooled. Only if you are willing to attend should you take this class. Excellent teacher.
5,This was possibly the best possible intro to Philosophy class I could have taken. The material was presented in a way that made it easy to apply the concepts to real life. Panos really makes the material come alive  and if you open your mind at all  you will do great  and leave with at least a new perspective on life. DO THE READING!!!
4.5,He knows what he's talking about and enjoys teaching his class. He has a somewhat rude manner but don't take it personally. I was intimidated to talk to him at first but when I finally did  he helped out a lot! Just pay attention  read and take good notes(:
4.5,He's belittling and rude because he knows what the hell he's talking about and you don't. Pay attention  take notes from what he says AND what's on the board. Ask questions if you don't understand something or want clarity.
5,great instructor. big on class participation. do the reading and take good notes on what he says  not just what is on the board. Some greek language needed to retain but not much. BE THICK SKINNED because he can make you feel small but know that everyone there is exactly the same.
4,Great teacher if you pay attention and you are actually interested in philosophy. Most of the kids in my class who failed never paid attention. You must be a good note taker and take notes about what he says  NOT what he writes on the board. Great class though. Very useful  really makes you think.
4.5,Alexakos is one of the most interesting professors at Santa Fe. Really gets you interested in the material and explains it in a way that everybody can understand. Class is really tough and there is a strict attendance policy  but going to class will be not a problem. Very interested in philosophy after this class. highly recommended
4,If you enjoy participating in class you have to be thick-skinned. Pannos is a great teacher  but if you don't give him the exact answer he is looking for he can be really dismissive. It's not personal. It's just his manner. He is extremely knowledgeable but the only point of view that really matters is his own.
5,Alexakos is one of the best teachers I've had at Santa Fe. I took Philosophy my first semester and failed. so i was dreading round 2. But he is so passionate about the material and so approachable in and out of class. The assignments and tests are easy and he loves to help with the 500 word essays assigned throughout the semester.
5,He is not interested in your commentary on the test or vague questions that leave other students looking for the Blackberry. Ask only questions that will help you or others understand the material and you will be fine. If you are interested in hearing yourself talk go somewhere else.
4,He teaches good philosophical ideals  but he does not follow them himself in the class discussions. He likes to cut people off before they can finish their sentence. He has some interesting concepts though and teaches the class well. There are only four graded papers composing 80% of your grade in the class. Dislike.
4.5,I love Philosophy & taking it with him was great! Respect him  always go to class  get the concepts  read what he assigns  and be able to write a decent essay. :) & Don't be scared to ask questions or share what you think. BUT he will tell you when you are wrong. hahaha.
5,Panos is an excellent philosophy teacher who knows his stuff very well. He is indeed hard and will tear you down if you dont know what your talking about  but if you are respectful and attentive in his class you will do fine. Also study and read all information given to you and come to class regularly. I got an A because I did all these things.
1.5,Dr. Alexakos will expect you to write a PHD level paper in his class. If you are cool with a B this wont be a problem  if you want an A take someone who is actually willing to give them for undergraduate level work.
3,This is not an easy class. One should not expect to walk in and ace it. You will never use a textbook in his class which is nice. Instead you use 5 small-large books. The class is a study of philosophical ideas and how they can be applied to morality in daily life. Your grade is mostly comprised of two papers and 2 tests. Tests = easy. Papers = not
2.5,DO NOT TAKE THIS GUY. Failing so had to withdraw  should have looked on here before. very hard class he is not clear whatsoever on what he says and it only gets harder. DO NOT TAKE HIM
2,Ethics not very ethical. Unable to make office hours- -had a mandatory attendance class at the same time. Despite this  I did see Panos a few times so he could review my essays. I followed his recommendations exactly and still got a C. Couldn't win.
4,If you don't like philosophy  DON'T take this class!! The concepts are very hard  but Panos does very well at explaining them. If you read the text  listen in class  and know each concept inside and out  then you will do fine. There are 2 papers which are easy. He's a good  funny teacher though.
3,I did not elect to seek Panos in his office hours  mainly because I had classes during all of his hours. This hurt my grade significantly as he does not clearly outline the expectations on the papers during class time. Had I gone to hours I likely wouldn't have had this issue.
5,He's really smart and a good teacher. He gives a lot of extra credit for showing up to review sessions and open labs and will explain things you have problems with. He's my favorite A&P prof I've had so far.
5,Professor Kent is extremely smart and makes it clear he wants his students to succeed and understand the material he is teaching. He gives you all the tools you need in order to pass his test. He gives you so much material and lets you know exactly what is on the exam. I would take him again!
5,Dr. Kent is awesome. His lecture and labs are the most difficult I've ever had but also the best. I graduated the RAD program 2 years ago and his classes helped a ton in the long run. My advice? Worry less about the textbook and a lot more about what he SAYS and writes on the board. If you can't listen/recall what he wrote on the board you'll fail.
5,Dr. Kent is very smart and he makes that very obvious. His tests consists of a lot of critical thinking but he certainly gives you the tools to succeed. He has weekly review sessions to go over essay questions and even gives extra credit for attending them! I would take him again! Do or do not  there is no try! you have to put forth the effort.
5,Dr. Kent is a very helpful professor and is willing to help all the time. His tests are hard but he gives you the material to do well on them. He is very caring for his students and wants everyone to be successful. I would take him again if I could. Work hard  ask questions  and go to review sessions and you will do great. He is a great professor.
5,"Dr. Kent is brilliant and passionate about teaching. He tells his students every day ""If you don't understand please stop me."" He truly desires student success but you have to put in your part."
5,Great professor. Very intelligent and you will learn a lot. If you put the time and effort into the class you will do well. He is always willing to talk and help you out. I would take his classes again.
5,I cannot understand how anyone can say that Dr. Kent does not offer feedback. He is always available after class and during office hours. He will answer any questions you have but you have to ask. Don't expect him to know that you don't get something. ASK HIM. Tests are intense but he practically gives you the test in his reviews! STUDY THEM!
5,Hands down the best A&P teacher at VSCC. He's infinitely knowledgable and doesn't just read from slides -- he physically teaches on a chalk board. Extra credit is available on tests as long as you really put effort into studying the material. Sometimes it feels like he's moving too slow  but it's all because he cares about student comprehension.
5,Professor Kent is hands down one of the best professors I've had my college career. He gives a ton of extra credit and tells you exactly what he expects and what he'll ask on his exams. He's extremely knowledgeable and a great person in general  a real gem. He always comes to class with a smile and a Hawaiian shirt on.
5,Kent is a great bio prof! For A and P  I recommend him 110%. I learned so much! It's a lot of memorizing  but he gives you study guides  out of class help  and extra credit on exams. Show up and pay attention  and you should get at least a C or better.
4.5,Dr. Kent is flicking awesome... most definitely NOT EASY but A&P isn't easy and I am grateful to have had a professor that was so committed and knowledgeable since I have drawn greatly from what I learned in his class.
3.5,Dr. Kent is one of the best teachers I have ever had. He is very thorough and passionate about his work. He is very approachable  likeable  and generally a nice guy. He gives tons of extra credit on his exams but his exams are tough. He gives a study guide and will tell you what essay questions will be on the exam. You can pass with an A.
4.5,I love Kent!!! It's A&P  so yeah  it's work. But he is ultra nice and helpful. You know exactly what essays you will have on tests  so if you prepare those in advance that helps a ton. The hardest thing is his TF on exams. He loves teaching and always remembers everyone's name. Always study a couple hours every day and you should be good.
4.5,Hardestsmartest professor I've ever met in my life. He was even the co-author of our textbook that many colleges use  lol. I only earned an A in his class because of his incredible teaching ability. He will fill the entire board up multiple times per lecture but you better write every word of it down. He never gets off topic and always helps you.
4.5,Dr. Kent is my favorite teacher. He is very thorough and tells you everything you need to know. Studying is a MUST for this class! Especially for the essay questions  but he gives study guides that literally has EVERYTHING on it you will need. So helpful  always made time if I didn't understand something. Also gives amazing extra credit.
4,Dr. Kent's class is tough  but his willingness to help makes a good grade possible. However  because he is so passionate about what he teaches  he is extremely thorough. As long as you don't mind putting in the hard work  Kent is a great teacher. He truly cares about the success of his students. I had him for A&P1 L and taking him again for A&P 2.
4,Great Professor!! Will be taking him again!!
3.5,Dr. Kent is a very thorough professor. He gives a ton of information and the tests can be difficult. As long as you study the essay questions and notes  an A is possible. He gives a lot of extra credit on every test. Highly recommend.
1.5,This man is to smart for community college. He needs to be at a university teaching students that already have a degree  not first or second year students. He doesn't offer much help and talks WAY above students level.
2,This class has nothing to do with the course description. It is a web design class and I don't know why it's not being displayed as one. Sanders is a really nice guy but he doesn't know how to teach. His tests are hard  he doesn't know what he's doing in class  and excepts you to know everything. Unless you're a MWD major  don't take this class.
1,This is by far the worst professor I have ever had. He does a horrible job at explaining things  he lectures you when you don't do well on the exams  he claims the class is easy all the time which it's not  and he is so insulting. The reviews for the exams and study guides are completely useless. DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!
3,He is hard of hearing  but very nice and understanding. He easily gets off topic  but is funny in his own way. We learned PHP and C# and you kinda have to teach yourself.
3,He is hard of hearing  but very nice and understanding. He easily gets off topic  but is funny in his own way. The Visual Explanations Book is hard to understand  but you will be tested on it. This is a web design class so be prepared to code and use Dreamweaver.
1,Don't ever choose this professor for any course. I took him for a Hunger class and he absolutely hated me for no reason. He's very rude and arrogant. He gave me a C in the class when I calculated my grade to be a B+. This man is corrupt and bases grades on how well he likes you.
1,"He is a horrible professor. His website is as awful as he is. http://sandlight.com/ ""design patterns are such stuff as dreams are made on"" is his catch phrase on his website. That doesn't even grammatically make sense  never mind the fact I have no idea what it means. I don't know how he can criticize anyone else's website. He is cocky/rude. AVOID!"
1,"He continuously asks you to redo projects and then drops your grade for handing them in ""late"". He spent most of the classes trying to figure out his own code rather then teaching us how to code things."
2.5,Got off topic quite often
1,Extremely unintelligent  though well-intentioned. The Hunger class was a breeze if you read the books  but don't expect to learn anything whatsoever from Sanders. He spends most of class time showing videos and telling personal anecdotes. Easily distracted and incapable of clearly answering simple questions. Easy A if that's all you care about.
3,Very intelligent guy but has trouble teaching it to others. He got off topic easily. We used three books that seem to be above what students can comprehend. Students really have to think to connect what the books are saying to web design. Hated the Tufte book. Exams are pretty easy if you have the slightest idea what you're talking about.
2,He is not a good professor. He is very intelligent about the topic but cannot relate it well to the students. He does not fully explain himself. He puts code up and expects you to absorb it and be able to understand what it is all about. The MWD department really needs to get another professor that can teach this subject.
3,very nice man  though his ego was quite apparent...rushed CSS too much
4.5,Awesome teacher.
2,really nice guy...needs work on his teaching
1.5,Gets confused easily. Assignments/tests can be difficult because you don't know what he wants or will ask. Definitely has favorites. Gives a lot of projects along with quizzes/tests. Almost deaf! It's hard to ask questions in class.
2,aloof
1,Seems to get flustered on opening basic programs such as powerpoint
3,Dr. Sanders can be VERY vauge at times but his is the nicest guy in the world! And if you want to get out of a test just keep asking him questions about 1. anything with technology 2. his sandlight productions website!
2.5,good guy tries hard but is about past his prime. can be a useful professor but will take some patience.
2,This course was all over the place. We used 4 books on what seemed to be totally unrelated material. His lectures make no sense whatsoever.
5,She is an amazing instructor  who has much knowledge.
4.5,Have taken many classes with Gel. She's highly recommended. If you want to learn how to dance  go to her.
5,Gel is really a great teacher. Knows the material backwards and forwards but has a way with personalizing the material as well. She knows what it's like to be a student. Will certainly take more classes with her.
5,Such a great professor. I took this class for extra credit. Very much enjoyed it. Such a great teacher. Really knows what shes talking about.
5,Great class  great professor! Gel and the class itself is difficult but if you tough it out you will not only plass but develop useful skills as a dancer.
4,If you do not like to be picked out in front of everyone do not take the class. She has favorites and uses them to demonstrate and calls them out. It can get very frustrating.
5,Wonderful professor. Certainly cares about her students  and does anything she can to help them learn and grow- as long as they are willing to put forth the effort. This class will better you as a dancer and a performer  and you will learn more than you anticipated  I'm sure. You won't regret taking a class with Gel! She's great :)
5,Very fun but challenging class! If you're open minded  by the end of the semester you'll know how to tap. Gel is one of my favorite professors. She's hard  straight to the point  and a great teacher.
5,One of the best dance professors in RI. The class was very fun but probably the most challenging. If you're willing to learn she will help. Recommended professor.
5,I loved taking choreography with her! I learned more than I thought I would. I was able to express myself every week with solos I got to make up. The final was the best part! You get to create a 3-5 minute dance and perform it for an audience. The class sometimes felt like therapy in a good way. You have to journal on readings. I am taking part 2!
5,Best teacher in the department-perhaps the college. You get out of her classes what you put in. If you want to learn  you will. If you don't  you won't.Gives attention to all levels in the class. Whether an advanced dancer or beginner. Do not expect and easy A - expect to write and work hard.Put in the effort and the class is VERY rewarding andfun!
4.5,Gel is a wonderful teacher. She knows a lot about dance and the theater world and she is always telling stories about famous people she knows. She may come across as mean at first but once you get to working with her she is actually very nice and a great teacher. I recommend taking a dance class with her!
4,I had her for intro tap. She was a lot of fun to have as a teacher. I have been tapping since I was little so I knew a lot already but she had a totally different way of tapping then what I was used to. I found this experience a lot of fun and I am definitely looking forward to taking more classes with her!
2,She is very rude. If she feels comfortable with you she has no problem calling you out in front of the entire class  making you look stupid. Unless you are one of her favorites  she could care less about you  or how she makes you feel. You do get a good work out  but it's not worth the humiliation or the frustration.
1.5,NOT THAT GOOD AT ALL. AMATEUR HOUR
5,Had her for Intro & Int. Jazz.Absolutely loved her! Been dancing my whole life and I know a good teacher when I have one. Takes time to correct you individually and answer any questions  very encouraging as well. Caters to all levels as well. Some readings and short papers  but very easy. Attendence and proper attitude is a must though.
4,Gel is very nice. When coming to class make sure you dress appropriately. She tries to make class fun and pushes you to do your best. Work out and stretches along with combinations of jazz. A few handouts at first that you have to read and respond to but after that you just dance. Hard but worth it.=] Good class. you will definetly learn new things
5,Gel is incredible. You will learn life lessons as well as everything about dance. Other professors should take teaching lessons from her. She is one in a million! Love you Gel!
4.5,LOVE HER! you actually get a nice workout... its great :) love you gel!!
5,What can I say  loved her and the class!
3,He's an OK prof. Lectures are dry but mandatory as he has weekly quizes that count for 15 percent of your total mark. 4 midterms no final and exams are all written and very easy. No need to buy the textbook even though he says you have to. Read the powerpoints and come to quiz days and you will get an A.
5,AMAZING! take him for 415  he knows what he is doing. GPA booster
1.5,Lectures were extremely unclear  the first midterm was a disaster. No one knew what he was asking. Tries to be helpful but makes students uncomfortable instead. He WILL interrupt you throughout your entire presentation  making it very difficult to keep things flowing. The content of the class is good but the instruction of it was very poor
1,Big disappointment  avoid this prof and class
2,Ian is a weird guy and not a great instructor but it's easy enough to do well if you readmemorize the textbook and show up to class. He loves to hear himself speak so it's hard to have meaningful conversations. His marking is inconsistent and ambiguous at times. He doesn't really lecture so you have to read and memorize the book to do well.
4,GPA boosting. Show up to class  do your best  and youll get an A! Exams arent cumulative and the project was marked generously. The students tend not to be as competitive or as smart as what would be found in accounting or finance classes  since most just take it as an easy option. Class is not curved  and relatively easy to get in the mid 80s.
5,Excellent professor. Interesting practical class applicable to real life! Exams and assignments were straightforward and expectations were clear. Fair marker and good feedback. Some immature students whine and take it personally when they are critiqued on their sub-par work and challenged to improve. Recommended with Ian  and would take again!
3,He is willing to chat about the material and help you. However  half the time his answers don't make sense. Course has 3 non-cumulative midterms  a group presentation and the take home final is two essays. He can be frustrating and unclear but good lecture overall.
4,Not sure why Ian gets such a bad rep. He is not a super interesting prof but just show up to class and do other class work while you're there. You don't need to pay attention if you read the textbook instead. 3 non-cumulative midterms and a final project (3 questions answered in essay form).
2.5,Worst class ever. Super easy  3 non cumulative exams. Read the textbook the night before and you'll be fine. He's super boring and his lecture slides are just pages from the textbook that he wrote  and he just reads them out loud. But he takes attendance so you have to go to class and suffer through it. Doesn't know how to use uLearn either.
2,He makes attendance mantory  so if you want the 10% participation  you must go to every single class. easy quizzes. marking was unfair for midterm. did not specify what he wanted but when he marked  it was very specific. the marks ranged from 50 to 100. take home final.
3,I actually didn't mind him as a teacher. I felt I learned enough to get me through the rest of my SMO classes. The only thing is I feel his marking is sort of  bi-polar. I need awesome on the mid-term and project but then didn't do well on the final  which was take home  even though I felt I answered the questions. And he wasn't very helpful after.
5,Very easy quizzes and exams(10-11 MC weekly quizzes  1 short answer midterm  1 take home final essay) As long as you attend his lectures and pay attention you will do well. He is unprofessional in presentations as he does tend to interrupt  I didnt notice that adversely affecting my grade tho. SEE HIM prior to presenting so u know what he expects
2,Was very unprofessional during group presentations as he often always interrupts speakers in the middle of their presentation and would even answer his own questions in the end without waiting for class discussions. Quizzes and midterm are an easy 100% even if you've just skimmed the chapters and read his slides beforehand.
3,Show up for class and read the chapters. Class is really general and the final is a take home essay! easy A
1.5,This class is basically SMO 201 with a little more description into HR practices. I hate this class with this professor because it provides generalized material with a teach who can not decide on a steadfast and concrete answer. Once you question his analysis  he holds a grudge. Take 311 with someone else.
2,Class was a total waste of time. Very little work and a group project where you can slack and a take home essay final (like an english class). Doesnt show what you know but rather how well you can write. Waste of 3 credits  not applicable to real world practises. (to be fair HR is hard to teach in classroom)
2.5,This guy is such a total joke. This is my second degree and I have never seen such a useless  lazy  teacher. He could never cut it in the real world so he has to teach. AVOID!!!
4.5,easy class  pretty interesting stuff.
3,She wasn't a bad teacher  but not someone I would recommend to anyone else. She makes you read a lot of books which isn't great but as long as you aren't an English major you'll be fine. We were supposed to have five papers and we only did three  and she cancelled class like four times
4,I had her for English 120 and she was generally an okay teacher. We mostly just talked about the book we had to read and most of the times we (or she) would go off on tangents. Not too many papers  mostly just reading and class discussion.
1,DO NOT TAKE.I switched into her class and not only is she a hardcore feminist that only gives women a chance  she is a really tough grader. She also doesn't care about her students (again  unless you're a woman passionate about feminism). Do NOT take her. She will have you rolling your eyes as she complains about male privilege.
3,A lot of reading which is to be expected. Class participation is key  if you dont talk in cass you are screwed
3.5,Good instructor  she's hilarious and has a passion for English that most people don't have. Participate in the discussions  come up with original ideas  and you'll be fine. Lots of reading (it is a Lit course) and two-page papers due every week. Participation is a huge part of the grade  introverts beware.
3,First impressions are everything with this professor. If you talk a lot  you'll get a great grade and she'll really like you
4,Dr. Carr is one of those English teachers that you either love or you hate. You will read a whole awful lot  but the books are generally interesting. Classes are just one big discussion  where basically no topic is off-limits. As long as you can read and just talk a lot during class  you'll get a good grade.
4.5,Professor Carr is one of the best professors I have had thus far. She is extremely open minded and loves to hear your opinion regardless of her agreeing with it. As for people complaining about the amount of books and reading  you can get her books cheaply online  and don't complain about reading when you are in a literature class. That is silly!
5,Really great teacher. Friendly. Funny. Easy to talk to.
4.5,This is my second time taking her class  and she is a spectacular teacher. Her class is heavily dependent on assigned readings and class discussions  but overall  is rather chill as she is very open-minded. You have to buy a lot of books  so expect to spend quite a bit of money. If you're not much of a talker  do expect your grade to suffer though.
3.5,Lots of books to buy for this class but they are all less then ten dollars. Sometimes less then 5 or free cause some are on amazon. If you are a person who does their work last minute all the time  dont take the class. She requires you to read chapters and discuss in class. she has strict rules  she will open your mind about the world. big femenist
4,I am in this class now and was dreading taking Eng.Lit. because I don't like to read. The class is run as a discussion group and we are required to write a paragraph or two about what we read and bring one to each class. She lets you know what's expected first class. She is funny and makes class go by fast. I would absolutely reccommend her!
3.5,This professor is incredible. People may hate her because she has you read some books you probably never would but its because she does that that she really expands your world and thinking. If you enjoy reading and thinking outside the box take her  she's a great first English class to take if your an English major especially.
2.5,Hmm  I'm not really sure how I felt about this teacher. Some days I liked her and others I didn't. She requires you to buy like 10 books for her class and you go through one a week. Class is just a discussion on what you read. If you like reading and talking out loud take this class. However I did not say a single word and still passed with a C
4,Final grade may be 50% participation but speaking in class is really not required. I spoke about 4 times  got A's on papers and got an A- in the course. I think as long as she recognizes that you are reading the texts and you are paying attention in class  you're good in her book. If you don't mind reading  take her!
5,AWESOME teacher all you gotta to do is talk in every class talk about the book make questions etc...only thing is that there is alot of books to buy read maybe as long as you know how to talk
3.5,This class is complicated at best. The class is seminar format with group discussions on every book. She gives insane writing assignments that make no sense. She is very nice  but the papers should be used for a creative writing class  not this. Overall though  its an easy class. 50% of the grade is simply showing up. The other 50% is essay-based.
1,AWFULLL! you have to buy a bunch of books and read them within a week. about 80 pages of reading for each class do not recommend at all. also her grading system is HORRIBLE! it's based on how much you talk in class but she doesnt let u kno how u are doing mid semester and very rude to students. HORRID EXPERIENCE
1.5,DO NOT TAKE! She is the worst professor I've ever had at RIC. Western Lit is a required Gen Ed course  and she gears it towards English Majors. Very rude  and does not care about the students at all. Requires you to buy about 14 novels  and you go through about one every week. Grading is based on her opinion of you. AWFUL!!
2,Horrid experience. Not a fan of reading  and we did a decent amount.. Not the easiest grader. Participation is important  but all that seems to happen is random rants completely off-topic. Pretty boring class.
4.5,pretty easy class..this guy owns a lawfirm though so it is early in the morning. i hate getting up early and i still managed to ace the class. tests are m/c and easy if you review your notes well. he also curved all the tests in my class. make sure you pay close attention cause he doens't repeat himself oftern. TAKE THIS GUY! STUDY ALL YOUR NOTES!
4.5,He's a very good teacher. And also a very nice guy. Everything in the class is helpful for real life. Test are easy  just review ur notes.
2,She is old-fashioned in her approach to teaching the subject matter. She is definitely not a political scientist and is probably best suited for a different discipline altogether. I found her courses to be poor preparation for graduate school.
2.5,Brutal workload based around unclear prompts led by unhelpful instruction. The papers felt entirely unrelated to the course material. I had to fight and scrape for my mediocre grade and I had one of the better grades in the class. When half of your students are bombing  it might not entirely be their fault.
2,Dr. Davis is nice enough  but she is unbelievably hard. Was pretty interested in Political Science prior to taking her class  but now  will never take another one. Really tough papers with very vague prompts. Avoid her FYS 102 at all costs.
4.5,Great teacher. Very willing to help the students  always available for questions. Definitely the hardest FYS on campus  but she managed to make it a great learning experience. I feel much better about my own writing skills than I did before this course. She can be intimidating  but she is super nice.
4,Dr. Davis is super laid-back and more than willing to work with students should they ask for help. The reading material can get a little dry  but I think Dr. Davis does a great job of leading class discussions. She is a great professor and mentor.
1,If you want to become misinformed about the truth's of the world take this professor. The answer for everything is War and America in this class. This is a class for narrow minded people.
2.5,The reading for my class was out of control!! And she didn't give very good feedback on papers so i didn't feel like i got that much out of the class.
5,This was a boring class. It was tuesday and thursday at 10 and all she did was show us powerpoint presentations that she had made a long time ago. She told us where they needed updats  but I still didn't like it. She was very nice and very helpfull (esp. for students needing extra time) but she did not bring the subject matter alive for me. READ!
3.5,she is a great teacher and I lover her in class  but she is very tough on grading
3,interesting...
5,One of the nicest  laid-back  easy to approach professors at this school. And tremendously  tremendously smart.
5,Easily the smartest teacher at Denidoo.
5,The best professor I have had at Denison.
5,I loved her. I have to agree with the person below me though  she can be pretty rude at times. Class was a lot of fun!!
5,Fun Class  Can Be A Little Rude At Sometimes But I Had Fun  Your Required To Go To 3 Shows and your final is a group project or by urself.... Class Got Me In Shape... I had Fun
5,I had Prof. Ward a few years ago. She is really nice and very helpful. It was the first college class I ever took and I feel fortunate to have had her!
4.5,I love Mrs. Ward! She is an incredible teacher and extremely helpful. I have her for Intro to Modern Dance  and it's a great class! Beileve it or not  it even puts you in shape!
4.5,okay  true this was a very demanding class. she gives a lot work for you to complished in the semester. I felt very overwhelmed sometimes but she is truly just trying to teach us a lot of material in one semester. she is a very nice lady and keeps you on your toes in class. Im glad I took her but I am also glad that I never have to take her again!
1.5,Teague SUCKS. Made me feel uncomfortable in every single class and there were days i wouldnt even go b/c i couldnt put up with her. Forces you to participate  treats u like a 3rd grader  papers are grammer and citations not material. Study guides did not help at all  very vague. Thinks all students have memorized every word from text. Avoid Teague.
3,very hard grader  especially on papers and she can be very sarcastic. if you do the IDs then you will do well on the tests.
2,Definitely too much work for such a simple class. She feels everyone is taking this class because tehy are interested in it  not because its a requirement. Her study guides are pretty vague but somewhat useful.The papers are about grammer and citation not content. The presentations also pose a problem since she gives no direction on them.
4,Homework is mostly ID's  gave 2 tests plus the final also 2 papers and you could rewrite the first one and two presentations  tests were not that hard she scaled both test  the papers are the most difficult but not the worst class in the world  i would really rewrite the first paper if you get a 75 or lower it's worth it
1,STAY AWAY!!! oh my god!!! she seems like a really nice person in real life  but as a teacher she is the hardest i have ever experienced!!!! even harder than bio 109 if anyone can imagine that!!! she was extremely hard and asked questions on the exams that had nothing to do with the study guide that she gave us. ALOT OF MEMORIZING GET INDEX CARDS!
2,TeagueTreats students like third graders.She has managed to make everything technological. Assignments have to be sent via email using ONLY MS Word prior to bringing it to class..making everything so difficult  stressful  and uncalled for.I'm not that fond of the abundance of assignments either.Sharon Teauge is very hard to please.
1,I am graduating this year and out of every professor I had  she was the absolute worst. She uses Kate TUrbain style on papers that she said I would experience all therough college  and what a surprise  turns out she was the ONLY TEACHER WHO EVER ASKED ME TO USE IT! She is way too hard  expects way to much out of you for a gen ed class.
5,Prof. Teaugue is an excellant teacher in my opinion. She LOVES the ancient times and is specialized in Medieval Wills. The school changed the text book so she wasn't always sure of pages  but is extremely helpful when you go to her with a question. Easy class if you do your id's and read.

4,Very challenging but I learned a lot definately a lot of work!
4.5,Although she is challenging  she is one of the better professors at RIC. Tests are crazy hard  and you have to be engaged in order to do well. She is really intense about grammar and writing because she used to be a writing professor. The papers are such a pain in the ass  if you are looking for an easy ride (slacker) do not take her as a professor
3.5,Somewhat condescending  but definitely one of the best teachers there. It might seem like she assigns a lot of work but NONE of the work she assigns is ever busy work (which is more than I can say for other professors). Do all the work and you'll get a high B or an A easy.
1,No Comments
1,If you have her  get out of it now before it's too late. Worst prof ever. Condescending  not very bright  grades papers horribly. It's a gen ed and she acts like it's a grad course. Expects way too much  not a fair grader  and she's extremely annoying. I just want to throw stuff at her when she talks. And yeah  she's concerned more with grammar.
1,She is such a flake and a complete airhead. She is aggervating & annoying. Dont take her class. you will want to hurt her before it's over
1,DON'T take Teague. Especially at 8am and it being your first college class ever. She seriously must thing that her class is the only one we have because she piles on the homework.
1,HATED her. she condecending  and had no clue what was going on. she made me not want to go to class  and that has never happened before. When it comes time for her papers  she gives you the materials that she wants you to use  which  yes was convient  but did not show if you actually understood the topic. she mostely grades the papers in grammer
3,I agree she is a wack job. When I had her she made us have study buddies and thats what we had to do for the beginning of every class. We got in trouble is we werent studying. However her grading is very easy as long as you follow intrusctions
1,She sucks. Totally stupid. jumps around and never gets to the point. It's May and she still has no idea that no one cares about her or her class. She spends the entire class babbling about things that are completly unrelated to History and she thinks we actually care about her class.

3,I'll admit i did learn a lot in this class. BUT it was one of the hardest classes i've ever taken. You have to study for all the tests  or there's no way you'll pass. Pretty much everything on the test is essay questions  and she grades hard..but if you're dedicated and take the time to study you'll do good.
3,Very difficult teacher. People are right  you do need all the time in the world to pass this class. I don't care if you're a genius  her tests are VERY difficult. Find another professor  trust me!
1.5,Yes  if you're lazy... definitely not the class for you. Even if you're NOT lazy... honestly... to be 100% truly honest... I would recommend finding another professor. Her lectures are very unenthusiastic and her tests are pretty hard... like from a scale from 1-10... definitely at least an 8.
3,this is mos def not an easy a. you really have to work your butt off. i dont recommend her unless you have all the time in the world to study!
1,try to take bio with another professor.
1,No Comments
3,Easily the hardest class i've ever taken. Lectures insanely boring. TAKE REALLY GOOD NOTES. Her tests are the hardest i've ever taken  and i'm an honors student. The tests are mostly essays! ESSAYS IN BIOLOGY! Take someone else if you can. If you have to take her  show up EVERY day and GET THE BOOK you WILL need it. Study as much as you can.
2,No Comments
3,She definately makes you work for your grade. She is a good professor that knows her stuff  but man she expects you to know a lot. Sometimes when you don't get things she looks at you like your stupid  but then she doesn't try to explain it so you would understand. I would take her if you know a lot about biology.
1,Don't take her!! Seriously  I thought everyone was just lazy and didn't want 2 do their work..but she is not worth taking..She is so unclear  and all of the tests are written (no scantrons) She treats the class like a major class...yes I did pass..but with this +/- system...avoid her!!
1.5,She is very confusing and somewhat hard. The book clarifies a lot  at least for me it did. Bio is a pretty interseting subject but she makes it boring. She's nice and does offer extra credit.
4.5,Ok if you are a lazy arse  dont take this class. But it's easy if you TRY and GO TO CLASS. do not need to open your book  just REVEIW ALL NOTES for the test and FOLLOW the study guide. If that's asking for too much  don't take the class... I learned a lot.
2.5,prof has very difficult exams. memorize all of your notes and the book. be sure to be in class every day  because extra credit will sure help your grade! try to take bio 101 with another professor if you can
4,you have to go to class or else you won't do well. her lecture notes are all the tests. just copy those and you'll do fine. she grades hard on the papers  but offers extra credit. i learned a lot from her.
4.5,Don't be lazy with your reading up and your almost garuanteed an A. Do what she says and memorize her lecture topics and the rest is downhill you pussies.
4,She really was a good teacher... it was a fun class  but watch out cuz its a lot of work. If you study EXACTLY what she teaches  you wont even need the book  and you will do fine. but a lot of studying/memorizing
3.5,The class wasn't that bad. If you work hard and study a lot  you'll get an A. I had never learned so much before from any other science class. She will help you out if needed  and the cd from the book helps A LOT.
2.5,She's a nice lady  but make biology harder than it really is. You have to read the book and study her notes to get a decent grade in the class. Go to her study session  write down EVERYTHING she says  cuz its MAYBE on the test.
1,she is crazy. this class is super hard. you have to be very serious about biology and read a lot. i dont recomend her. SHE MAKES NO SENSE!! she should retire  shes too old.
2.5,this class is EXTREMELY HARD and BORING!! She can be a nice woman and if you REALLY REALLY pay attention  which is hard to do with her  you may pass. The tests consist mostly of essays... basically dont take her if you want a decent grade!

5,If you are a serious English student  you will love Dr. Sherry. I watched a football player become a lover of Yeats. Dr. Sherry's voice is the way poetry should sound.
5,Professor Cherry was a great professor. Although he was hard of hearing  he consistently did his best to get everyone involved in class. It is unfortunate that he is retiring to become a surf instructor in California as he will be missed by the entire Villanova community.
5,Great  solid professor. People complain about the Electronic Journals  but c'mon  all he is asking you to do is write a response to a specific question he asks about the reading in 5-7 sentences. There are only 10 Electronic Journals  and two 3-4 page papers in this class  so its a breeze. Dr. Cherry is super knowledge and has tons of experience.
2,A paragraph was due weekly  grades were unclear until the end. He looks for very small details in all of the stories read. Close reading is necessary
4.5,Dr. Cherry is a great professor. It's a discussion based classed with a relaxed atmosphere where people can share their ideas about the text. You need to read in order to do well  but he chooses good texts for the class. He has a great sense of humor  and is clear about what he expects you to accomplish in your papers. I recommend taking his class.
2,He will not look over any rough drafts for papers you may have. The electronic Journals are the biggest nuisances you will ever get. His tests are very random and rely on very small facts from the books you have read. Do NOT be late  DO show up to every class  DO your Electronic journals and you should be fine.
5,Awesome! Sense of humor and likes South Park. Very helpful but expects you to know how to write already  from h.s. Teaches you to write BETTER. Fun discussions and he knows his stuff! Doesn't teach lots of classes  which is a shame. When he calls on you  SAY something. Participation = 15%. Essays = 40%. Electronic journals = 15%. Exams = 30%.
5,Definitely a good teacher.
5,I had Dr. Cherry for American Short Story. Unfortunately he doesn't teach much since he's head of the dept. VERY unfortunate. He's an excellent teacher and I would love to take another of his classes.
4.5,I had him as a permasub the last month of class. He saved the class from a bad teacher. He went back and retaught everything  making sure we knew the material. Accent isn't that bad. Talks about math on a personal level instead of math terms. If the grade on your final is better than your overall  he gives you that grade. Nice guy. Approachable.
2,Not a good teacher.
2.5,Has a wicked accent and wierd hand witing but he knows the stuff he's teaching
3.5,accent hard to understand.
4,He was a great teacher. I am horrible in math  and I made an A in his class. The tests are exactly the same as the review...get him if you can!
5,easy  reviews cover quizes and exams exactly.
3.5,"I couldn't stand her as a teacher. That said  her class helped me become a better writer. That helped me in college as well as my career. I owe her a big ""thank you""."
5,Professor Hilton was wonderful. She really made her assignments clear and her papers and novels were always very interesting and fun to read.
5,Pro. Hilton was SO interesting in her lectures  when i transfered my english teacher was lame compaired to her. However she is very specific on papers so take advantage of having her look over it and going to the writing lab. She is very helpful nice fun
5,Prof Hilton was awesome. Though her essay themes could be challenging  they were fun. And she was a fair grader. It was always very obvious that she loved her subject  loved to teach it  and knew her stuff.
4,I really liked her as a teacher but a lot of the people in my class thought she was a tough grader. I did well in her class (I got an A) I think she grades easier if she likes you.
4,Paul was amazing. He was so helpful in and out of class. I learned so much in his class because we talked about EVERYTHING. I wish I could thank him for everything he did for me.
5,Professor Grobstein was an incredibly engaging and downright lovely professor. I am very grateful to have had the opportunity to share stories with him. He will be greatly missed. -Rebekah
4.5,This is not a traditional science class by any means  in fact  it's a great class for non sciencey people who need a science credit. But it is definitely Grobstein's element. Other people complain about his philosophizing but that is exactly what this class is about so it was perfect. Fun  interesting class.
5,Paul is an amazing professor. He was able to take very complex principles and fully explain them to the class. I left the class with more than I would have every hoped for. He teaches science with a philosophy twist  and although I started the class completely perplexed by the natural sciences  I now feel passion for them. Great experience!
1,he is great for none science majors who want to learn some science  but if you are a science major i would suggest you find a different professor. he spends the whole class talking about his idea of science  but he doesn't actually teach it. When he does  he dumbs it down to an insulting level.
2,No Comments
4,I don't know what people are talking about. Prof. Grobstein is one of the best professors I've ever had in my life. If you really want to learn something  take his class. He really makes you think critically about issues instead of taking them at face value. How many teachers make you do that?
5,He was WONDERFUL! My favorite teacher thus far.
3,this guy can talk his butt off. half the time i think i'm philosophy class instead. hardly any use of any text. all discussions which i guess is good for a liberal arts school to a point but he's out of hand.
2.5,Paul needs to teach the science before he can philosophize about the principles of science. Frankly  you are wasting money by taking this class.

5,This Professor is awesome! He's so helpful and he's really interested in helping students learn. He encourages discussion inside and outside the classroom and he teahes you how to look at subjects from a new angle
1,One of the worst professors I've ever had. She tells you to follow the directions carefully but the directions could not be more unclear. She initially introduced herself as the head of the computer and technology department at AACC  but there is absolutely no way that's true. If it is  shame on you AACC. She doesn't know ANYTHING about computers
1,Terrible communicator. She does not respond to emails and when she does she is short almost annoyed you even asked. She does not do any grading AT ALL. The computer does all the grading and she does not check over to see even if that is correct. We were given extra credit assignments and she did not even include them in the final grade. Terrible!!!
1,One of the worst professors I ever had. She does not respond to emails  which is not good for a professor. Communication is a plus. She is all into herself in class. She does nothing but play on her little computer. She is good at telling you what she want to do when she retire. Good at telling students not to ask her questions  ask a group member.
1.5,Course is listed as online but should be shown as hybrid because you have to go to campus for tests. Have to email her multiple times before receiving a response and by that point it is too late. Uninterested in helping students in anyway. Horrible at clarifying what needs to be done. If you take her course you will regret it.
1,Teacher was extremely unhelpful  awful at grading assignments  and all the quizzes were poorly done. If you can help it do not take this teacher  it will almost be next to impossible to get an A!
1,I would recommend this teacher to no one ever. She's takes a month to grade assignments  she takes two weeks to respond to emails  then it'll be to late because the assignments due date has passed and there's nothing she will do you just have to take the loss. You never get a straight answer. The class itself is fine but the teacher is not for you.
5,Awesome class. I took it online and learned a lot. She grades fast and is very fair. She doesn't accept late work so if you are for that pick another professor. As long as you do what is expected and try hard you will do well. I loved this class and I found Professor Foster to be super fair. What you learn you will utilize in everyday life.
5,I took this class online. I loved the program it was in Snap. I knew exactly what was expected of me every week. I do not like the fact that the weeks are locked until current. Sometimes I want to work ahead and cannot. She is totally responsive and very encouraging. She grades fast and is fair. I recommend this class for sure.
1,Keep looking. Not helpful and a terrible teacher. She is not flexible at all (even if you want to work ahead for one week). I took her online course and I DO NOT recommend it to even an enemy!
2,Only take her class if you have to  if you can get a different teacher you should. I took her online computer class and she constantly changed the times things were due and closed drop boxes and quizzes/tests earlier than the time she said they would be closed on the syllabus. She wasn't overly helpful with anything.
3.5,She can be tough  but she's fair. As long as you do your assignments  you'll be fine.
4,Very outgoing and makes her classes fun and interesting. Wants all her students to do well.
1.5,Would not recommend her  she takes way to long to respond to questions (online course)  and takes even longer to grade assignments. I learned nothing from her  she is a course administrator  not a teacher. Also not flexible with anything. I would keep looking if you want a teacher.
5,She is very understanding and helpful! I would reccomend her to anyone!
5,I'm taking her Help Desk Concepts class online and I love it! It's so easy and the assignments are easy to understand. She's very quick to respond to questions.
5,She doesnt like getting up early thats for sure but ive never met anyone with as much energy as her in the morning. Hilarious teacher  a must have for your morning wake up computer class.
5,Professor Foster was awesome! Nice  very friendly  full of energy. Not all that hard of a class  I really learned alot though.
4,I liked her  easy class nice professor
5,Excellent teacher. Very good personality. She dosen't like getting up early and I had her at 9 am. She let us come to the 8 am final and hour late and gave us a short final!
5,Crockett's the most hilarious professor I've ever had  and he's retiring soon. Trust me  no matter what your major is you will NOT regret taking one of his classes.
4,Freaking love this guy- I think his F bomb record is 10 a class. Takes nothing seriously but really really knows his stuff. His goals are to make us laugh and help us view the world around us with a healthy dose of criticism/ humor. Probably one of my fave people on the planet!
5,Dennis' outlook is all his own and he particularly works from a cynical  critical and contextual point of view. Not only is he extremely knowledgable and insightful  but he is also hilarious and entertaining. He is the best professor I have ever had and being his student was a pleasure and an honor.
5,Dennis is by far the best teacher I've ever had. He's hilarious and brilliant. He is also an incredible person and anyone who gets to know him is very lucky. His classes are incredible--take one.
4.5,My favorite professor. I recommend him without reservations.
5,Dennis is the man. Of the many teachers and professors I've had in my student career (I have my master's now)....he is the best professor I have ever had.
5,Dennis has incredible knowledge about his subject and makes the classes laugh-out-loud entertaining and memorable. He also holds his students to a very high standard but is always approachable and helpful. He has remained a dear friend to this day  long after I graduated from Whitman.
4,Dennis is a great prof. He teaches you other things about Art History besides the common knowledge. He makes it fun  but also very challenging. You feel a real sense of accomplishment when you do well in his classes!
3.5,The easiest guy you could have found in the whole Brooklyn College English department for this course. I was lucky to have found him  we read couple of stories wrote two papers and one final paper for the semester  and the entire class got an A. Thats Amazing and Kool. He is not teaching any more  but we need Professors like him.
3,I think he might have retired by now but i had him for my Spring 2010 Eng 2 class. He made us buy this expensive book we used only for a while. During the semester he made us write only three stories and a final paper. And there it was we all got an A for his class. Not the best but not the worst either.
3.5,he's ok. i thought he was lazy. had us write a bunch of papers he'll not give back. BUT if you do the work and attend class  you'll be ok as i am sure i am getting my A. i think he is retiring after this spring semester.
1.5,Worst memory i ve ever had in college.
2,cool teacher  easy class  and hardly any work. i had him once a week for a night class. we never stayed the 2&1/2 hours  usually held us for 1&1/2 hrs. went through the readings with us in class so we knew what the material was. only knock on him is hes a tough grader. 1 midterm & final paper
4,Good Professor. Not a lot of assignments and is flexible with deadlines. Do the assignments and youll get a good grade.
1,No Comments
4,Class was okay  not very stimulating.I didn't feel very interested and motivated to write  and held off on the first assignment till the very last moment.I was sure that my grade was doomed already.However  once I wrote more pieces and class was over-he gave me an A.So as long as you do the work and have great grammar  there shouldn't be a problem
1,Teaches little  reads alot and goes on tangents. He is tough on grading. If he likes you (aka your attractive and is in his face alot and he learns your name) you should do well in his class.
5,Unfelpful? Are you crazy??? Well  if u want to sit back and not to do a thing then yes  he won't help. Prof Boyle knows his subject very well  encourages u to write better than average undegrad. student and he does a good job helping u to get to that level. Only those who are lazy can say such a thing about their belly-button lint.
5,I think this professor is great. He knows a ton about the subject and isn't arrogant. He is helpful with writing problems and encourages students. I highly reccomend him.
1,All I can say is WHAT AN ASS!!This guy thinks that all his students should write like the writers for the 'New Yorker'. The average grade in our class was a B- and there was only two A's. The guy has the personality of a box and is probably the most unfair grader in this college. Unhelpful.You will learn more by staring at your belly-button lint.
4.5,He was a very easygoing professor  and very fair. He was always willing to work with the students  especially if they weren't doing well. If you show up to class  and you have decent writing ability  you'll be fine. If you can't write  avoid the class. He was also very clear about what he would ask on his exams. If you do the work  you'll get an A.
4.5,Had a great time in his class. Seems to take students ideas very seriously...sometimes more seriously than his own. But he wont let bad writing or ideas slide. Good sense of humor and always manages to bring a personal understanding to the text.

4.5,He's smart and he's funny. It sounds like his undergraduates don't like him  but we have a pretty good time in the grad class. He'll legitimately care about your interpretation and he'll make you think.
1,boring class  boring reading material
5,very easy going but completely resistant to the **** and spin - which is why some people have a problem with him.
1.5,Very unfair grader and very aloof  class was a joke but he didn't grade that way. Definitely look for a better professor
1,He is a very immature guy. He believes he is always right even when he is not. I've had to schedule with him  but believes it is my fault even though I gave him at least two weeks notice. He treats students as kids and not as adults.
2,He always went over the scheduled end time. If you didn't have word for word answers on the exam  you would not receive full credit. The subject was boring to begin with  and he made the class even more boring. Not very professional. Only plus  he never made you do busy work  everything had a purpose.
1.5,Hard grader  uninteresting lectures
3.5,Kurt is a great guy. Most 3030 labs will be in the optics room and will take some time to complete. It's best not to procrastinate in case you have questions (he has office hours  but welcomes walk-ins). Book is a must and you have to have high discipline. Hard grader  but he is just giving an honest rating of how much you really understand.
5,Hard test grader  but he wants you to know as much as possible.
1,Kurt is a very boring lecturer. He does a lot of talking about advanced geology and his research  but forgets that this is an introductory geology and we don't really know all that much about it. He likes to put up pictures and explain them in complex details before we even understand the words he says.
3,As a person he's a lot of fun but pretty hard grader. Lectures are boring and not quite consistent  exams don't seem to be super difficult but even if you gave a correct answer to question  you still can get much less points than expected. Would not recommend THIS.
5,His class is difficult  but as long as you study and go to class it's really not that bad. The lab TA is very helpful too. Panter cares about the class and really enjoys talking about rocks. He is easy to understand. I hated the class. It's boring. Rocks are not my thing. But it's definably doable as long as you give it a chance and study.
1.5,This is one of the worst classes I have ever taken. His tests are ridiculously difficult. My grad student for my lab was foreign and was incomprehensible and couldn't understand half of the questions we asked. He asserted that over half the class failed the first exam bc we didn't study enough... RUN AWAY!!!!
2,Run away
5,Dr. Panter is great! Very smart  super nice. Tough class  but it's worth it because he's an awesome prof!
2,Run away!
3,Kurt seems like a real nice guy. Class can be boring...you have to prepare for the tests if you want a good grade...offers extra credit each week...does not take attendance so if you miss a class  no big deal. Overall  good/easy class.

5,He is very interesting.his study guides are what is on the test. His tests are mostly from notes! not multiple choice tests. all full-in and essay. NOT BAD THOUGH.know the study guide your in good shape.offers A LOT of extra credit.i recommend him!

5,I took him for 2 semesters of Hebrew and he was one of the greatest professors I ever had.
4,Great Hebrew Prof. Jokes aren't that great  but nice helpful guy
3.5,Kerstein is a nice old man with impeccable hebrew pronunciation. He's old-fashioned but (usually) in a charming way and will not teach you 'current' hebrew. The textbook is fantastic (ha'yesod) even though he jumps around in it. worth taking if you're interested in hebrew - he's not the best but he ain't too bad either.
5,AMAZING!!! i love this professor he is so much fun  helpful and easy. you really gonna learn hebrew with him in the fun way!
4.5,I took all three of his classes. They are pretty difficult... however he is VERY helpful and will even help you with the questions during the test (sometimes gives answers). I would recomend him to anyone!
3.5,Does not curve  and he makes you study  and know all the voc. aks que. every lesson. Also  you will learn hebrew  but it's a lot of work. Not easy  but fair
4,He is a very nice professor and a nice person. He is fair. He really makes you learn. I did not know hebrew at all and now i can speak  understand a little  read and write! It is not easy at all but if you want to learn  he is there for you. If you ask questions on the tests  he gives you answers!
4.5,If you know a little hebrew than you wont have a problam. If you dont know anything its not terribly hard  but youll have to work. Overall he is a very nice guy. You have no choice if you take hebrew because hes the only teacher (which is not such a bad thing)
4,Very nice and helpful. Easy class for someone who knows a little hebrew!
4,no choice if you want hebrew. He is the only hebrew language professor. Anything you don't know on the tests  just ask. He will tell you straight out. one time i asked an answer straight  he told me the answer  the 2 before  and the 2 after without my asking.
4,very funny :)

4.5,It's easy if you know a little Hebrew. Do all the hw and study for the simple vocab quizzes. IMPORTANT--Go to ALL 14 hours of lab whether he stresses it or not! He told us about it halfway into the sem. I went to 6 hrs of lab and got a B instead of an A.
4.5,You can't go wrong with this professor. He has a genuine interest in helping you learn the material and is flexible.
4.5,He is very nice. His class was fun also. His tone is a lil monotone but all in all a great professor.
5,Very humble  but very funny and full of wit. He is very knowledgeable and wants everyone to do well and actually learn. He is highly recommended.
5,Alvin is incredible! Please take him anytime you can!
2.5,BORING!!!r He was mumbling something for several classes and then students were doing the presentations...r did not teach anything in class but the final was Hard and from the book...
4.5,I had him for small groups. What a great guy but boy is he boring as I don't know what. He means well but you just want to pull the words out of his mouth it take him so long to say them. I got an A-. He only gives a final and two easy papers.
4.5,The class is fun...but lately he has decided to give a final. Pay attention because this is VERY important. The final is SERIOUS. Read the book. Or at least the chapters that he tells you to. If you want a good grade you need to do well on the final. I was running an A- in teh class and after the final ended witha B+.
5,Professor Snadowsky is a wonderful professor with many years of expierence. He makes the class fun by getting everyone involved in the learning process. I love him and I too wish he taught more courses. He wants everyone to do well  but don't take my word for it..register for the class
4,Do not take the final exam lightly for you really have to read the book.
5,A sweetheart and great professor. I wish he taught more classes for I'd register for them all. Definitely take this class for its a fun and memorable experience. No tests  2 papers basically about yourself. It should be considered an education course as well as a psych for you have to basically do a lesson plan and teach the class.
1.5,EASY CLASS but boring
5,I adore him  he is the nicest  sweetest  old man alive. His class is great  all the presentations so far are interesting and fun. Like everyone else says  an easy and enjoyable class. Lots of chocolate and arts and crafts involved.
5,class is fun  we played games the whole time  super easy A  but when he talks he is so boring it's almost unbearable. I got an A but I don't feel like I learned anything. Nice old guy.
5,Nicest sweetest man. A's to ALL students!!
5,The easiest teacher you will ever have.Everything that he repeats 3 times is a test question.You have to do an oral report which sucks.But ooverall an easy A.You can be braindead and pass!
5,THis professor is the best. he wnat you to pass witha good grade. Just seeing his enthusiam at his age makes you smile. he loves what he does. Not a difficult class. Easy A. You eat alot of Candy in this class. Discussions are really meaningful
5,The best professor I have ever taken. He is funny  knows his subject. If you want to get a nice grade  you have to take him if you get a chance. He is the best.
5,This professor is great. this class only involves teaching the class for a day and writing two papers. Very easy and fun  just watching him teach makes you smile. You will have a blast
5,Too Easy! Just copy his notes word for word as he repeats each sentence like 3 times. It's as if he gives you the exams! It's mostly straight out of these notes that he uses every semester. There's a short presentation along with a 5 page paper. Easy A.
1,Laziest professor I have ever met. Attendance not mandatory just have to read the book  his book  and THE WHOLE THING front to back. He tells you what he says in class is not important because its in the book. READ  know the terms and he'll give you everyone the same grade  a b+
3,nice guy but boring  notes are useless just read the textbook or the summary at the end of the chapter if your lazy like me. tests are onfusing but gives a nice curve. when i seen i got a A- i was really happy.gives you an optional paper but its long and woud of been a waste of time for me
2.5,ok so attendence not manditory notes not worth much  def mostly all about the txt book. 3 tests and optional paper  tests with LONG questions and are confusing  after the 1st test u see what 2 expect but def confusing q's. NICE GUY but SO BORING  & goes on tangents. I got a B+  im content cause his tests were confusing! read the txtbook!! good luck
3.5,He is the nicest old guy he really is--but I got a B- in the class--my lowest grade =( His quizzes are the trickiest things in the WORLD-notes r completely useless-he expects u to MEMORIZE everythinggg in the chapter n will pull out random stuff that you'd never expect to see. The final was unbelievably hard 2. Nice guy but it's up to you honestly.
1,this guy didnt even bother showing up to the final exam. That shows how much he really cares about what happens on his final. He may have been good but its time to retire rather then pretend to be teaching. 100 tricky questions on the final exam is not enjoyable. Not showing up for the final cause of little rain is pathetic. Avoid him.
1,Most boring class i ever had  I never thought it's possible to fall asleep while making notes...and notes are not so helpfull  you better read al chapters twice with notes then you'll be more or less fine. Questions are very tricky. Try to avoid this class.
2.5,dont even bother going to class  EVERYTHING is in the book  gives 5 quizes and drops the lowest  read the chapters instead of going to class and youll get an A
5,Excellent professor. Everything is straight from the book and you need not attend the classes. The class time gives excellent insight into understanding what is going on and if you choose not to go  it's your loss. Very easy exams.
5,The problem with BC students is that they DON'T STUDY!! McMahan is great!! He doesn't give surprises on exams as other professors do. Attend lecture  read the text (read to understand  not memorize)  and you'll be fine. We do read the entire book.. but as long as you keep up  there shouldn't be any problems. I highly recommend him.
3,Hard to understand his lecture...Exam are from book and his lecture speech...But you need to attend everyday and writes down everything to know what is on his exam. His lecture sometime confused you.
3,Interesting subject matter  but Very boring delivery. His exams are fair  straight from the text. He curves grades and gives you the opportunity for extra credit work to boost your grade. If you read the text  you can do well.
3.5,Very boring. Pretty easy grader though. Quizzes straight from book. Lectures straight from book. Get a good hour or so nap in his class.
5,Excellent prof. Explains everything extremely well  knows how to relate simple examples to complicated topics. Gives easy tests and no HWs. As long as you read and take class notes you have nothing to worry about. Highly recommend this teacher.
5,He's a good prof.U don't have to go to class  but just read thru the books for all quizes  and do the online practice.Lectures are very helpful for exams if you take notes.He doesn't care about the attendence. No homework for his class only one optional term paper.He's a fair grader only base on exa
5,If you do the reading  you will do fine on his quiz.
4,gives u 5 quizes  drops one. u dont have to come to class to learn the material  everything is straight out of the book. not such a hard class.
1,confuses everything  although information is directly from the book. Drops lowest quiz  but they carry heavy weight in terms of your final grade!!
5,Great teacher. Easy class  usefull info...rock on McMahan
5,Great Professor. Info was clear  in order and insightful. Very easy to learn from. Gives several difficult multiple-choice quizes and drops lowest so you get several chances instead of everything riding on midterm and final. Really nice guy.
2,crazy man
1,The hardest easy A you will ever get. Sitting through this class is absolute torture. I do not understand how someone who does so little can still be a professor. Do NOT take his class. The A is not worth it.2
2,If you're looking for an A  this was an easy class. But that's also because we had almost NO assignments  there were times he didn't show up  & material was irrelevant. He's a nice dude and clearly smart  but he doesn't care about undergrads and taught us -literally- nothing. If you actually want to know urban soc  do NOT take the class with him.
3,I was very uneasy as to how grading will be and I cannot lie  waiting for my grade made me very anxious. As a professor  def not the best. As an advisor  he is phenomenal and keeps things real. Unless you're ready to be fully engaged I would avoid taking him but he is great to talk to!
1,you will be lost the entire semester. he is a nice guy but is not clear about ANYTHING! we didn't know about our final exam until the week before. there is not a lot of work for the class  no textbook but this class was a headache he was not helpful AT ALL. no syllabus  nothing.
1,No. Just no. He should not be a professor. He is so clueless to everything that is going around. His lectures are boring and has nothing to do with the class. Okay its called race and ethnicity.. but we only focused on black people.. this class was tortuous
1,This guy has no idea what's going on. Half the time he doesn't know what day it is. He accidentally gave our midterm to the wrong class. His lectures are pointless and you will learn nothing. 10/10 would not take again.
1,I would rather die a slow and painful death than ever take any class taught by this guy ever again.
1.5,Jumps around in lessons  the point at the end of it is unknown  has a syllabus but there's no order to it  has difficulties with communication no real review for exams. Just read the book and memorize all the theories. We had to use two books. One was a textbook on terms other on examples
2,Boring. There is little structure to the class and he doesn't always stick to the syllabus. The midterm is relatively easy  there are a couple of debates and papers but I didn't get much out of the class  you pretty much teach yourself with the information from the book. It's hard to understand the points he wants to make.
2.5,boring class. never knew what he was talking about most of the time. the book is not a must. he is good at teaching  he would be better if he gave some sort of outline for what he was teaching.
2.5,Can be interesting if you enjoy the topics. The lectures can be long and boring. The class itself seems easy but beware he is a tough grader. Thought I did well for the class but ended up with less.
3,Great Professor  great knowledge of subject. Highly recommend this class. Very little use of text- lots of articles to read on line. Can be a little vague as to what he wants from students. Midterm  Final  and Group Project.
3,very very very nice man. VERY boring class him being so laid back didnt help much. if yu arent interested it gets boring. tests..um theyre ok. i didnt open a book. never paid attention in class. and passed with a B.idk if i wuld recommend. but hes very nice and is willing to help
4.5,Prof. Green has a lot of information to share. You have to be self motivated in his class because he is very laid back but grades hard. Still I think he is a good professor for those interested in the field. I am definitely taking other classes he offers.
2,You will not learn anything from this teacher. He can not clearly explain a concept or stay on track with a thought. He can not engage the class and he will tell you to prepare for exams in one form and then change it without explaining. His test are not fair and will ask questions which are opinion based then mark it wrong.
4,He is a wonderful and very intelligent man. He knows the subject very well. Some people do tend to get lost though because of the way he explains things. He might be too smart.
2.5,It was my favorite subject - I never skipped a single class  read notes and textbook  did my assignments and always visited his office. The only patterned grade I got throughout the semester was C+. If I didn't do all of the above I wonder if I would end up with anything higher. Sometimes it's hard to understand what exactly he wants from you.
1.5,I had him last year. He wasn't my favorite for sure. I find his class boring. He was mostly absent.In his class I was confused to want he talking about although I did read the book.For me he lack a lot to be a professor. But that's my opinion.
4.5,I became addicted to this class: subjects of discussions are very interesting  a few written assignments  most of the grade depends on your performance on the mid-term and final (about 35% each) and two essays. He is very nice toward his students and will take in consideration your effort and dedication to his class so your final grade raises
4.5,I have never thought of sociology as of subject of my interest. Since I started attending his class it seemed that this semester flew in one second. Bottom line: class is awesome  written assignments aren't hard at all  rather intriguing and challenging in a positive way. It is not likely that you regret if you take it.
1,Had him for Intro to personality. His lectures are unclear. He goes off topic a lot. It was hard to grasp much in his class
1,I've had some terrible teachers  but he definitely made it to the top of the list. I haven't learned anything about the actual course  but can tell you anything there is to know about his personal life and family. DO NOT TAKE. I repeat DO NOT TAKE unless you want to have a terrible semester.
1,He can't teach. The first 3 times I was there  I realized that he only talks about his life and that's it. Then the 4 other times I was there was to find out when we will take the exam. Uh  well we were very behind so he gave everyone a 90 on the second exam  dropping the lowest grade of the two. Easy A  but you won't learn a thing. Just stay away.
2,Want a ancient professor whose lectures aren't coherent and so boring they make you want to rip your eyes out? Then this Hungarian psychologist called Erdelyi is your guy! You don't learn squat in his class. He doesn't take attendance. He gives 2 midterms and a final. Other than that  he's a really nice guy. He's probably suffering from amnesia.
1,I took him my first semester and all i remember is that he has an asian wife who he spoke of most of the time and joked that its good that he has tenure. I gave him a 5 for difficulty bc I was totally unprepared for the tests because he didn't teach. He even yelled at me once because i asked to many questions  actually yelled bc i showed interest
1,DO NOT TAKE HIM! He does not speak about psychology of personality. He speaks mostly on Statistics but what does stats have to do with this class? He keeps on repeating what he says and stays on one chapter almost for a month. His textbook does not make sense as well. Terrible professor.
1,We're not even 6 weeks into school and I'm dropping this course. This is the only time I have ever needed to drop a course mid semester. He is an absolute idiot  never stays on topic  and repeats EVERYTHING 15 times over. DO NOT TAKE HIM YOU WILL REGRET IT. He needs to be fired stat.
3,He likes to go on and on about his whole lifestory. Do not expect him to stay on topic. Most of the things you learn in this class will be from the textbook  not from him. He only took attendance 3 times so a lot of people skipped many of his classes and just did the readings. But he didn't assign any papers or homework. Other than that  he's nice.
3.5,He's a very nice and lenient Professor. He does tend to go off topic during lectures. Unfortunately we didn't get to finish all the chapts and topics during my Fall 14' semester. Honestly I just think he's getting old but he's not a BAD Professor. Although he only took attendance SOMEtimes it's best to show up to know what will be on tests. No Hw.
1,I'm a junior and a I took him during my first semester at BC. His class is still the only class in my LIFE that I've gotten a C in. His exams have nothing to do with the textbook  and his lectures are not coherent. I'm writing this review because I want to make sure other students don't make the same mistake I did. DON'T TAKE HIM!
2,very unclear  long rambling lectures very self-centered man  lectures were 50% about himself and 50% about the material test questions had some surprises  content that you can be sure was never covered in class he is sadly nearly tenured
1,Prof. Erdelyi's class was horrible! Not only did I get NOTHING out of his class  but it was the first class I got a C in! I've always received a B or an A in a psyc class! He gets off topic in a heartbeat  so you end up LOST! Hes so DISORGANIZED  some people should not be allowed to teach! PLEASE do not take him  or you'll regret it as I have now!
1,If you have barely any interest in the subject of psychology  i fully recommend taking his class for you will pass. He took most of the time in class to talk about his personal life. Barley uses the textbook. Two tests plus a final. Drops the lowest grade. He was so behind on teaching us  that he gave every student a 90 for the second exam.
1,Run away fast don't take this class
2,eaaaasy grade! just show up  didnt need to pay attention half of the time  never used the textbook and still passed  only 2 tests & lowest score is dropped. very much a story telling teacher mostly about his personal life and random things going on in class.
1,DO NOT TAKE!!!!!!!!!!
1,He's all over the place  you leave most classes feeling like you didn't learn anything at all. Since attendance isn't mandatory it makes you not want to waste your time and stay home  he's nice though so not a tough grader.
2.5,Needs to stick to specific topic more
2.5,Needs to stick to topic more
3,Really confusing and slow. Often goes on random or semi-random tangents. The class progresses really slowly as he randomly comments on students who say something  walk in late  or are just sitting minding their own business. I'd like to emphasize the slowness. It's November  and our 1st test was this past Monday. No assignments though.
4,Dr. Khanal knows what he's talking about  but he isn't always the clearest about expressing that. The assignments can have unclear directions a lot of the time. But for most of the labs  he'll walk you through exactly what you need to do.
1,Harihar Khanal is a nice guy and he knows math rather well. However  due to his accent it is hard to understand him very well and it is hard to learn from it. He does not respond to emails very quickly  and he loses some assignments if you turn them in outside of class. He tries to have a sense of humor but its more dad jokes really..
1,"Does not speak comprehensible English  you will not understand him he calls ""n"" yen and ""s"" yes and says yes after every word so when you need ""s"" he says yes yes making it impossible to understand. There are many other butcheries of the English language. He thinks himself hilarious and will laugh at his own jokes and no one understands what said."
1,I am a Junior with a 4.0GPA and he is the worst teacher I have ever had. He skips steps in processes  which makes everyone lost. Is never in his office during his office hours. Always late to class  and receiving text messages and phone calls. Puts homework on the syllabus  and never mentions it and expects it to be done. Don't take him!
2,horrible horrible
1,I wouldn't take him again. He's nice but that is really the only positive. Doesn't use a textbook or any type of supplementary material during class and he's very hard to understand. Comes up with his own examples to present material and the class is left guessing whether or not his work on the board is correct. Grading is very vague.
3.5,Tough class to pass. A little hard to understand him at first  but not after a few sessions. He makes some hilarious jokes in class! Dr. Khanal allows you to replace your lowest test grade with your final grade if higher  final multiple choice. Gives partial credit on everything. Quizzes are easy and test are kinda hard. Doesn't give extra credit.
4.5,This professor loves teaching and he doesn't complicate the class  if you don't understand he will teach you again and will consider your difficulties on the test  this is the kind of teachers who cares about your GPA and you learning  I would take another class professor. He earned his salary.
3.5,He's a good professor after you get used to him. It takes about the first week to get over his accent but if you can deal with that then you'll be fine in the class. He goes over all the material really well and gives good reviews for tests. Homework is fairly simple and he grades with lots of partial credit on tests. Overall he's pretty good.
3.5,He is cool professor.His course will have lots of project .Make sure you are good in MATLAB .He is an easy grader and his tests are very easy.I would suggest to take this professor
5,Very good teacher to have. Understandable and uses a lot of examples. Helps with homework and one of the best teachers I have had on campus.
4.5,Was very frustrated first week or so because of his accent  but you understand it over time. He makes the class easy to understand  helps on homeworks & quizzes  and gives a test review that basically comes from the test. Amazing teacher to take for calc!
4,Has a heavy indian accent. After the first week or so he becomes more understandable. Gives 10 hw assignements as part of the grade. He does a lot of examples on the board and relates problems to other classes  like Physics 1  or to real life situations. He is a great teacher  and I learned a lot.
4.5,Difficult to understand his accent at first  but it gets better. Gives homework about once a week  and helps you if you have problems the day it's due. Prepares sample tests very similar to the actual tests  which helps a lot.
4.5,One of the easiest teachers on campus. Very lenient & laid back. Very helpful when you go meet him in his office. Has 3 exams & a final but the final is optional so if you do well in the 1st exams & the homeworks you are good. If you did 2 exams bad  he replaces your final grade with 1 so that you can get a better grade. I recommend you take him.
4,Great teacher  sometimes hard to understsand. Loves teaching  extremely helpful if you go in his office hours and ask.
5,Great teacher!!! very helpful and very determined to help you pass expecially if your math background is not strong. he sticks by his office hours so visit him whenever you have a question. He has an easy-going kind of character. Word to the wise... make sure to brush up on your trig because your going to need it.
3,Very Enthusiastic about teaching however he doesnt allow the use of TI-83  89 for any of his exams.
5,easy teacher  great to work with  if you do the homework class will be easy! Take it from me im a C person in math  in calculus I have a A. Take him  he is worth it.
3.5,Very interesting professor  funny accent  can be funny at times. Homeworks are easy at first but gets harder towards the end. Drops the lowest quiz and hwks with the highest one.FINAL EXAM IS OPTIONAL!!!!!!Take him..you can just use the textbook from the library coz u only need it for hwks...saves u alot of money =)
4,Take note of EVERY WORD that comes out of his mouth. He WOULD test you on it. Also read the text because he would test you on that also. In all it's about 120 multiple choice questions in 2 hrs. He gives credit for good attendance also. Other than that - he is a nice professor  very fair and to the point  and the class is interesting.
3.5,If the tests weren't do so detailed  I would consider this class interesting and recommend it to others. The tests are very doable  but just know  a lot of questions involve subtle details  which can be easily forgotten. Getting a good grade is definitely possible  but just remember the tests are more annoying than they have to be.
3,lots of information... you don't want to miss a class because if you miss a note  you could miss 20 questions on the test!
4,Im taking him next semester for social psych..and masculinity..is that too much of brannon for one semester or will i survive?
4,Im not going to lie his tests werent easy  but if you went to class and took decent notes you should get a pretty good grade. The curve didnt help me much because I did good on the tests but if you do bad its a great help. I recommend him
5,brannon is the best psych teacher - he is clear  passionate  and extremely fair. do not take this class if you are scared of working
3.5,ok I don't know what anyone is talking about  this class is so boring and tedious  it's insane how much notes are given each and every class and how every single part of it is on the test  the test are really hard  and need a lot of memorizing  but there is a pretty big curve  but wayyyy too much notes every dayyy  cannot miss anythingg!
5,He's great  its not to exciting the class because he just sits there and lectures  but he's great and its easy to pass his class
3,Brannon is a boring teacher. You have to write down everything that he says  it will be on the test. what you read in the book is not discussed in class  and will be on the test. Although he is hard  he is a great teacher  who gives great curves. Take him!!!
4,This class was great-A LOT of notes every lecture was till the last minute of class and like 5 pgs of notes a day as long as you take good notes and study you can do SO well! He puts a HUGE curve on every test you can do really well! The tests are like over 100 m.c. q's and some Q's have like choices a-g but otherwise hes funny and its a good class
5,What a cool class. I had a few good laughs and learned some fun facts. He is way cool  exams are long  but nothing to stress over. There should be more professors like him.
3.5,The tests are long and include anything he may have mentioned in class and from the reading. In addition  each question has 6 to 9 choices. However  if sufficient notes are taken  this class is not hard at all. Fall asleep or miss a lecture and a few questions on the test are not answerable.
4,He gives a full hour and a half of lecture so be ready to take alot of notes. His 2 tests are 100 multiple choice so be ready to study. Good news is that he gives a great curve.
3.5,he might be boring btu take good notes and you will be fine. dont forget to read the book its very important his curve is huge and its very easy to get an a. but u do have to study in advance for it
3.5,crazy curve  a lot of notes but as long as you are a good note taker then you will do fine. i would definately recommend him. GREAT PROF.
5,Awesome!
4.5,Great teacher. You have to read your notes and and the book to do well on the 100 questions test-but the questions are pretty straightforward. Interesting class.
4.5,It's a very interesting class. There are a lot of notes though. The tests are over 100 questions  but he gives a great curve. He's a nice professor and gives pretty interesting lectures.
3.5,He gives two test during the semester. But the test is 100+ questions and sometimes he's questions are sometimes weird. He gives a lovely curve and you must attend all classes to get a decent grade in the class  and the lectures are not that bad. Besides he is the only 1 that teaches the course.
5,Prof. Brannon is very good. He gives 2 exams but they are very straight forward. The exams basically consists of class notes (be prepared to take a lot of notes) and some from the book. He gives a great curve. If you receive the highest grade on the midterm you don't have to take the final.Good prof
2,A pretty tough grader  and I'd say that if he agrees with what you're saying  you'll do well. Grading is subjective anyways  but he takes it to a new level. Personally  I didn't like him too much. The material was pretty interesting on the other hand. My TA this year was incredible though!
4,I liked Lecker. His lectures were very interesting and depending on your TA  the conferences can really help clarify things if need. He has really insightful things to say about what we read  he's very knowledgeable about the content&the authors and encourages people to give their own ideas in class. Have the readings done before class  its a must!
2,Do not recommend if you are not an ENGL major
3,Professor Lecker is someone who clearly knows what he is talking about from a professor's point of view. If you are not an English major you will find yourself being utterly confused and frustrated in this class. He isn't very approachable nor does he try to aid the student's understanding. When it comes to exams he is very vague.
3,really challenged me to reflect on what it means to hate people...
2.5,He knows his stuff... but not there for his students. Very distant professor and not very approachable. VERY harsh grader. Do not take if you are not an English major!
2,Mailing it in. An Abomination.
1,just not interested anymore  it's so obvious
2,Professor Lecker is an expert on Canadian Literature. He makes a real effort to help his students succeed. It's not at all an easy class and it really depends on the TAs that grade your exams. I enjoyed the class and would suggest it to friends. Remember it's not an easy A. You need to put in the work in order to do well.
1,I ended up having to use notes from other Canadian lit. classes just to understand what was going on in lecture. Disorganized  uninteresting lectures and a prof who won't listen to constructive criticism from students is a bad combo. AVOID AVOID AVOID.
2,Most boring& uninteresting  painfully suicidal class ever. Do not take if you like to think freely and interpret literature the way it is supposed to be-subjective. He wants you to think like him  so in the end you are only pleasing the prof. Zero motivation and interest to attend his class. Most people are bored to death
2.5,very boring class. pretends to want to get to know you  but he secretly wants you to think just like his interpretations. lectures are painful to get through.
4.5,"Lecker is awesome. Engage with him. Get to know him. Don't get so defensive about the supposed ""ego"" that everyone on here is talking about  and just let him open your eyes a little - you might like what you see  you might not  but either way  taking his class is essential for learning how to talk about art."
1,Fairly unintelligent  and narcissistic as the day is long. If you accidentally make him feel threatened your grade WILL suffer  as his grading method is entirely subjective
4.5,Has a true passion for Canadian Literature  and is one of the best professors to study under if you wish to learn more in that field. He gets you into a routine of writing constantly which is tough at times  but gets you engaged. A little intimidating to speak in front of sometimes in the lectures  but there are conferences and a discussion board.
4.5,He specifically sets up the assignments to make everyon arrive in class having done the readings  and to help people keep up and do well. It was tough having a mini paper due twice a week  but then we got to revise them and submit the month's worth all together for the grade. No midterm or final. He encourages discussion  and coming to his office.
1,Beyond useless
4.5,people that dont like Lecker do not apply themselves in class. He is BEYOND helpful - always encourages students to see him in office hours. He encourages participation which makes the class more interesting. Take a class with him. Great prof.
1.5,He picks favorites and if you're not on his good side  or you don't agree with his ideas  he makes you pay. I have never had an issue with a professor but he is AWFUL. Trust me  stay away!
5,Prof. Lecker changed my life perspective  made me a better writer  and helped me find a career: all in one course. I found him to be a fascinating lecturer - although the course I took with him was a conference of 20  not a lecture. He was always very interested in his students and visiting him at office hours is great. He is challenging & awesome.
3.5,She is the cutest  funniest  most dramatic professor ever. The information she presents is organized and she always allows for some extra credit.
3.5,Class was interesting. Sometimes we went off topic but we usually went back on. 3 tests and they are not soo easy. I didnt do so well but that may be partially my fault. Her tests are vert hard and wordy. She doesnt give extra credit if you need it. Good luck!
1,One of the worst professors in terms of relaying course content. All she does is talk about her family  friends  and celebrities she met. She is totally disorganised and always strays from the topic. To actually learn something from this class  I would suggest that you NOT take her!!!
5,Hands down  the best professor i've ever had in brooklyn college! She is hysterically funny  and makes class soooo much fun. Take her before she leaves Brooklyn College!!!
5,she is great all around very efficient
4.5,she is a nice professor her tests are a few questions but you have to do the work so it can take some time. she gives quizes b4 tests that you never get back in time same for her tests. she allows a cheat sheet .try to get tahell for lab b/c natasha basically teaches everything sarah did which wasn't helpful. gives hw every monday. i recommend her.
4.5,EXCELLENT PROFESSOR. She's funny  intelligent  and very clear in her expectations. DO NOT miss class or lab  you will regret it! The class moves quickly and isn't easy  but she's very thorough. Read the book  do homework  and study... go for tutoring in Learning Center if you need it. Do exactly as she says  and you will do fine.
3,how are her exams? what is the format of the class? how is her grading?
3,she goes off on a tangent and doesnt teach half of what she planned. plus she takes forever to grade our papers.
3.5,She doesn't seem to know everything she is teaching (only focuses on what she likes but not on the whole subject). Not too bad overall though.
5,No Comments
5,I recommend anyone who has to take stats should make sure they take with her. she explains everything so well and makes sure everyone understands the material. very upbeat and refreshing which helps for a stats class- especially at night!
5,"Sarah IS the BEST teacher!!!!That is by far the best class I've had at Brooklyn College! Not only is she fun  she's passionate about her work and i never wanted to miss class. She makes it easy for you to pass with a good grade. She's just too cool. I admire her a great deal. She acts like she ""owns the place"" cause she's confident."
3.5,Good Prof.
5,excellent prof. upbeat  optimistic  and explains the not so easy material  very clearly. She makes this class enjoyable and fun which is a real feat. Also  she does not have to prove that she is superior  like some other professors have to.would highly reccommend her.
4.5,thanks Professor. I enjoyed your class.
2,No Comments
4.5,good teacher  good class
5,Sarah is one of my best teacher cos she is so enthusiastic and covers so much interesting material.
5,I definitely agree- she's not the BEST teacher  but she is entertaining and the material is pretty intersting. Her appearcen/ clothing are great- but yea  what is going on with that couch blazer.... its looks like an old couch that she made into a jacket!!
5,The tests can be difficult  but he prepares you well via in class lectures. He keeps the lectures engaging by constantly sharing anecdotes and telling jokes. Attendance is only 4% of the grade  but if you don't come to class  be prepared to fail.
5,Consistent  organized  knowledgeable
4,Great professor! The key to getting a good grade in this class is really just paying attention to his lectures  taking good notes  and studying. He makes all the neuroscience material understandable with the way he explains things. He also always provides real-life examples relating to the lecture and they're enjoyable to listen to bc he's funny.
4,Very  very funny guy whose jokes go over heads day in and out. Knowledgeable and will engage with you if you ask thoughtful questions. Can be snarky though  doesnt seem to love having to teach. Tests are VERY text dependant dont dare think you can rely on slides. If you are interested in material  this guy can really help you get it but no easy A
5,he's one of the best professors at BC. Dr. K is very knowledgeable in the subject of Neuroscience. The lectures are kind of stale  but he has the best stories to tell which helps the material stick. He's also hilarious! Yes  his exams are difficult so you must keep up on your studying. Take him if you can!
5,One of the best things that happened in my life was having him as my professor  I feel bad that the semester has came to an end. He is brilliant
2,Lord have mercy!!
1,If you're a student who is horrible at taking exams or actually have a life and have to work in order to pay for college  do not take any course with Professor Kurylo. His class is 96% exams and 4% attendance. No extra credit  no project and no presentation. He does not care if you fail:(
5,I thought he was weird at first  but i grew to love his weirdness. I love his sarcasm. I only pay attention to catch the few sarcastic jokes he throws out. Good guy. Teaches clearly. He also makes funny faces without noticing. He's super interesting haha
5,Prof. Kurylo is not the typical college professor that just want you to memorize a bunch of stuff and then feed it back on a paper. He really expect you to think. On his test  it is more benefit for you to understand why rather than just study like a robot.
4,This is my third time taking one of Kurylo's classes and I am still very happy with his teaching and testing techniques. The test are fairly difficult but there is always a curve & as long as you are a good note taker you will be fine. Also  read the stories and diagrams in the textbook  almost always at least one question related to them on exam
4.5,He is awesome. grades are only tests. attendance is 4%  but i recommend you attend every class because he explains the information thoroughly. He gives out lecture notes a few days before the exam  memorize it and you'll do good. His tests are short answer  but some require only one word answers. He is soo funnnnyy i am def taking him again!
4,I took his class  and enjoyed it. He gave curves and I got a B without studying much. You really have to listen in class  and take notes. Very intelligent guy. He makes a few jokes which are missed by most of the class.
4,Extremely interesting class. Explains things well. Tests arent easy but he cuts a lot of slack int he grading. Your grade is just your tests  so if you dont do well on one tests  you'll get a bad grade on the course.
5,I took both physiological psych and human neuropsych with Prof Kurylo and both classes were amazing. He is very sarcastic which makes the learning fun. Pay attention in class  read the assigned chapters and you should do well. Smart guy  take him.
1,EXTREMELY HARD CLASS. this professor knows his stuff but really doesn't know how to teach. His class is extremely boring so its SUPER hard to pay attention and stay focused as much as u try. his tests are ridiculously hard no matter how much u study.i would really avoid taking his class.
4,Funny Professor. Kinda quirky  but he delivers the material in a way that its interesting. Short answer exams that are straight forward and he give you some slack on the answers. Would take him again!!!
2,Good luck if you have this professor - he is knowledgable but his class is so boring. I got an A  but by writing everything he said  even his boring stories because it will be on the test. Read the book because you will be teaching yourself. Only thing good about his class is that he curves the tests  because everyone fails. Do your best.
2.5,Take this class if you have really good vision cause he writes in like 10 font on the board  and if you like sleeping. Because that's what you'll be doing in this class. He's a really knowledgeable professor but he doesn't know how to put it into use and his voice makes most people sleepy. Tests are pretty hard too.
3,OMG I took intro to physiological psych and I hated the class SO much. I had a really HARD time trying to pass  EVERY SINGLE DETAIL THAT HE SPEAKS ABOUT IN CLASS IS IN THE TEST. Things that you would think wouldn't be on the the test are on the test. He is funny in a weird way and he knows his stuff but he can't teach and the class is SO DIFFICULT
3.5,Good teacher. No HW or quizzes  just exams. Exams were difficult but open book. If you show up to lecture every day and ask questions it shouldnt be too hard. Also his grading rubric is VERY generous
3.5,Delamater is incredibly knowledgeable and has a lot to say. This can work against him  however  because he will often go on and on about something that could have been said in 2 minutes. He is also disrespectful--making students feel embarrassed for saying the wrong thing  mocking students  rolling his eyes.
2.5,I dont recommend him! he doesn't know how to explain  no extra credit  no homework  no study guide  three exams extremely hard  you have to study on your own and read the book a few times to get the concepts well.
4.5,No extra credits  no extra assignments. 1 test and 1 final. Tests are hard but based on the book. So if you read you should do fine.
2.5,The professor knows the topic  however  he can't relay them well. He explains a topic in 5 minutes and you understand it. but then takes the remainder of the class over explaining it so that everyone is then totally lost. I wouldn't recommend taking him.
5,This professor really knows his stuff! Because he is really knowledgeable in this area he sometimes forgets that his students may not be so you need to ask him to explain in a different way. He also tries to explain the theories using lots of examples and dumbs things down so everyone gets it. Exams are hard and require work but he is a great.
3,I do not recommend this professor at all.His exams is unfair and does no show interest in students  however the lab section is great. Brianna Young the lab assistant is great.
4.5,I highly recommend him!His lectures were crystal clear and based on the book. He always gave examples to support the theories he discussed and his exams were fair
5,The material is challenging but Delameter knows his stuff. Never had any problems asking him questions. He gets a bad rap I suspect  because most people around here don't want to put in the effort. They'd be screwed at other schools. Attend class  study  ask questions. The class was interesting and he was super cool.
1,If you want to waste money  If you really don't care about your GPA  If you want to struggle  If you are interested in 3 hours of boring lectures than this class is for you!! ENOUGH SAID!!!
1,HE MAKES THE CLASS HARDER THAN IT ACTUAL SHOULD BE. THERE'S JUST A MIDTERM AND A FINAL(WHICH ARE BOTH SO HARD). HE DOESN'T ALLOW ANY EATING IN HIS CLASS AND IF HE SEES YOU EATING GET READY TO WALK OUT THE ROOM  THROW IT OUT  OR PUT IT AWAY). IF YOU ASK A QUESTION AND HE FEELS IT IS STUPID OH MAN HE WILL MAKE SURE TO TELL YOU THAT.
4,this is a very hard class  but if you do not follow than you are in trouble...the learning theory is no joke and Dr. Delamater knows his stuff. if you go to his office hours  he well help you out. if you want a challange take his class..its not always about A's!
1.5,this is a joke!!! why is he still teaching!! knows his stuff but does not know how to teach!!! no mercy Run!!!!!!
3,He really does curse alot to grab the students attn. There are 3 exams(no extra credit Attendance doesn't matter) On the first day of class he said an A=86-100  B=76-85 C=60-75 D=45-59 and anything below is an F. In the past most students got Ds or Fs. I hope he was joking.
2,Terrible professor. Insults students in class  makes students look stupid if they dont know an answer. would not recomend!
4.5,Amazing professor! Very interesting material. I learned a lot  I highly recommend his graduate class
2,This professor is really bady. I loved the course itself but did not enjoy his teaching at all. He can be very rude and does not give of his time to students.
1,Very boring lecture. He has to curse a lot to get the students' attention. A good professor does not have to do that.
3,Professor Delamater is great! He is very tough but he makes you work hard and you learn a lot. This is not an easy A class  but if you think you are smart enough to read a book  you will have no problems.
2,Lectures are boring and information is unclear. He is very unprofessional and treats you like an idiot if you are not understanding the info. He plays favorites and ignores the students who have difficulty in class.
1,THIS PROFESSOR IS TERRIBLE. TERRIBLE. TERRIBLE. AVOID AT ALL COSTS  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. THIS PROFESSOR GIVES 3 EXAMS WHICH ARE MULTIPLE CHOICE BUT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. EXTREMELY. IT GETS BETTER THOUGH... THE FINAL IS 100 MC QUESTIONS WHICH IS CUMULATIVE FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE SEMESTER. SAVE YOUR GPA  TAKE THIS WITH SOMEONE ELSE!!!
1,THIS PROFESSOR IS TERRIBLE. TERRIBLE. TERRIBLE. TERRIBLE. AVOID AT ALL COSTS  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. THIS PROFESSOR GIVES 3 EXAMS WHICH ARE MULTIPLE CHOICE BUT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. EXTREMELY. IT GETS BETTER THOUGH... THE FINAL IS 100 MULTIPLE QUESTIONS WHICH IS CUMULATIVE FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE SEMESTER. SAVE YOUR GPA  TAKE THIS WITH SOMEONE ELSE
5,great professor
3,Long lectures  funny  no homework
3,Your grade is divided into 3 tests and 1 final exam. All are based on the textbook  yet lectures are just simplified coverage of the textbook. If you aren't actively reading the textbook the whole semester (like I did)  you'll have a very tough time with the tests. Very knowledgeable  but should be avoided for the sake of your GPA.
3,Long  long lectures....
2,He is very knowledgeable in this subject  however he has a hard time passing that on to his students. I am currently sitting in this class completely lost :(
2,He reads his slides and posts them on cuny blackboard. He gets his slides from the textbook but  do not miss his class (especially first years) it really makes a difference going to his class no matter how boring he is.
2,Its very clear that he's knowledgeable about the subject but he's terrible at conveying that knowledge to his students. Lectures are unclear  tests are tricky  his notes are useless for studying and overall  do not recommend.
1,His exams are incredibly specific and unless you start studying 2 weeks before the exam  do not expect higher than a 70 on any of his tests. I rewrote the entire textbook and went to the learning center to review for his class. I ended up getting an A but I worked for it. He knows his exams are hard though so he's a bit more lenient with the gradin
3,Overall he's an average professor. Gives good explanations. Requires a lot of textbook reading because his lectures are very vague. Tests are pretty tough but if you read the textbook you will pass.
2.5,READ THIS VERY CAREFULLY. DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND TAKE ANOTHER PSYCH CLASS BC HE'S THE ONLY ONE THAT GIVES 3600. HIS LECTURES HAVE EXCESSIVE INFORMATION AND ITS HARD TO KEEP UP IN CLASS . BEWARE OF CUMULATIVE FINAL  ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO PASS. LIKE I SAID  DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT TAKE HIM  IM WARNING YOU. YOUR GPA DIES.
2.5,Great guy  not so great lecturer.
1,If you dont have the best memory and have issues professors who say thats the text book now go read it DO NOT TAKE HIM. I have no doubt that he was once a good professor(just look at the amount journals he has published over the past decades and how his reviews have gotten worse over time) Long story short if you take him be ready to read for hours
1,Horrible! Always late to class and lectures are not clear at all.
4.5,His lectures are great. He puts up detailed lecture notes on Blackboard. He does his best to help the students. Try to read the textbook (read the summary section at least). There are 3 exams and a final
2,Professor Abramov  where do I even begin. His notes are confusing and his tests are extremely hard. He comes into class  talks for 75 minutes and then you leave and have to read the textbook front to back. The final was 15 chapters. He should retire  expect to self teach yourself everything. He is too difficult for an introduction course.
2.5,If you want to be happy. Then don't take him. He's a nice man  but it's basically an independent-study. His tests weren't even in English.
3.5,Abramov was great! He was easy to understand  his lectures were easy to keep up with  and he's hilarious. Read the chapter before class and you'll do great. Only 3 tests  no midterm  and they are multiple choice  50 questions. Taking the final on Monday  fairly confident. READ the chapters (textbooks in the reserves)  and participate  you'll pass!
3,He really knows what he is talking about but  his lessons are more than boring  his review is going back through the slides we've already seen  and there isn't any new information he gives you in review. His tests are extremely hard and specific. Great man. Terrible professor.
3,Very easy going and helpful. Great teacher  I learned so much from him.
3,Very unprofessional and takes the internet way to seriously. He needs to focus on being a teacher rather than getting butt-hurt over someones opinion
3,Knew what he was talking about  but didn't understand the wording on some of his test questions: I had the whole class on my side after explaining a question and listening to his reason for his answer  but he would not listen. He marked me wrong for a question that everyone knows I got right  he just doesn't understand the meanings of some words.
5,Macko is an awesome teacher.
5,MACKO IS THE MAN
4.5,This guy really knew what he was talking about. Great teacher and good guy to help you out. If you get him as a teacher  pay attention  and you will do fine. but prepare to watch him fly as he demonstrates camber roll.
5,He's such a gen. He genuinely cares that you understand. He'all answer any questions. There's some homework but it's fair and the lab helps you do it. He's great really. He knows what he's doing  gives reviews.
3,Wouldnt retake this class with him. Hes good at teachin but for some reason some of the concepts were presented too difficult to remember throughout the course. He does allow cheat sheets for exams but make them quick to understand b. c it can slow you down. Make sure cheat sheets have examples of steps for specific problems rather than definitions
5,Aaron Kozbelt knows his subject and he knows how to explain concepts. He is organized. His presentations are clear. Would have liked to have him for other courses. Some professors at brooklyn college should be watching him teach so they can brush up on their lecture skills.
5,Amazing angel of a professor. Dr. Kozbelt is an interesting professor  his lectures are clear and concise and he is very understanding and reasonable  even in a graduate level class. Take him!
5,Respected  organized and professional. He gives over hard concepts in a clear manner. It's a focused setting.
4,the class is HARD  you have to work for your grade. but he's hands down the best stats professor at Brooklyn college  take him !
3,He's an overall nice guy but this class is very stressful. If you aren't good at math you will struggle. It was hard to follow along and there aren't much tutoring hours. My TA doesn't help much and from what I heard  the other ones don't either. If you're feeling lost and it doesn't seem any better  DROP THE CLASS. He tried to help though.
5,Personally I think he is the best Professor in Brooklyn College. Simply not enough space to tell you all the good things about him. He really makes it easy to do well in a tough class. Show up to class and take notes  make sure you understand the material and you will do not just fine but get an A. If you want to understand Stats you must take him.
4.5,he is the best for statistics!!! 8 homework total super EAS Y if you go to class  three exams including the final and you are allow to bring cheats sheets for the three exams! also the final is very easy! TAKE HIM IF YOU WANT TO LEARN STATISTICS!
4.5,I have other Stats classes that I have taken to compare him to  and hands down I wish I would have had him first. He's one of the most understanding statistics professors I've ever had. Makes the lessons clear to understand  offers extra help in any way he can. The material is hard  but you leave understanding Statistics the way he teaches it.
5,Psych Stats is difficult  but having Professor Kozbelt alleviates some of the challenge. I love that he is VERY fair  VERY helpful & clear ! He is organized  knows what he is doing and makes everyone in the class feel like they can ask questions. Sitting in a lecture hall I was surprised when he remembered my name! Kozbelt is very professional!
5,Every professor should be like Professor Kozbelt. He was  hands down  my favorite teacher in college. I still miss his class one year later. Yes  stats is a challenging class  but for people going into this field and wishing to succeed  challenges need to be overcome. This teacher will fully equip you with what you need if you want to do well.
5,He makes statistics very understandable. The course does not have as much math as I feared  I suck at math and this class was my favorite. 8 hws which you need at least an hour for  weekly quizzes worth ~2% each 2 exams and a final. You'll regret not taking him he is THE best professor for psych stats and you'll learn a lot. Oh and he's a cutie.
5,Great Professor! Stats is not an easy class but he makes it very easy to learn and understandable. Just make sure to attend class and do the work and you'll get a good grade. He's also very willing to help. Reading the textbook is helpful but not necessary. He also allows cheat sheets on the exams!
5,I LOVE this man! Its impossible not to learn the material! He honestly puts every effort into making you understand the material in an easy way! He has such a sweet personality & is very understanding! Stats isn't too hard but you should put effort into LISTENING and reading your notes. Completely COMPLETELY recommend this professor. He's the best.
5,This professor is very understanding  patient and understands his material well. It is impossible for you not understand the material. With that said  this course is anything but a walk in the park. You need to buckle down and read the textbook like its got the meaning of life hidden in it somewhere.Beware  exams are a killer!!
5,Awesome proffesor. You have to work to get a A. Gives homeworks and quizzes every week but they are very helpful when it comes to the exams. Exams are tough but if you study and practice the hw and book problems then you have nothing to worry about.
5,He has a sweet personality. Loves teaching statistics. The course is VERY HARD but he teaches everything with clarity. The Quizzes and hw's help boost the grade. Totally recommended!
5,If you can't learn stats from this man  you should remove yourself from the gene pool. He's the nicest  most patient professor I've ever had. Explains everything and answers even the stupidest questions in a clear and humble manner.
4,Professors need to have a lot of knowledge and know how to teach and Kozbelt is very good with both. for psy 57 t/f quiz every week  helps keep things fresh for the tests. just take good notes  listen to how he outlines to course  and read the textbook. hes really smart and a good teacher.
1,this is by far the worst class i have ever taken in bc because of this teacher!!! a really interesting topic can truly be ruined by the teacher. the only way to do DECENTLY is to read all 15 chapters at least 3 times which is ipossible!! she is so unclear and talks about EVERYTHING other than the class subject! RUN!!!
1,omg a topic that i'm actually interested in happened 2 turn in2 the most boring thing ever.
2.5,very boring but easy as long as you read the book and know it well you will be fine forget about taking notes i got an a- and managed to enjoy most of the class
3,She has her favorites in her class which I don't think is right. Some of her lectures make no sense  but she is a very nice lady.
1,DON'T EVER TAKE THIS PROFESSOR...THIS IS THE WORST PROFESSOR AT BC!
2,I didn't enjoy her class  her tests are hard because she doesn't know how to teach. She goes off topic a lot and goes into irrevelent things because she thinks it's clear and helpful. My advice is to ask her for a review sheet  it helps a bit and lets you focus on what to study for. No curves  and difficult to get good grades in this class. Many Ds
1.5,Very nice and understanding woman but she's very difficult to learn from.
2,She is not the worst teacher  pretty boring  but her tests do not reflect anything from the class. I never missed a class and actually took notes  and also read most of the textbook but still did not do so well. If you do end up taking her  there's no point in going to class it doesn't help. Her tests are hard and hardly anyone gets an A.
1,awful teacher. you will not get an A in the class unless u can repeat the text's words in verbatim. worst teacher in the department  i hope she gets fired
3,In psy 20 She is extremely boring  my advice unkless you read the textbook before the semester began  give up  run  and find another teacher...For psy 57.1 she gives you the essay questions  just make sure each essay is at least 2.5-3 exam booklet pages long(back and front)
1,OH MY GOODNESS WHAT A BORE---She's such a nice lady that's why I feel horrible for saying this but she is UNDENIABLY BORING--she goes from A to D to Z and then back to B--It's extremely Difficult to STAY AWAKE
1,The lectures are boring and very unclear. Professor is very unclear about the information and is 'all over the place'. Exams are insanely weird and UNCLEAR! If you can take this class with a different professor  DO SO!
1,"I truely don't recommend her to ANYONE!! she is one horrible teacher to get. she is NOT helpful at all and almost everyone in class fails and she doesn't even give out Fs  but D- which is more terrible!!! DON""T EVER TAKE HER CLASSES!!!HORRIBLELY bad  unhelpful professor ever!!!!!!"
1,this is the worst prof i have taken both classes i took with her were difficult she is as far as i am concern an incompetent teaher. she never followed the book which was confusing she made it even worst. Please Please PLEASE DO NOT TAKE HER PLEASE
4,Nice professor but the exams are tricky. This class doesn't comprise of class notes  therefore you have to focus solely on the book (which is complex). She tries to help students boost their grade by adding an extra credit assignment. Hard class  I had to struggle to pass.
3,Very kind and understanding professor  but her teaching leaves a lot to be desired. It is almost IMPOSSIBLE to take notes  as the lectures are so random. The class was never really boring  but I never felt like I got much out of the class  either. If you take this professor  READ THE BOOK!
2,Boring professor with crazy hard multiple choice exams. No curve at all even though most of the class failed. Child psych can be a really interesting subject  but she makes it torture. Slept through all her classes  studied like an animal for the tests  and barely managed to pull off B's and C's.
2.5,A nice person and helpful but..class is really just for attendance/participation grade.Read the text because the tests require very detailed answers almost verbatem for a decent score. Strangest of all is you actually leave class more confused then you went in  so just stick to what the book says.
2.5,floater. The text is the teacher.
3,The class is pretty boring. Everyone walked away from both tests thinking they did well but the class average for both tests was in the 60s with the highest mark in the class only being in the 80s. Final was the same but longer. I lost some of my interest in the topic after taking the class.
4,He obviously knows his stuff  but his teaching methods don't really help. It's either only theory without showing how to apply to any problem  or he gives an example problem with a solution method that only works on that problem. I found that going to tutoring was a better way to learn the material. I would recommend him over some other teachers
4.5,"He's certainly not afraid to say what's on his mind. He speaks perfectly clearly. I got an A in the class and felt so good because of it. Apparently  it's not an easy class. The subject material is easy  but you absolutely must be prepared for the tests  as they are very thorough. I wouldn't say they are ""too hard"" though. They are fair."
4.5,His classes are work intensive  he takes the either learn the material  or fail the class approach.
4.5,Though the course is harder than most of the students head that go to that school  this teacher explains the subject almost as clear as it can be. Need office hour time  just go..he is always willing to help.
4.5,If you show up for extra help when it's offered at the end of every week  you'll do very well. Otherwise  be sure to study the hell out of the material. It's difficult work  make it easier for yourself by taking the help he offers.
4.5,No Comments

5,No Comments
4,took it in summer  physics is hard and he tries to make it as clear as he can. if you dont understand  ask questions. it's not something most people can just pick up  me included. he's helpful and funny too  good guy.
5,Best PS instructor I had at Riddle.
3,"HIS FAVORITE WORD IS ""CRAP"" WHICH IS KOOL"
4.5,Great professor. Very smart. He realizes that physics can be tough and will help you out pretty much anytime that he has free time.
3.5,Good teacher  though class can sometimes get a bit monotonous. If you need help with anything  he's always happy to answer and he also holds study sessions for tests. His tests don't throw random curveballs and are based on important concepts in physics.
4.5,"Hey  those who left a ""poor quality"" on Anz-Meador  seriously  if you want to become an engineer  you have to know your physics down to your brain. 1 hour in class you spend  spend atleast 4-5 hours extra. Those engineers who leave a poor quality in this professor it's obvious that you don't study"
4.5,makes pilot classes easy  hahahaha! engineers.
1,EXTREMELY UNORGANIZED  TO THE POINT THAT IT CREATES PROBLEMS FOR THE STUDENTS!!! VERY UN-HELPFUL AND EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND! AVOID THIS CLASS LIKE THE PLAGUE!
1.5,He doesn't know how to teach outside of engineering. Basic/Simple physics became extremely complex. He changes units at least 3-4 times a problem on tests and goes between metric and US units often. it's confusing.
4.5,Space Environment is a great class
2,He is an ok teacher but needs to be teaching the ENGINEERS  NOT THE PILOTS!!
2,Aarrggh!!! He is so fricking unbelievable. Decent guy but the bugger doesn't know how to teach. He makes physics sound like rocket science and makes ants at a picnic  the end of the world. I like his Texan accent though.
1.5,Insulting and condescending. Still got a B+ in his class.
1,Just dont do it....most of his class failed his test...highest grade was a C just drop it or take another teacher!
1,FOR THE LOVE OF GOD--STAY AWAY FROM THIS PROF!!
4.5,Dr. Pynadath did a great job teaching. The difficulty of his tests were such that his teaching exellence was required.
1,THIS CLASS SUCKS! DONT TAKE IT IF YOU DONT HAVE TO!!! he is very unclear (foriegn) and doesnt help with ANY problems. HIS TESTS ARE AWFULL... save yourselves now and take Church<(other chem teacher)
2,No Comments
2.5,He is a little hard to understand at first  but just make sure to do all the work he gives you. It may be a lot  but it guarantees you a decent grade. Sometimes his explanations aren't great  but you can look in the book if you're confused.
1,No Comments
2,He tries to cover way too much material at one time & he goes way too fast. He is very intelligent but he can't explain it in simple terms.
1.5,He already doesnt care about you.r Has all of the personailty traits we hater condesending  self-centered  pompousr r If you want a challenge be my guest.
2,He is one of the most arrogant individuals I've ever met. Has zero people skills and won't admit when he's wrong. If he realizes that he's wrong he'll just rip on you to deflect attention from himself.
2,quite possibly the most arrogant professor i have ever come across. don't screw up in front of him - he just loves to make you look stupid.
1,No Clear Enough. He seems not understand the lecture..
5,Professor Loparo is a really cool guy. Gives out extra credits when Indians won and going to class before holidays. The class material is hard but if you do the assigned homework  you will be fine. Quizzes are easy as long as you do the homework. Final is kind of hard but he curves.
1,Very fast lecturer and hard to understand. Will not slow down or help any student during class. Final was not representative of the quizzes throughout the year. Attendance dropped so low mediavision was added and extra credit given out to those who went to class. Avoid this class at all costs
1,The class is easy  you can learn by yourself without spending more money in this semester
1,The lecture is hard  unclear.
1,just soso
5,Extraordinarily smart  and knows his material. He's the department chair and rightfully so.
5,Loparo is easily one of the best professors at Case. His lectures are crystal clear  even when the material gets complicated. Tests are very difficult  but he does curve. Go to every class  it's worth it. Bonus for attending pre-holiday lectures.
5,Loparo is a great guy and a great professor. He talks and writes clearly and tells you what you need to know. Easily one of the best professors at CWRU. Tests and projects are difficult but he does curve the class. Oh yeah  he gives extra credit for the Browns winning and for going to class!!!!!!!
4,Even though he writes fast  but he speaks loud and *very* clear in class. He is a good professor.
5,I heart Loparo.
4.5,This class is pretty difficult and he does a LOT of intense mathematical derivation  sometimes without the basics or non-technical explanation of what's going on. He's very helpful outside of class though - and is a really  really nice guy.
5,totally excellent
4.5,Always gave help on coursework and excellent advice on my major(was my advisor)
5,Brilliant lectures. Goes fast but keeps it interesting
5,Best teacher in the Department
4.5,provides lots of information
3,If you want a good grade  plan on taking his class several times.
2.5,This guy's a genius  but is out of touch w/ the class. Lectures at light speed
5,Knows his Circuits
2,I'll try to be objective and critical  something that this professor is not. The most BS class I've ever taken. His lectures are tangental  without evidence and leaves you thinking that only 85% of what he said is true. His exam questions are his interpretations of the readings  not the author's actual points. Any answer could be correct.
1.5,he's a terrible lecturer  goes on tangents so often. he also sometimes confuses himself
1,Actually the worst professor I've had at Cornell -- I don't care if he is a brilliant researcher. He had no investment in the class  terrible lectures and had no care whatsoever what students took away from his class - truly terrible.
1,I remember that in the first lecture Prof. Hirschl was making his powerpoint slides in class. Yes  in class  while he was lecturing. His lectures were so random. He started off talking about the reading  made a few completely unrelated points  and he started criticizing some other sociologist  and then another sociologist  and then another.
2,"Hirschl's lectures are scattered  and his explanations of concepts are very vague. I did not know what ""developmental sociology"" was until our TA explained it halfway through the semester. He uses examples that are not thought out  and you could argue that all choices on his multiple choice questions are correct. Even so  the class is super easy."
3.5,First two readings were hard  rest was pretty easy. Actually pretty interesting.
4,Hirschl was an okay professor. Your success in the class really depends on the quality of your TA. If you have a bad TA who doesn't hand back assignments and doesn't cover all of the required material for the week because s/he runs out of time  then your grades will likely suffer. There are weekly assignments but the workload isn't too bad.
2,If you want to be constantly indoctrinated with socialst ideas  take this course. Hirschl legitimately spends most of his time in lecture pushing an agenda. It's infuriating when the garbage he's spewing is coming out of the mouth of a bumbling idiot. That said  this class is an absolute joke and if you have a functioning brain it's an easy A.
2,This class was useless but I took it for the easy A. Literally rarely came to class but came to all of the sections and did the readings. Take it for the diversity distribution requirement. You won't regret it.
2,Take it for the diversity credit and just get out with an A.
4,I actually learned a lot about things of social importance in this class and it opened my eyes to the world after taking only science classes prior to it. I hardly went to lecture  but the material was interesting and it was an easy A. In section we had one paper that wasn't even graded. Exams were somewhat tough but curved high
1.5,Prof Hirschl is awful. DSOC 1101 is awful. If you do the work  you will get a good grade  but the amount of work is obscene for such a stupid class. Hirschl tests you on his own material and his own views. I didnt know what sociology was until I looked it up three weeks into class. He makes you buy books for two chapters. AVOID if you enjoy sanit y
3.5,"If you try  you'll get a good grade. Hirschl hates economics and spends most of the time explaining his own views and supporting himself with questionable evidence. Whenever he uses scientific evidence as support  he looks foolish to the science majors. All correct answers on exams are variations of: ""Whites & men are oppressing blacks & women."""
5,These other ratings are bogus. This was one of the best classes I took at Cornell. Didn't learn too much  busy easy A  engaging lecture  and he's such a really nice guy. 2 prelims  final  section attendance  and discussion is all. Would def take again.
1,This is the worst class I've ever taken at Cornell. Hirschl hates economics as a science(and consequently economics majors like myself) and is the most boring lecturer ever. Even the books he chose were biased. (Perrucci and Wysong thought D.A.R.E was a conspiracy to distract the masses from social inequality) I got an A+ but didn't learn much.
5,I am an Applied Engineering Physics major and I had a 4.0 until I took Dsoc.I had to pull all-nighters every other day to keep up with the work.This class ruined my GPA but more importantly  my life.The triple integrals he puts on the exam are ridiculously hard to solve.Bring a graphing calculator to the exams and some extra batteries just in case
4.5,This guy is amazing  but if you become his friend  his class will become even more amazing and he will fascinate you to no end. He is a great person who knows a lot and is willing to share  but only if he likes you and you get to know him. So get to know him  and it will be a great experience. Class was pretty easy
1.5,If you are a legitimate student  this will be cake. It's so easy! But I hated myself for taking it. He is biased  and the worst thing was that the pre-med/science types couldn't even see through his garbage enough to be outraged. Unless you need a GPA boost badly  don't take this class- it was the worst one i've taken since middle school.
3.5,Really easy class and the topics are interesting  but he presents it in a way that doesn't really hold your interest. Don't really need to go to class to do well.
4.5,Easy class. Sweet professor. No studying necessary.
5,never attend and you will receive an A. Easiest professor I have ever taken  and one of the kindest.
4,Mind-blowing show up and pass class.
5,Dr. Scanlin is such a great guy. All he wants is for his students to pass his class and do great after graduation. You pretty much watch movies every other class and he rarely takes attendance. Before a test  he gives you loads of questions and the answers  you just have to memorize them. This class is a great GPA booster.
4,He really wants us to be educated and goes out of his way enormously to help his students. He's a great professor and a great advisor. Funny too. Take his class..
2.5,This was a very boring class - he would go off on long discussions about topics we couldn't care less about. Tests required memorizing answers to study guide questions - you certainly won't actually learn any of this stuff. Overall nice guy  though  and definitely loves what he teaches.
3.5,he GIVES you the test pretty much- he has outlines for every section he will go over. know these in and out cause they will be the short essays.
5,Geosystems. Great class but he changed the tests from mulitple choice to short essay tests. A bit harder than he used to be. But a GREAT guy and videos in class are pretty sweet.
4.5,Very funny guy and the class isn't bad either.
5,Dr. S is def awesome. He is so helpful with everything and is more than willing to go out of his way to help his students!
4.5,SO COOL. will help you out as much as he can and is very flexable. just dont be an ass and youll be ok. I LOVE THIS TEACHER
4.5,Dr S is so great! He is by far the coolest professor I've had so far. He really cares about his students and his Skeptics Manifesto class is awesome! So if you're an honors student--definitely take this course!
5,Take the Skeptic's Manifesto... not just because you want an easy grade (which it is)  but because you're interested... because you will learn a lot  get an A  and have an awesome professor (who somehow can relate anything to limestone)A+! hilarious prof
5,scanlin is the man it doesnt get cooler than him
3,well i must say scanlin is a nice guy. his awesome haircut & wonderful ways with words kept me entertained allll semester long. :)
5,i love scanlin  he's sooo nice and really cares about his students.
5,very knowledgable in topics other than rocks... no bush 2004
2.5,No Comments
4,not always clear  but alwasy entertaining and very sweet
4,a bit crazy and unclear  but very helpful and entertaining. Really nice guy
1.5,I had Jurs for my chem freshman seminar. The class was possibly the most pointless ever. Assignments were easy  but too much so. Grades are partially attendance-based  so go to the beginning of class  sign in  and get out of there when you find an excuse.
3.5,Jurs' lectures are beyond boring  but the information is important. I have nothing against Jurs  the CHEM 12 course was my problem
3,This class is the hardest one of the most boring classes you will take. The workload is alot when u have no idea wat your doing.. You skip around in the book until your confused as hell. I feel sorry for anyone taking chem 12. At least you have jurs
4,Dr. Jurs does what he is supposed to  he reviews and supplements what is in the text. He answers questions clearly when asked. It is about as interesting as chemistry can be made. The course is a lot of work  reading and problems. There is a lot of personal responsibility here. There are plenty of oppurtunites for a good grade just doing the work.
2,Terrible class  absolutely boring and poor lectures. Taught myself chemistry from the book because I couldn't take sitting through the lecture. If you have to take the first year chem lab  bless your soul.
3.5,This is a hard class but Dr. Jurs isn't a bad teacher. The information being taught is diffucult to understand as well as being a lot at one time.
4,Because chem 12 is a lecture class  the prof can seem unhelpful  but Dr. Jurs is very helpful if you approach him.
4.5,Definitely a better Chem lecturer. Knows what he's talking about and his lectures are worth attending. Notes and lectures are organized  clear  and well-developed. Not actually in his section but attended his lectures because Greenberg was awful. Jurs is a nice guy.
1.5,He was a terrible teacher. I know it's a general class required for most science majors but come on....try to make it a little interesting! I hated this class with a passion. Thank goodness I am done with it!
4.5,Chem 12 is chem 12  not very fun. He does his best  much better than any other prof you could have for the course. He tries to be cool  blows stuff up alot.
4,"Can be dry at times  but a nice guy overall. ""Wizard of Whitmore."" Can be funny. Great attitude. Knows what he's doing and teaches very well."
3,It is ok.
3.5,Good teacher  easy to follor. lots of demonstartions in class to keep your attention.
4,Overall good professor  but the class is alot of work and it's difficult to know him other than at the huge lectures
3,The average on the final was a 61. That's all I have to say.
5,He was awesome
3.5,Tough tests  but he was easy to follow in lectures.
2.5,not the most motivating guy in the world  but what can you expect in a class of 400?
1.5,I was really struggling in this course and he was very unwilling to help me.
4,A hard course  but a good prof.
4.5,The best English professor I have had here at Penn State. Classes are creative and stimulating. I always leave thinking how I can improve my writing style. Very encouraging and works more towards developing your writing style rather than merely a critique. Highly recommend.
4.5,Ryan is the best professor I've had so far. His class is very intellectually stimulating and very  very fun. We write essays with a focus on technique and style  not content. He made all of us better and more engaging writers. I wish I could take this class again...
5,If you have to take English 30  take Ryan. He is hilarious and the class discussions are so good. And any activity you do in class is creative and fun. He teaches you to be a good  non-textbooky type of writer. Best English teacher I have ever had. I was a better writer for sure once I left his class.
4.5,Ryan Stark may possibly be my favorite teacher of all time. He encourages you to actually think for yourself and explore your writing. He lets you do rewrites  but it's only to benefit your writing. Favorite class in college so far. I loved him!
4.5,highlight of my week. hilarious man who creates a fun atmosphere. easy A but more importantly  allows you to write about things that actually interest you. kids came even when the classes were optional.. great time  great teacher
4.5,Best professor. ever.
4.5,sweetest class ever  he's a mad nice teacher  you get to redo every paper he grades if you choose  only way to loose ur grade is if you don't go...so attendance isn't mandatory  but you should go if you want an A and not a B.....funny class in a weird way....but well worth anyone's time
4.5,very nice guy...weird at times but funny in a corny way. He lets you revise all your papers  so you basically get re-do's which will boost your grade. he is a very good teacher.
5,Really funny  makes you want to go to class. Sort of a tough grader but he lets you revise all of your papers so you have second chances  and he will be around to help you.
4,Ryan Stark... so many words for Ryan Stark. Take the class  ignore your first impression of him. I think he's a swell guy  although I've seen him like four times between 2 and 4 am wearing flannel. Super funny  surprisingly a difficult grader  but there's are revisions.
5,This teacher is smart and fun if a bit wacky. He'll keep you guessing which will keep you interested - something good for a subject that can be a bit dull. He encourages discussion and seems to actually care what his students have to say. Though you'll get off track a lot there will be a point somewhere - he's not just rambling about himself.
5,Greatest professor ever? Possibly
5,So awesome!
5,Ryan is great. He makes writing fun. And  he's so cute!
5,This was a senior seminar class that I was not excited about  but it wa awesome mainly because of Professor Stark.
4.5,He's awesome!
4.5,I love this man! He's quirky and makes class fun. Class discussions are often irrelevant but fun. the work load is the easiest ive ever had and its supposed to be an honors course. i love it!
5,very good
4.5,He's an awesome guy. Since you absolutely have to take ENG 015... take it with Ryan. Class discussions are interesting  there's not a lot of work  and he makes the class a lot less irritating than some other teachers.
4.5,Awesome  awesome.
1,This is a terrible professor who does not care about his students. His homework assignment instructions are vague and if you write a wrong code but has the same output he will show no mercy. He does not explain things well  but expects you to retain the information anyway. I do not know how he is still a professor here at SJSU. Worst experience.
2,The subject material and the professor's teaching style is boring but he does care about his students. There are only 5 homework assignments that add up to 30% of your grade. The rest is 1 midterm and 1 final. He curved both the midterm and final by 15% so many people were able to pass the class. You would have to try hard to fail his course.
4,While this subject can be a bit dry  all resources and lectures are posted online. It is an advanced course  with an applied version of SQL on the midterm and knowledge on terms with the final. Most of the class is structured so that while you have the resources  you learn how to actually apply the concepts.
1,Very boring lectures  professor lectures while most of class doesn't pay attention. Low attendance as semester goes on. If you have to take this class it is not hard as it consists of 4 Hw assignments plus 1 ec hw  2 midterms  1 finals  and easy group project. Do well on hw as it worth significant part of grade. Also you get page of notes on tests.
5,Mr. Shirani is one of the few teachers that gives out very helpful study guides so you know what to study for on the mid/final. 4-5 Homeworks assignments throughout the sem. no group projects. For mid/final study the study guide and in class exercise and you will do fine(write a good cheat sheet)You don't have too show up to class.
5,Lot of students wrote a negative review for saying that his lecture is dry but it's more like the topic is somewhat dry. The professor definitely goes above and beyond the textbook and teaches useful programs that are currently used in the MIS field. Really cares about his students & hw is challenging and makes you think. Gives generous extra crdit
5,Very dry lectures. Just show up and understand what he is saying. All assignment are tutorials on database. He is very easy going. 1 mid term 1 final . Very easy grader. Class is on PL/SQL basic like triggers  Big data database SAP hana and a little mongo db.
4.5,Extremely nice professor. Was not a bad class for how dry the material was. Allows one page of notes for exams. Would recommend him to others.
4.5,Dr. Shirani's exams are notorious for being difficult. They are based on conceptual understanding so studying the night before is not suggested. That said  if you are having trouble understanding he will help you during office hours or over email. He is one of the nicest professors you will have.
1,written guidance on projects unclear. Did not grade all of the parts of the projects submitted  even though they were mandatory for the project. Very little interaction with students post during course.
1,He is horrible. I should have gotten an A in his class  and he tanked my A at the very last second based on a group project that he only graded half of (he graded the word document  but not the required PowerPoint presentation). Beware  he is not a far professor
3,Remember to bring your laptop. You will watch over half the class surf Facebook during his lecture. This class is very important but its so boring. A lot of people say he's nice  but that's how he is to everybody until you cross him. He'll smile at you and tell you to read the book. A students will get Bs. good luck staying awake.
5,His zeal and compassion to better not only his students but anyone around him is unmatched. It was/is more than an honor to have him as a professor  coach  and approachable subject matter expert  hence I am without a doubt fully confident to recommend him as a genuine mentor and leader in MIS  Business intelligence and Database.
4,Dr. Shirani is a great professor. He is very supportive of students. You need the textbook and you need a clear understanding of the concepts. His questions go beyond understanding of terms. If you're lazy  do everyone a favor and drop the course. It's really rude to play games on your laptop during lecture. This is college.
3.5,Boring teacher  he reads off of power point slides monotonously for the lectures. 70% of your grade is based on two tests  which you will have no shot on if you don't study like you've never studied before. I liked the content of the class and you will gain valuable skills that will look great on your resume (oracle mostly).
4.5,Negative ratings for Prof Shirani are unjustified. He is extremely nice. He even have a huge curves on midterm & final. Lectures can be boring but if you pay attention the concept is crystal clear. NO PROJECT! Few HW assignment and that's it no quizzes. MIS Major  you don't have alternative choice. Just show up and decide for yourself.
1,"Shirani's a nice person but is a horrible professor. Super boring  not clear  ppl in class were so bored most of them were online chatting. U basically teach urself the material. since his poor teaching skills lead to poor grades  he gives huge curves which still only lead to mostly ""C's"" after the curve. i feel sorry for u if u take this with him."
4.5,Prof Shirani is by far the best professor I've had at SJSU. This is the first time I bother commenting on a professor because I feel that most of the comments here for Prof. Shirani aren't justifiable. He is always willing to help his students. Those that do not pass his class with a good grade probably didn't bother to try. The exams are significa
5,Dr. Shirani understands the field and illustrates his professionalism in class. Both the Midterm and Final are extremely challenging for being MCQ (tricky) yet are easy for he specifies the material to study. Though he has a passive personality  he CARES about students learning and is approachable. Read the book and practice SQL statements=PASS
1,He is the worst teacher I have ever taken at SJSU. There's only 1 midterm  a final  5 HW assign.  a lab  and that's it. Before the final  you only completed 65% of the class. Unfortunately he is the only person teaching this class. I learned nothing from him this semester. You're better off skipping class and learning the material on your own.
1,One word. NIGHTMARE
1,I do not recommend her at all. I would avoid her as much as possible. treats you like a high school student. poor time management skills. she got many problem wrong in from of the class in a row. Does not know material copies straight from book.
1,Avoid at all costs because she does NOT use Canvas and will never tell you what your grade is because she also teaches high school and uses that as an excuse.
1,She's the worst professor I've ever had at PCC. She basically copies the textbook to the board and she calls that a lecture. She wasn't even able to answer any questions. It really made me wonder why I was in that class. I DO NOT recommend you to take her even if you are good at math. Her class will bore you to death.
3,Okay so i am going to start with the good things because this professor isn't a terrible person just really tough. She stops for questions students have. Her grading is really tough though. On tests she deducts many points for small mistakes even for handwriting. If math isn't your thing its going to be tough. Homework is worth almost nothing.
1,Never ever ever ever take her im in class right now we just got another test and more than half the class failed. She can't teach well but she grades you work even worse she will take all your points for the dumbest reason
3,The material we learn is definitely not hard. She is a nice and some what a humorous teacher. She has helpful methods There are a few things I would say. She is very picky on how she wants the homework done (it is graded based on correct answers)  you are not allowed a calculator  and she kinda gets frustrated when you interrupt to ask a question.
4.5,She's a nice person  gives her time to students who utilizes office hours. Hard coursework and a lot of homework  but doing it really helps with the exam. Pick if you can allot enough time for it
2,Avoid at all costs. Nice person  terrible teacher. I'm going to barely pass  most of my classmates have to retake next semester. Only copies problems from the books  and gets irritated when was stopped to explain the steps. I spent a lot of time teaching myself from the book. Her grading system is very arbitrary too
1,Do yourself a favor and do not take her class. Only take her if you are really good in math otherwise you'll have a really hard time struggling. She's very difficult to understand and not that helpful. Her lectures are tedious. I usually don't write reviews but I felt obligated to for this professor because she the worst professor i've had at PCC.
1,Tooooooooo bad
1,She is the worst professor that I've ever had at PCC. She can't even answer your questions. All she does is copy the textbook on the board... Her lecture is EXTREMELY BORING. Avoid her if possible.
5,Do HW  it will help you to study for the exam.
2,I didn't dislike Professor Browne as a person  but as a teacher she is very difficult to follow along with. If you have trouble in math  I would not recommend taking her class. Too much lecture  without the in class practice. If for some reason you do take her  talk to her one-on-one  because she is willing to help you.
1,Not a good professor  she makes the easiest problems harder than they already look. Also  she deducts way too many points from homework and tests for a simple mistake. Take her at your own risk!
1.5,On the first day of class  she stated she was not a statistician. She literally only writes definitions on the board and nothing else. she likes to repeat how much she doesnt know about stats and that she only knows math. not really worth taking the class  unless you dont want to learn how to calculate the actual stats.
2.5,It was a complete surprise to me on the first day of class. Basically  she is the human version of the textbook. She doesn't really know statistics and even admitted that. Most of the time  she'll be writing stuff on the board  writing down formulas and doing example problems. Half the time  I didn't understand the purpose behind it.
5,Her class is hard  you must do homework  & show-up for class. But she is very helpful & knows what she's talking about. I would say her class is for self-starters who need little guidance. Tests are good if you did H.W. & asked questions when needed. People who fail her class don't do the H.W. or ask clarifying questions.
4,[Im continuing my review from the one below] The other comments seem ridiculous. Her looks don't matter  it's about how she can help you. If you are not afraid to ask for help take her. She won't push you away. She does have a little tardy issue but that just means you can be a little late yourself. I wish she was teaching 131 this semester!
4,You have to GIVE UP to not pass.She is very willing to help you unless you are always absent & act like you could care less.She WILL answer your Q's & sometimes right before the tests students could write a problem on the board from the study guide. I got a B b/c I never did word problems.Also HW isn't too important it's more about your test grade.
1,one of the worst teachers I had at cca
4.5,Jean's Swiss-educated background challenges the dominant CCA graphic design philosophy that been perpetuated by groupthink. Students who embrace her method of teaching typography will benefit tremendously from a pedagogy that is rarely found on the West Coast and enriches CCA's otherwise one-note graphic design curriculum. We are lucky to have her.
3,This instructor is slightly insane but I think in a good way. You will have so much homework you want to die. But she is fair about giving extensions and cares deeply about teaching and the subject matter. You will learn a lot.
3,Teacher was so focused on getting assignments completed that she ignored the needs of the students creating a negative learning environment. She often would not allow breaks  would teach during lunch    and assigned more homework then possible  leaving students tired and stressed. Take another teacher if possible.
2,Created a hostile class environment. Sarcastic about our work. Very negative experience.
1,definitely plays favorites! she sure sees the weaknesses and keeps reminding you without telling you what to do about it. didn't get anything out of her class cuz she doesn't know how to teach. i also saw how she was with ESL students  very mean and unhelpful!
5,The class is pretty hard  but she's a very very good teacher. She could see the strength and weaknesses of students. She helps students to understand the fields of typography. Really learn alot from her class.
4.5,Jean is a great professor. The class was hard and a lot of work but I learned a lot. I think I wasted more than a ream of paper drawing letters but that's what it takes. Some people think she has favorites. I don' t know if that's true but if you work hard and show interest  she'll like you.
4,Oh  cry  cry  cry. If you work hard for Jean she sees that  the grade is not the point anyway. Open your eyes. Jean is an excellent teacher. The people who don't like Jean try to get by on mediocar work and expect to get an A for just completing the assignment.
1,"nightmare i didnt end up learn much she grade people  not their work.i tried to hand in the same A+ work from my friend but she graded F to me.also i am a ESL and she was not helpful to explain assignment in a good temper way ""why don't you read the handout one more time before asking question"""
5,Fun teacher who teaches students how to letter space  rag  and lead from a Swiss Basel manner. She is not as bad as people say. I DID NOT GET A GOOD GRADE in her class. I am saying this because she not as bad as people say she is  but not super spectacular.butshecaresaboutherstudentsnotlikepatbrunin
1,Nightmare. Emotionaly unstable. Clueless. Makes class a stressfull and intolerant environment full of anxiety and fear.
3,Totally fake and inhuman. She kills the subject.
5,Awesome. Very helpful and organized. Kind person  so don't be afraid to ask for help. Always looking out for her students. Knows what she's doing.
5,She is one of the best professors I think  she really knows what she is doing and you can tell she is definitely interested in her work. Very nice to students and is funny. Keeps you involved  doesn't lecture all class so it moves fast. Very clear as to what's on tests and is helpful. I went from a C in Borger-Greco's 100 class to a Bt in her 102.
5,Soooo nice  really cares about what the students have to say  and sooo helpful and understanding. Her passion for what she teachers makes you interested in the subject  even if you weren't before the class. Def recommend her  take her if you get the chance. She awesome!
5,She is the nicest teacher en so helpful and happy. Her classes are never boring. She is always prepared. You should def. take her.
5,had her for 101 and liked her  everything you do counts for grade in that class making it easy  online assignments are easy  very nice and helpful  come to class  do homework  it's hard not to do well in the class  best span prof I've ever had
5,Everything a professor should be. So easy  so clear on presentations. You could basically have never taken high school Spanish and you would be completely fine. Homework is easy and tests are straightforward. It would be harder to fail the class than to pass it. TAKE HER!!
5,SOOOO easy! Her tests are a breeze and she only includes the easiet stuff in the chapters...take her if you can for an easy A
3,She is soo nice. Lots of homework but its easy. Tests are so easy!!! Especially if you have had prior spanish experiance. Makes class as fun as possible.
5,best proff i've ever had so far. very enthusiatic and helpful. she loves what does  and goes out of her way to make class more enjoyable. always does a review for tests. there is no reason to do poorly in this class. she is awesome.
5,Tests are easy as long as you study a bit for them. Very helpful. Is funny when she talks to herself in spanish. 'Hola! como estan?' haha
5,For beginners  and everyone  Dr. Chambers is very helpful. Tests are easy as long as you pay attention in class and look over the info. She's really nice and makes class very interesting.
5,She's a great prof! She is very friendly and always willing to help if you have questions.
4.5,she is a very nice  kind person. She speaks spanish clearly and is willing to help you if you ask. She is very interesting in class and shows enthusiasm! you'll do fine on tests if you study b/c they are not super hard.
5,very nice  made the class easy and fun
5,Very nice. Speaks in spanish and then explains what she said. Very helpful for those who have never had Spanish before. Super nice too! And the class is a breeze! (Just study! you'll do fine!)
5,AWESOME teacher
5,No Comments
5,Very good teacher  good sense of humor. Very smart.
3.5,He's a smart guy and loves technology (most people his age are technophobes  so it's good he knows how to use a computer). His online tests are nice because you can retake them as many times as you want untill you get 100% (except the last test  the final). But he's soooo borring. I'd never fallen asleep in a class until I took his class in Fall of 2003. You can learn some good stuff if you pay attention  and that's a big if. Very dry and borring. Class isn't to hard though.
4.5,Listen folks  the guy has to teach 60+ uninterested students and he is obviously a tech nerd. I spent quite a bit of time talking to him outside of class and found him more than helpful and personable. If you want a good grade  do what it takes.
1,No Comments
1,I changed my major after taking him.
1,Worst professor I ever had.He is rude and is not a good teacher. If you can avoid is class  do so. I dont care how long his resume is. That doesn't mean he can teach.
1.5,Probably the most boreing class i have ever had to sit through...if it wasnt for his WEEKLY F***ING quizes on BS i would have never gone. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
1,Loves C's like they proved his teaching skills. Is ill tempered and generally just annoying  avoid if you can  especially for reporting.
1,He may have a long resume  but that does not mean he knows how to teach. In fact he was one of the worst professors of my college career. not because he was hard but because he was so inept at teaching the subject. In addition  he was short tempered and rude. During one of our midterms he sat in the
2.5,Boring class... Felt like I did not learn much. Hard grader when it comes to papers. Expects us to be knowledgeable reporters who know their stuff when we never been reporters in our lives. Too much expectation. Made it difficult. Not that good of a teacher. Very tough!
2.5,this prof is soooo boring. this course is basically an intro kind of course in journalism  but he treats students as if they're experienced reporters. this class also has TONS of readings & online quizzes on very random topics found in the NY times. everything is powerpount
2,Very hard course... You can learn a lot  but he's not helpful  easy or clear in what he wants from his students. You feel as though your never work doesn't improve  but tough it out and you'll get through it. Take someone else if you expect an easy course  but take Johnson if you want to learn.
3,EVERY class is a power point lecture -It was painful! Weekly quizes based on reading  lecture and any newspaper story he felt like. Hard grader too. Most people dropped the class. Not very personable or considerate as a teacher.
2,I enjoyed the class  even though at times it was painful trying to keep my eyes open. But I learned a lot about journalism and how it is changing through the use of technology.
2.5,HARD. Very impersonal. You'll feel like you're failing for at least the first month. You learn a LOT  but there are better professors in this department.
4,Mr. Johnson is very knowledgable about journalism and seems very smart  but his class is extremely boring. All he does is lecture and give power point presentations EVERY single class. The information presented is SO boring and I don't think very useful.
5,extremely knowledgable. you will learn twice as much with johnson as you would in the same class with diff. professor. take johnson if you want to be a good journalist  not if you are looking for ease.
2.5,One word: BORING. That describes both him AND the class. His lectures are the most boring thing I have ever experienced in my life. I stopped going after the first few. I recommend it if you like classes that are mostly online  though.
1,This guy knows how to stretch out his resume but does know how to teach.
4,A total bore. He has a Powerpoint presentation for everything. Wanna know the history of the magazine? Powerpoint presentation. Send an e-mail? Powerpoint presentation. Chew gum while walking? Powerpoint presentation. Still  he's smart and a
5,Incourages students to learn technology. Could do journalism with his eyes closed.
3,Hes alright but the hype is really unjustified. His rating should be around 3.0. Lectures are out of the book and homework problems are obviously way different than the generic book examples. Weekly quizzes on the unit circle got old after awhile when one little mistake could cause a 60%. Not a bad guy though
5,BEST PROFESSOR  I loved math class with Mr. Moliassa! He explains the curriculum pretty well and he's always available if you need help  especially if you show him you care about doing well in the course he will do his best to help you. Be prepared to work though. You won't regret taking math class with him.
2,Am actually shocked at how high of a rating he has  homework is due every week and is only worth 10% of the grade while the tests are worst 70% and are way harder than homework. He's also very confusing to follow and he goes so fast  not the best if you arent strong in math for sure.
2,Tests are near impossible to finish and account for most of grade. Does not grade on a curve. Only covers examples exactly as written in textbook  the tests and quizzes are in a completely different format than homework. Alot of homework assigned for very little % of grade. Most will struggle with him unless you already know subject well.
5,Best math teacher I have ever had. He taught math is a way I could understand and always available for help. Had office hours before class  I would stop in every morning to ask questions either on homework or take home quizzes. Helps you on quizzes or offers you to redo tests for credit. Builds relationships with students  funny and is awesome.
5,This professor is AWESOME! If you show him that you care  he will help you raise your grade! Make sure to do your homework and and go to his office before you submit a quiz and after you submit in exam  this will guarantee you to get a higher grade! you willl NOT regret taking this course with him  he's the best!
5,You will not regret taking a class with him. I have always struggled with math and thought calc would be impossible for me  but he made it understandable. He's very funny  cares about students  and makes a lecture for a very boring subject interesting. The textbook for this class is VERY complicated  so don't expect to pass easily if you don't show
4.5,Made class more enjoyable and made a rather complicated subject understandable. Has available office hours before class and is always willing to help. He is also one of the goofiest and funniest professors I've had!
5,Best professor I've ever had! I normally dread math class and do poorly in the class but this was the one exception. As long as you attend class  take notes  and make sure you do your homework this class will be fairly easy. Mr. Moliassa is an excellent professor  he's funny and easy to listen to and is always available to help!
3.5,He's very good at explaining complicated concepts in a simple way and is helpful if you reach out to him. But his tests are IMPOSSIBLE. The calc class I took was an hour and 10 mins and he requires his tests to be completed during 1 class period. The tests are very long and if you go over time he deducts points. Because of this I am failing.
3.5,Moliassa is a really odd guy. He gets a little too enthusiastic about math. He's a good guy though and really helpful. He's good at making difficult topics easy to understand. Going to class is necessary to passing.
5,This class felt like my high school math classes. You have homework assigned every night  but not a lot. If you need help he LOVES to help. He's kind of a goofy guy so the class is a little bit more enjoyable for a math class. I would recommend him to anyone.
5,Great teacher. I am terrible at Math and bombed the first exam. Mr. Moliassa worked with me through out the semester and I ended up with a good grade in the class. ATTEND CLASSES. Don't give up on this class.
3.5,Do not take him if you struggle in math. funny but moves quickly and erases board to fast. Do HW and quizzes they will help your grade if you struggle with the tests.
4.5,Moliassa is a hilarious & makes math fun! He often came to class with chalk all over his face & always said good morning even though it was evening. He was very helpful and clarified a lot of topics for me. After having Moliassa for pre-calc I became so interested in math that I ended up taking calculus even though it's not required for my degree.
5,Explains clearly  gives time to practice examples in class.Very organized and thorough. Expects some prior knowledge  but will walk you through when needed.Do the homework  he gives 100% without checking each answer.Gives study guides for exams. Go to class-he gives test questions when only a few people show up. Funny  knowledgable and passionate.
3.5,Good professor. Math is not an easy subject for me and I ended up getting a B in the class. Definitely make sure he knows who you are and that you actually care about getting a good grade. It will help you in the end. Going into his office for help is definitely worth it.
4,Overall a good professor. Probably the best that teaches 118. My only complaints are that he moves pretty fast when doing problems on the board  and erases his work from the board pretty fast. He does help students a lot in his office  but he seems to get frustrated easily. Overall good professor though  I would recommend him.
5,AMAZING PROFESSOR
4,This class was pretty hard. He did his best to teach it and knew what he was talking about but many students were lost. He also got annoyed when people would ask questions during class. Overall it was decent
4,He will kick your butt and you will thank him for it. Our class went from 30 students to less than 10 by midterms. Read his powerpoints as he leaves clues as to what he will test on. Listen to his advice and study at least 24 hours a week. Make your own study guides. You have to put in the effort but he will work with you to help you succeed.
2,This man is hilarious wise inspiring and tries to use example in everyday life. However Proff Strong is very disorganized. We ended up using lab time for lecture time often and missed material not included in our books and when it came to exam time a lot of material was indeed not covered. If you're lost you'll be directed to THE search engine.
3,professor Strong is a really good professor class isn't easy  and you will have to study  take good notes  and maybe even watch a couple of videos in order to really understand the material expected to know on Exams .Mr. Strong does tutor after class or before in groups if needed to prepare for exams .No quizzes  No homework Studying is HW
5,Professor Strong is an awesome teacher. He teaches the science and relates it all to real life. If you stick with him he eases up towards the end of the semester. He is knowledgeable and wise. He is always willing to stay after class to help and even held a study group on a Saturday morning before finals. He's the best! Take him if you can.
5,Professor Strong wants you to learn the material so he will make you work for your grade. If you take your education seriously and don't expect to have your grade handed to you  take this class. This class taught me how to study for a test without memorizing general information. Truly one of my favorites.
4,I was worried when I decided to take this teacher. This is not an easy class. The teacher is wonderful and takes time to explain the material. If you hope to pass without studying this is not the class for you. If you like to learn from somebody who knows  I recommend this teacher. He is absolutely one of the best. You have to work very hard.
4,Prof. Strong is extremely energetic  makes sure everyone is participating throughout labs and lectures. If you put in the effort he will do the same. Skipping a class isn't the best idea  he does move quick but the book and powerpoint do help! He makes all of his tests and makes every question critical thinking (really tough).
2.5,Prof Strong is an okay professor. I found his lectures unclear/confusing. I basically taught myself by reading the chapters  going over the ppts  and creating my own study guides. His tests are tough  study everything!! If you ask for help  he is willing to help though. Lab practicals are easy if you study and go to the tutoring center.
4,He is a hard grader  but he wants you to know the subject not just memorize it to pass the test. If you're looking for an easy class  this is not for you. You will have to try REALLY hard to make an A. He does not curve  give extra credit  or make things easier for you.
3.5,Strong was one of my most favorite teachers. About half of my class dropped  but I feel it was due to laziness. If you are not a lazy student and you put the time in  you can guarantee an A or a B. I had a 3 month old baby  a job  and took this class. I worked my butt off and made a B with a lot of help from Mr . Strong. He is an amazing teacher.
2,RUN!! I MEAN RUN!!IF YOU WANT TO PASS WITH A DECENT GRADE DO NOT TAKE HIM. I HAVE TAKEN A&P I HAVE A MASSAGE LICENSE AND I AM DROPPING MID SEMESTER. NEARLY MY WHOLE CLASS IS FAILING  IN WHICH HE TAKES NO BLAME. HIS TESTS ARE PERSONALLY MADE AND DON'T MAKE SENSE COMPARED TO THE LECTURE. TAKE SOMEONE ELSE!!
5,The most accurate review I've read of this prof is the one below me. Rest are exaggerating. YES  it's tough. But do you really think nursing school is easy? Sorry to say  heck no. And about the accent  really? If normal human can make it through his class  everyone can. It's not hard to understand him. He teaches excellent and is a doctor himself.
4,Prof. Strong really cares about you. Yes  his tests are difficult but coming from a former professor from UT Health  what do you expect? He trains you for nursing school because keep in mind  nursing school is not easy. I recommend taking him if you can accept the challenge because in the long run  you will learn an awful amount.
2.5,He's a good teacher but there isn't enough time to study for that much information when you have family and kids he's really critical on studying and test aren't what you think you don't really know where the exam is coming from he doesn't give reviews or study guides
1.5,ITS VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND HIM!!!!!!!!! he wont give you reviews for any exam.... not very helpful :( PLEASE DON'T BUY HES BOOK we don't even use it and its very expensive
1,Apart from his hard to understand Jamaican accent. He tends to skip topics and trick you on test. For ex: on one exam (multiple choice) he didn' tell us that there was more than one answer  so while grading he mentioned it and most of the class didn't pass   REALLY? --BTW NO EXTRA CREDIT  NO REVIEWS GIVEN. Beware of this professor it is not helpful
4,Still in the semester. TOUGH so far but there's a lot I have already learned. Def a challenging class but what you put in you will get out.
4.5,I speak for all when I say this professor is just amazing. On my point of view  he is not only a professor but also an advisor who wishes nothing more than the best in your career
3,Professor Strong is a good man  who genuinely cares about hes students. The test are hard because he doesnt want students to memorize the material but to understand how it works. He get nicer as the semester progress  so dont give up quickly. For example he starts giving reviews for test  broad reviews  but they do help. If you do the work  study hard and come to class theres no need to worry.
5,Not a class for people who don't want to work. If you want to sleep through class or expect him to give away grades... choose a class that you can pass without learning. He will explain concepts over and over until everyone understands. Take him if you want to succeed in nursing.
5,Timely on grading. He made the subject interesting and used thought provoking questions and great examples. I would look for this teacher for future classes.
4,I took him for BioLab. I was scared because I have never had a science lab before. It ended up being a great time! He is fun and helpful. The lab was pretty easy.
4.5,Can earn an A if you do the work. There is a decent amount to do  but it's not too difficult. Very thorough comments in assignments. Fast turnaround when grading.
5,On-line Class: His is very Ccear with requirements. This class is not a soft class  but is not extreme. This class can be done  while taking other ACCEL classes.
5,Great Teacher!! Very direct and tells you up front what he likes and dislikes. Learned a lot in class.
3,I got great grades but didn't learn a darn thing. I'm surely paying for it now in my career.
4,labs were ok  not hard  but not boring either always kept me busy
3.5,No Comments
3.5,Hate science  he made me love it. Very interesting class.
5,very cool  fun  interesting
1,RUN FAR AWAY. I repeat do not take it. She was aware her entire class was full of nursing majors and were forced to take this class for our core classes and made sure she made it as difficult as possible. Her lectures are dragged on and she talks about the same topic for 45 minutes. Also  the power points do not help. They are literally 4 slides.
2,think twice before taking this class with her  she is nice but when grading her papers  and the exams is the opposite.
3.5,Winn is clearly a professor who knows her material. Her course is not too hard  but not to easy. You definitely earn the grade given. She'd very fair and very helpful. If you're lost with the material  she'd help without hesitation.
4.5,Professor Winn is an EXCELLENT instructor.There are times when she is unclear however when asked Prof Winn will explain until it becomes clear. She also encouraged questions and was very open with after class help if you needed it. She is very enthused about the material which made her a joy to be around!!
2.5,study study and study the text book and DO the sample question. she give 4 quizzes with max 4 question. the questions can have 4 part anwers to it. she does not curve. she teaches from powerpoints and the last half hour of class are sample problems for the upcoming test. she knows her class is hard. again study everything she gives you.
2.5,very hard and she knows it. She explains the first class in order to pass her test you must study note  power pt  and read text book. The test questions arent study terms and definitions they are how to connect terms. If you take this corse good luck I got a C
3,Her tests are indeed hard and inconsistent with anything in lectures. Take if you are willing to read 50 or more pages a night  and somehow retain random knowledge for the tests. Otherwise avoid. She is very knowledgeable however and very friendly. Not a terrible teacher  but her tests are really really hard.
2,her tests are impossible  very boring class..her powerpoints are pointless they don't help you at all. don't take her if you can help it. run awayy!!
5,Enjoyed class and learne so much. you get out of it what you put in to it. You will not fail her course if you read and study. I struggled through her course and earned a A- and no it was not easy but it was well worthy it. I feel ready for grad school. If you are looking for and easy A cake walk class this is not the professor for you.
2,very nice but not a very good teacher. Does a powerpoint for every class and reads from it. Exams every two weeks that are impossible to pass. There are 4 questions on each exam and even after reading the book and studying the powerpoints still failed! The material is difficult and the exams impossible.
1.5,She is a very nice lady and that is the only nice thing I could find to say. Her lectures are not clear and have nothing to do what is on her test. Do not depend on your notes or her notes they won't help you. YOU MUST READ THE BOOK A LEAST 5 TIMES. The test come directly from the book. Do not depend on a review she won't give one. DON'T TAKE HER.
4.5,She is a very interesting teacher. She does weird demo. (remembering her fire alarm scream) but she explains things pretty well. She gives 4 exams but 1 will be drop. Mostly multiple choice that can be study from book. one paper. easy class but can be boring from time to time when she talks.
1.5,very very boring class
1,Run. Very. Far. Away.
4,She isnt that bad of a teacher you def have to read the book because she doesnt go over everything in class the tests r ok just have to study hard easy grader on papers and tends to scream  bark  and kick when she does demonstrations (a lil wierd)
3.5,Not as bad as people think... I have no attention span tests r multiple choice and you should read but i havent and i got a C papers arent to bad and there arent many.... It could be worse..
4,She's a nice lady. Start studying for the tests now. If you study alot and take good notes you'll succeed and dont for get to show up and participate
4,she is a great person with a lot of enthusiasm for psych. i remember liking her classes.
4.5,Amazingly insightful professor -- know I'm in the minority here  but I loved her lectures. Take notes  know your material  ask her any questions you may have and you'll be set.
2.5,Exams are impossible! Entirely too much for an Intro class. 4 exams  1 is dropped (but don't let that fool you). Notes = essential  to get anything above a D or C  you must thoroughly read the book (many hours of studying). Book is terrible  very long reads (1hr+ per chapter) Don't take if you're not a Psychology major!
5,Love this professor! She's a little disorganized  but it's not too bad because she's super lenient on assignments and always very helpful. She's so passionate about the material  which really engages you. She is the type of professor you will remember years down the road when you look back at your education. Take this professor! You'll learn a lot.
1,The prof was missing in action. The entire semester she seldom interacted with students. Maybe teaching is a low priority
4.5,Probably one of the best educational experiences I've ever had. I wanted to applaud after every lecture. Great teacher if you actually give a crap about trying to learn the material.
4,Great teacher  great lecturer. You can tell she lives and breathes the material  which is pretty inspiring. Loved her class. Too bad she doesn't teach Political Theory on the regular.
5,Anyone seriously interested in political theory should take Dr. Condit. Her class intellectually challenged me more than any other. I do wish however  that she had been more clear about which readings we would be tested on. Both the reading scheduled AND study guides she posted would have assigned readings that just wouldn't show up on the tests.
5,She is a fantastic prof. The individual who questioned her commitment to her online course has obviously never gone in during her office hours. So helpful and caring. If you are going to rate a college prof. you should probably spell check your submission so that it seems as if you actually have the intellect required to pass a college course!
1,Dr. Condit is the worst online professor I've ever had at VCU. She took on a new chair role in the poli sci department  and very obviously can't handle that and teaching. We'll go 2+ weeks without hearing from her  and NEVER has anything up on time. Ne I understand she's busy  but being MIA from her students is completely unacceptable
5,She was the bee's knees
4,I'm a conservative grassroots activist and I expected the worst walking into a Condit class. (There are rumors.) Her class challenged me intellectually more than any other class I've had at VCU. Were this a sword battle  I would bow and compliment her on a well-fought engagement. Take Condit  especially if you're conservative.
2.5,Ridiculously rambling lectures. Made it halfway through the syllabus by the end of the semester and instead talked about her passions of feminism and hating children. Tests are all multiple choice and draw from the lectures. The class is easy and she curves everything. Just know that every lecture you go to is going to feel like five hours.
4.5,If you have not taken a Condit class you are crazy! She is an amazing person. Helpful and understanding. However  her class is not structed by any means. Very inconsistent with due dates and assignments. Class discussions are great and will always keep you interested  she really makes you think! Oh  be prepared for a group project...
3.5,Very nice lady. Tends to not describe all topics very clearly and tends to go off on tangents about feminism. She is very opinionated and she wants it known. Chances are you will probably disagree with her at some point  but she does make you learn. She is also kind of flexible on grading  I certainly did better than I thought I would.
4.5,She is one of the greatest professors i've had so far. She has a way of connecting real life with the things we have to learn in class to make everything interesting. You HAVE to do the reading  otherwise you'll fail the tests. Read and come to class and you'll do fine.
3,The initial meeting of her was deceitful. She's very liberal and vocal about it (in which I'm opposite). I thought I would hate the class but loved it. She's very passionate about what she does and it shows. She will open your mind for sure. It's a great class to take because she truly is brilliant on this topic.
4,I thought to myself upon entering her class.....wow  she is a die-hard liberal  and I am NOT going to be happy. However  I would recommend her to everyone considering Poli Sci. She will open your mind to things you previously have never thought of. I can truly say she is brilliant
4,she's a really good teacher but her class can be boring sometimes. i went like 4 times in the whole semester and still got an A because i studied for her tests. MUST DO THE READINGS: very important.
4,Very fun class. Probably because it was a 100 level though. Great discussions on the material and she did answer most questions students had. Tests weren't hard either. Again being 100 level class likely played a huge part in this as well.
3.5,Well  she's and interesting woman for sure! I took this class at the pinnacle of my first relationship. I came to love women and myself as a woman. I know I became more powerful inside myself  and I learned to love others more fully. My one qualm  the class is a little doomsday/end-of-the-world-ish. I say take it  but keep in mind  humanity is okay
3,she never responds to emails. its incredibly annoying and frustrating especially when she is grading your papers and is taking her merry time doing it.
5,When the semester started  I was really put off by Dr. Condit  but my opinion changed. Yes  she's very liberal and yes she can be too vocal about that. However  she has excellent insight into general concepts of politics  and the discussions are valuable. She's also probably the only professor I've had at VCU who really CARES about her students.
5,Marlos is a great instructor. She has a wealth of knowledge and I always learn a lot in all of the classes I take with her. The friendliest professor in the department.
3.5,ok teacher. Read labs before class and try to do assignments or they will take up the whole lab. Adds stuff to test that she talks about that isn't found in the book or on the lab so take notes. Seems very knowledgeable on subject matter as well as enthusiastic about teaching. Failed to stop disruptive talking during her lecture.
1,Hard. Unorganized. Exams were terrible. Labs were time consuming. Not worth your time or effort.
4.5,Really a nice woman. I didn't care for the amount of work to do in lab that was worth very little points. She is very helpful though.
4,I liked her but I struggled a little in her class. At times her lecture was hard to follow but there was time in class for her to help the students privately  which she was more than willing to do.
4.5,Great and interesting class. Marlos clearly enjoys the material. Great hazard movies. Must actually read the book though.
4.5,Marlos is full of knowledge and experience. She seems to know a lot about the subject  and seems to like input. ADVICE: Presentations due at different times  some people get 2 weeks to write it - others get 2 months. Choose smart! There are a lot of movies and you have to pay attention - you will be tested on them!!
5,Positive attitude
4,Good Prof but remember EVERYTHING she says in lab because it WILL be on the exam. Very helpful.
5,One of the best Professors I have had. Always willing to talk to you and answer your questions. Must pay attention in class to get a good grade on the tests. Overall - Take her class if you can !
4,A bit speedy in presenting material but always willing to help. Also a fair grader.
5,Very good prof  puts things clearly  and makes the class interesting and easy to follow. If you can I would suggest taking her.
5,Great Intructor! Easy going and personable. She does explain things very well and I found her very helpful. Tests are difficult but fair so know your stuff and you will do fine.
2.5,Doesnt explain very well...was offended when asked to spend more time on topics
4,I had her for lab. the assignments were reasonable  but the tests were really hard. there were a lot of formulas you needed to memorize in order to know how to do charts  etc.
5,Great professor! Clear on what she wants from you. I enjoyed going to the class. It was an interesting class you should take it with her if you can. It's Environmental Hazards and Natural Disasters.
4.5,She was great! Always there to help. Test can be very hard though. Study  study  study.
4.5,She's good at explaining the labs even if the material is a little difficult. I think she's over all pretty good.
4,Be warned! Everything  I mean everything she covers in class is on the exams
3,Her lab I found to be extremely difficult. She does well lecturing but it was difficult to get her help on the lab  at times. She doesn't really care to help you understand the terms. Study the rocks for the final!
5,I enjoyed this class. There's 5 modules and you get 3 weeks for each one. There's a few assignments  a blog post  and a quiz each module. Totally doable amount of work. Only thing is  for the blog you need to work with your group and a lot of people wait until the last minute. Cooke was very helpful and informative either way. Highly recommended!
3,GEOG 1200 online and it was a fair amount of work. The problem is that his quizzes are not reflected by the material learned. There would be a true/false or MC that had a graded answer different from what the book said  so that was not fair. Also he did not give feedback on why you got the grades you did on discussion posts and essay questions
3,This was my second class with Prof. Cooke and I can't say he was much more organized than the first time. Prof. Cooke means well and is a nice guy  but he just seems all over the place and not clear on his assignment requirements.
1,Highly would not recommend taking a class with this individual. His grading scale/requirements for exams is non existent and his professionalism/integrity as a professor is severely lacking to say the least.
3,Professor Cooke cares about the subject and the students  but is extremely disorganized. Overall the lectures are interesting. He is a harsh grader  but curves the grades a lot. The textbooks are completely unnecessary even though he made us buy four of them.
2.5,The materials covered in this class are informative and interesting  and Prof. Cooke is helpful too. The only issue I have with the class is the opinionated questions on the quizzes.
3.5,I took Dr. Cooke's URBN 1200 course online over the summer. Dr. Cooke is pretty knowledgable and It was an interesting course. There was no textbook and he just had you do assigned readings on HuskyCT. Your grade was based on 12 writing assignments and your comments on other student's assignments and he dropped your two lowest scores.
3,Overall  this class was petty. There's no textbook and slides are posted online before class. However  you will still need to go to lecture in order for you to know his anecdotes or opinions that he often puts on the exam. The material was not hard  however  it was not fun and can become time consuming. Cooke is a funny professor tho
2,Doesn't really care about the course. Asks terrible questions on the tests that are completely ambiguous- asks T/F questions on opinionated topics. Says he'll curve final grades  but didn't for our class. Just a terrible course overall  don't take it if you don't have to.
2,3.5 average and this class is going to bring it down. VERY difficult exams. Do not take class
3.5,Tests are kinda hard but he cancelled the final and gave everyone a 100  the lowest test grade out of four including the final was dropped so it essentially counted for a third of the grade
3,He is an ok Professor. Very nice  but can ramble. Going to class is not necessary. He posts all of the slides online before the lecture. There are three exams. The final (third exam) contains word for word questions from the first two  so make sure you review those with the TA. There is a generous curve on everything  and extra credit offered.
2,The information in this class is pretty useless  but all notes and readings are posted online  so no need to go to class or buy a textbook. He curves all the exams even when he says he doesn't  and offered a short extra credit paper at the end of the class. Not the most helpful professor but easy overall!
1,Sounds like he's a great teacher in the class room  however online is the worst grading rubric in the world. He gave me a 0 for an assignment out of 15  which I did complete in it's entirety. Not even one point for trying. I would NEVER recommend him for an online class.
5,Urban studies doesn't really interest me  but Cooke is a good lecturer and it's an easy A.
5,I signed up for this cities course not expecting much out of it - but it grew on me so much that I enjoyed coming in to class. He makes it very interesting if you like history & some funny jokes. Grading is quite easy  exam questions are given beforehand so you can study for them. I love how I learn most in classes that don't require much studying.
4,One of the best classes I have taken at UConn. Enjoyed the material and his teaching style. Only complaint is time granted on the tests. Overall great class.
4.5,Great Professor  very funny and interesting. The class grade is based on only 3 exams. He curves everything. Going to class and taking notes is very helpful.
4.5,I loved his class. I definitely recommended taking his class.
4.5,I had Cooke for a once a week class for population geography. I thought that he was entertaining and kept the class relatively light considering some of the material. Only 2 exams and a paper for grades. I enjoyed the class and so long as you attended and took a few notes  you will be prepared for the exams.
1,Professor griffin is very rude . She missed class at least three times for personal reasons  which is fine   life happens !!! But lets hope it doesnt happen to you because she will give you an F for missed assignments ! No late turn ins. She is unreasonable . Rude. And unhappy . I worked extremely hard and still for a D . Her grading is bias.
5,I took English 1301 and 1302 with Ms. Griffin during my freshman year. Her classes are not easy  but if you're interested in LEARNING or are up for a challenge and ready to receive A LOT of constructive criticism  this is it. I made a C in 1301  B in 1302
1,The absolute worst professor I have ever taken. I have had lots of professors. I am a hard working student who cares about my grades. She is disrespectful degrading  and worst doesn't care at all about the student and just likes to give bad grades just for the fun of it. Also no structure in the classroom
1,I was a first time freshman in college taking Ms. Griffin and she was okay to start off but over time she became very annoying and rude. She was out spoken and spoke to me like i was a child most of the time. She steps out of her place a lot jokingly or not. I wouldnt recommend to anyone
3,Dr. Griffin is a great person  very funny and cares. She barely teaches during lectures  and your weekly work was online and would be due at weird times throughout the week. She also had online quizzes and a couple extra credit papers. At the end of the semester we had an APA research paper and a 3-5 min. vlog which was difficult. very tough grader
3,for any English majors  or if you want a challenge to improve your English she is a perfect match. She is a tough grader  very detailed. At the end of semester she had us do a vlog and research paper about a leader based on leadership so start on time. She is a great person & can be reasonable if you talk with her on time.
2,I did not understand her grading. Her lectures were poor  so you learned nothing other than what's due. A few office hours  so pray god to catch her. Almost no extra credit till there was 6 left from 25
3,She's very goofy
2,I took Professor Griffin online. One  her quizzes are confusing. She would have one part of the question mimic the book and then the second half of the question she adds her twist to it. Second  her writing assignments. She wants both the written portion of a paper and a vlog lecture. She wants u 2physically come up to the school for writing papers
5,She is a great teacher. Her classes are not easy  but it's a nice way to challenge yourself. She knows what she is talking about and she responds to your email rapidly. Beware she is very sassy and will roast the students who neither do the work or did it completely wrong from her instructions. she gives a lot of grace.
4,She's a good professor overall  but if you're looking to do nothing and get an A she's not for you. She's a tough grader  but is there to help if you ask. She's adamant about class participation so she'll call everyone out at some point. Her class isn't easy and only those who really want to learn will stay. My class count went from 30 to about 8.
1,The most unreasonable professor I have ever taken. She is extremely rude to her students and talks to them as if they are below her. Gives poor instructions  and doesn't provide help. Responds to her students rudely and does not have a problem yelling at them. VERY unprofessional. She is in the wrong field if she is not passionate about teaching.
2,Horrible grading
4,Ms. Lashun Griffin is a really great teacher . If you need help? She's there to help you. She does grade her papers tough  but her comments and feedback would help you do better. If you want to pass this course  You cannot procrastinate on her class.
5,Professor Griffin is a fantastic English teacher. She is very caring and yes she is a tough grader but she literally GIVES YOU STEP BY STEP instructions on what she is requiring from you. The class is difficult if you procrastinate and do not stay on top of your game . I am taking her for my English 1302
4,I took Mrs. Griffin during my first semester of college. I didn't know what I was getting myself into. It was challenging  she was very intimidating  but she did help with giving good feedback on my papers. We had to do like a mid-term timed writing and a 7 page paper  as final  and a presentation of you presenting your thesis that you wrote about
2,I took this class online and regret it because eventually had to drop it. You have to come into this class as a professional writer. Very stressful and makes you write a 3-4 paper in a short time span. Not really clear on her instructions and expects you to already know. Do not take if English is not your best subject.
5,"I absolutely loved this woman's class! She had such a huge impact on me and I'm sure she doesn't even realize it! She is a wonderful teacher and she makes sure that the students make her do her job. ""Don't leave this class until you understand  I'm here because of and for you!"" Wonderful professor I've taken for 1301 & 1302. I would take her again!"
5,I loved this class. Professor Griffin was so fun and sassy. It was not an easy class. Professor Griffin believed in us and had high expectations. I have fond memories of my semester with her.
1,Professor Griffin is not helpful at all. Her organization skills are very poor. We missed two weeks of class because of her personal issues  and we had no sub during that time. She does not explain anything right. Might come up with rude comments. Tries too hard to be funny. Very confusing. Tough grader. Don't recommend to take her classes.
1.5,A very unhelpful professor who prefers breaking up into groups four times in one class than actually teaching. Said during office hours that he does not give full credit at all. He is highly knowledgeable  but just a little odd man on a power trip.
5,He's the best teacher sociology teacher I have ever had. I've been through colleges & universities in norcal and socal & he's the best soc teacher. For the person who says he's cocky he's not really. But he has every right to feel smug. He's been through the peacecorp & he's trying to open a nonprofit. What the hell have you done for this world?
5,Amazing teacher that obviously loves what he does.
5,One of my favorite teachers. He always had the class laughing. There is a lot of thinking and writing involved in this class  but overall----VERY FUN! If you have to take SOC  take Ellis' class. You won't regret it!
4,if you want to understand how our society works  all the bad things that are going on and what we could do to stop them  this is the class for you. If you want a traditional and structured teaching style on what sociology is and does  then you won't like this class.
5,not only is Dr. Jones super cute he's also a really good teacher. He made me look at the things i did on a regular basis in a completely different light. Everyone should take him.
5,he's a cool guy. you don't really stress about the class.
3,Personally I didn't like his teaching style.I hate sitting in circles and having discussions  especially when the people are all super against corporations and they get into these big tyrades about how bad they are.There was too much focus on that and it got to be quite annoying. Should have dropped
2.5,No Comments
5,I haven't been able to see the world the same since.I continue to use his written book for a conscious living guide.He is gifted with groups and is more interested in teaching real-life application to social problems than the technicalities of the field.
3,You either like him or you think he's a strange little man. He tries to make you think he's very wise but when you analyze deeper  you see he's just a cocky  knowitall. If you like group work sitting in cicles and sharing feelings  this is the class 4 u
5,A very intresting class didnt know what to expect. He is a very cool teacher is style of teaching is like no other teacher. Hey makes you do pretty fun activities. You dont have test but must do the homework.
5,his teaching style is super cool. he is very warm and kind man.
5,Ellis is the best! His open teaching techniques provide students with a exciting school experience. This class is not another blah  blah  blah...
5,The most interesting and intriguing class I have ever encountered at SCC. The assignments seem odd but if you actually do them you will explore new areas of yourself and your acquaintances that you wouldnt have come across otherwise.
5,Not the best teacher for actually learning the science of sociology  but an amazingly fun and engaging class. No tests  but you cannot miss class once in a while or miss an assignment here and there and expect to get a decent grade. Highly reccomended.

5,Dr. Kuhlman is the best teacher in the chemistry department. Students will fight to get his class during registration. He is very helpful outside of class and explains his logic very clearly. However he places a lot of class percentage on tests.
5,Dr. Kuhlman is a great professor! He is helpful  willing to make time if you need assistance  and is really clear on what he expects of you.
5,He is a really great teacher and if you put effort into the class you will do well.
5,Extremely helpful professor. He is very committed to his students and he is always there to offer his help. He is the best professor ever  I would take again and I highly recommend him.
5,By far the best professor I've had the privilege to have at Denison. He's so enthusiastic about Biochemistry  and he will do whatever it takes to help you learn/understand  even if that requires him losing sleep. His understanding and willingness to help really made me want to do well in this class. If you get the chance  take a class with him!
5,Dr. Kuhlman is probably one of the best professors at Denison. He is the nicest professor I have had here and will do everything in his power to make sure you understand what you need to know. He even goes the extra mile and tries to help based on how you learn. Will take him again and maybe even another time after that!
4.5,He was a wonderful professor! Very busy man because he is always willing to help people in his spare time! He was also the head of the chem department! He is one of my favorite professors! Class is a little difficult  but he is so great at what he does that is not dreadful! I highly recommend that you take any chemistry class you can with him.
4.5,He's the most magnificent professor ever. He's a genius. He is dedicated to helping you out  and is just excellent at his job. His class may not be easy  but he is willing to explain things and help you out  as much as you're willing to be helped. Best professor at Denison!
5,Fantastic  helpful  kind  challenging  inspiring  and  in one of his favorite words: commendable! Lucky you to have this fabulous professor for chemistry.
5,I signed up for his class at 8:30 AM first semester  and didn't realize how hellish waking up that early would be with my workload. But when it came time for choosing my second semester chem class  and the only available time with Dr. K was 8:30 again  I gladly signed up to have him as the professor!
5,Dr. Kuhlman is a fantastic professor
5,This guy knows how to teach. He's so busy as chair of the department but he'll make time for you and he's amazing one on one. If you don't like paper tests  he'll let you do an oral test and he really works with your needs. Fantastic. Please take a class with him. He's a genius!
5,Excellent teacher. He explains everything very clearly  and keeps the class going at a manageable pace. If you don't understand something  he will work with you until you get it. If you're really interested in something  he'll encourage you further in it.
4,Dr. K is the best chem prof ever... he gives a ton of extra credit opportunities  very laid back  pretty cool over all. his class is much easier than any of the other classes  at least for Gen Chem. try to get his class.
5,I LOVE PETER KUHLMAN!If I could chemically make a baby with him I would! Best prof ever. He's so understanding  and is always there to help. I wish he taught all my classes. P.S. check out the paint!!
5,the best professor ever!! was very laid-back when it came to assignments...if we neede more time..he would give it to us!!! I LOVE YOU PK!!
5,He is AMAZING. Maybe my favorite prof ever
5,Hiss class is hard  but he is a good professor. He is very clear when he lecures...if you pay attention and come to class you will do well. If you need his class just to fill a requirement then i would not recommd him because he does have an easy a class. He is very good though
3,No Comments
1,Class was hard..And Very Boring..Test impossible
4.5,He is cool guy  interesting as well.
5,No Comments

5,Awesome class. I loved it. Best class I ever took.
3.5,I took him for an FYS and I thought he was really funny! His laugh is hysterical! I'm not an English major  so he might be difficult. He wasn't that hard for the FYS.
4,Very entertaining. Work/reading load was a bear. When I used cliff notes my grades were A's and when I didn't I got B's.
5,Dr. Hamlet expected a lot  but helped my writing 110%. Calling him pompous isn't fair--he's formal (unlike many Denison prof.'s) but he's there for us when we need him. If you're not lazy or clueless  he responds to you!
1,Pompous professor with the most egotistical writing I've ever seen.
1,I hope he's a better teacher than advisor. After two years with him  I walked in at the end of my junior year to ask about my thesis and he didn't even know my name.
2,you might hear about how loud his voice is--don't be fooled  it won't keep you awake or even slightly interested in the class. Ego problem! Beware!
4,Hilarious
1,he was so unhelpful and his lectures were took up the entire class period.
1,don't take him!
1,bad
1,"he's gone past being an abominable teacher. that's the problem with professors who let their own power get to their heads. watch out for his writing. he'll mark up everything on your papers btw  like a misplaced comma etc  and ask ""WHAT'S THIS????"" lousy  lousy  bloated  egotistical prof."
5,Don't trust the last few entries. Hamlet's class changed my life  and changed the way I read everything. Those who react badly to him must just be superficial or lazy.
1,bad bad bad
1,boring  lectures too much
3,"professor ham is a disgrace to his profession. He beats books to a pulp..which is good IF he allows the students to do the analyzing instead of ramming his own ""correct"" opinions down their throats. He blabbers more than any sane man I know and he thinks he's God because he has a loud voice. RETIRE!"
1.5,Hamlet was the worst English teacher I have ever had. He is arrogant  pompous and full of himself. He assigns prompts that are purposely ambiguous so he can lord it over you when you do poorly. (Hs writing indicates this) If you can regurgitate what he says  nod and swoon a lot then you'll do fine.
4.5,Dr. Hamlet was a great teacher. He is very loud though  so he is intimidating  but once you get past that  he is a really nice guy. He is pretty flexible and understanding about due dates etc.. But dont take one of his classes unless you are willing to work your butt off- he's tough.
2,Strange and Interesting man  questionable teacher. He will beat one aspect of a book to death unless the students comment during class. Tests aren't bad as long as you regurgitate what he tells you. Class is far more interesting when people participate and he isn't left to ramble for ages.
1,No Comments
2.5,Hamlet's course involves some incredible books  but it is an English course without discussion  and therefore isn't much of an English course. He is full of himself  redundant  and boring. His thoughts on each book could be much shorter.
4,Dr. Winters is a great professor! He will spend a significant amount of time helping you if you need it. He is passionate about his work and puts in a lot of effort to push students to get out of their comfort zones and think about topics in a more abstract manner. If you want to get an A in his class you have to be willing to work hard.
4,The professor is very friendly and loves to give to give students life lessons. The class can be boring at times boring because he loves to bounce around topics (anatomy to life). As for the exams  quizzes  and labs  they are very easy. Best advice  memorize everything and beware of falling behind in anatomy... otherwise it will bite you in da ass!
4,Funny guy  okay teacher  really easy class/tests - all multiple choice!
2.5,His lectures are permanent tangents!
3.5,His lectures are interesting for awhile  but sometimes you get the feeling that he just likes to hear himself talk. His tests are tough.
1.5,SO confusing! And the tests are excruciating. Likes to hear himself talk.

4,a good guy
4,He is very student oriented...but hard to follow sometimes
5,A very easy teacher. Very lenient if you miss assignments. Nice guy  too. Very friendly. If he's an option for whatever class you're picking  pick him for sure.
4.5,He is a nice Person who is very helpful
4.5,A really nice guy and a good counselor. Hes very helpful and knows his stuf well.

5,Great Counselor
5,good
5,Made the class interesting. Even enjoyed Oedipus  but no body can help Othello. She helped me to understand and enjoy English. I think she's a fantastic teacher and would take her again in a heart beat. Test are tuff though  ya have to read the material and study. Always an essay  but if you study you'll get it. And she is hot!!!
4.5,She tells a lot of personal stories in class. Easy to persuade and you can make her change the syllabus! She won't put you on the spot. Very helpful and good overall.
5,Great teacher one of my favorites and shes hot too
5,She is a good teacher. Caring and dedicated. Hot very hot
4,She is a very helpful teacher  but she is extremely slow grading papers. Her tests are very hard  all grammar. Good teacher but way to slow in grading and letting you know your grades.
5,very patient for those of us who were not good at grammar
5,She is extremely nice but she expects you to know your stuff! Her tests are very hard and if you don't know how to write an essay before you take her class  you will fail! She will help you in any way she can but be prepared to WRITE and read boring stories like Oedipus Rex & Othello. Hard but good
5,Mrs. Knous  is a wonderful teacher  she is very helpful and caring. If you put forth the effort she will help you all she can and you will learn. There is not another English teacher at AC I would even concider sitting under.
5,Wonderful teacher! Smart  friendly  and helpful!Kinda hard at first but if you make an effort you can do great and learn a ton from her! I wish she had ENGL 1302 in the classroom. It would probably help a lot of students!!!
1.5,Should have taken another course. Not helpful. Not relevant. Ideas are absurd. Content useless.
4.5,ANTH of Outer Space is possibly the best class I've had. Denning is an absolute delight! She is extremely quick-witted and can talk at length without putting everyone to sleep. Granted  I was very keenly interested in the content to start with. She's thought-provoking and funny. Her teaching style is casual but effective.
5,She is amazing. Her wealth of knowledge is limitless. She is an inspiration in every aspect of life. I want to take every class she has every taught. She's awesome. Honestly. Doesn't like technology though. And she's still busy writing the book on the subject.
5,One of the best professors at York. She's extremely intelligent  passionate  and beautiful. She is also very nice  helpful and understanding. She gives the best lectures at York. There are a lot of readings  but its not necessary to do them all  and it's not hard to get an A.
4.5,the most passionate prof's I've had at York. She loves what she does. Must read the text  really interesting. Fair marker. Museum assignment is time consuming but great. She uses videos for some of her lectures and everything she covers in lecture is posted. Study  read text do reflections and assign  and u'll do well
4.5,Great Professor - interesting course - but then we are left with no grades at all for any work from the year - then we find that we get an NGR (no grade reported) followed by a NGR F. For all of us that are to graduate in a few weeks  we are stressed and freaking out.
4,Very dynamic teacher!
5,We had her as a guest lecturer for NATS1880 - Life Beyond Earth. She has a great personality that just makes you smile. She is a great speaker  full of energy and very enthusiastic!!
5,Only anthropology class I've ever taken  and I genuinely look forward to it every week. She keeps lectures interesting  is extremely personable  and really knows her stuff.
4.5,Great prof and probably the best prof I had this year. Assignments were easy and her instructions were easy to follow. Her lectures are always interesting and insightful. The best feature of this course is the ROM assignment!
5,AMAZING PROFESSOR...SHE REALLY HELPS YOU SUCCEED AND HER CLASSES ARE VERY INTERESTING!
5,She is an amazing lecturer and I love going to class. She keeps the class very interesting and the lectures are very informative and fun. She keeps the students engaged all the time. Overall if you are going to take a class in which she is teaching will not want to drop the class it's going to be super awesome and you will learn. She's amazing.
5,Took ANTH 2140 with her last term  and definitely one of the best profs I've had. She is so passionate about the subject it makes us all excited about it too. She covers the textbook very well and is still able to pull in other interesting facts and stories without getting sidetracked. Lectures were 2hrs long  but I never once looked at the time.
4.5,The BEST prof I've ever had! never seen anyone being so passionate about the subject. She is very very helpful and really cares about her students:) The course involves a lot of readings but her lectures are incredible and really interesting which helps a lot :)
4.5,really awesome prof. she's really fun and really engages the entire class with the course material. she makes more of a discussion-type environment than a classroom  and is more of a friendly classmate as opposed to a professor. the class was really interesting  but a lot of reading. she is really clear on what she wants you to do. take her classes
4,The class was interested I have to admit..learned some new things  and the professor is very passionate and energetic. I normally would not complain about the amount of reading in upper year courses  but she assignmed 100 pages + per week and almost NEVER discussed them in class. Also the poster party..honestly I felt like I was in grade 5 again.
5,AMAZING PROF! Her course was informative and fun! She is very clear with the requirements of the course and what is expected. She incorporates videos  discussions  visuals in her lecture. Class just flew by. Just do your work  attend class  and you'll do great! She is also very helpful with the final essay. Ask her for help and she's there!
5,An amazing professor. Very energetic and obviously passionate about the course. Lectures are nearly always very interesting. She knows how to interact well with students  and seems very approachable. Gives very clear guidelines for quizzes. A lot of reading though  and lectures don't always touch on them much. Museum assignment is interesting.
4.5,Without a doubt the best prof I've had at University. Yes  there's a lot to read  but it's typical third year reading load  so I wouldn't complain. Her lectures were insightful  informal and a lot of fun. She's great to talk to about the course material during office hours  even if you understand it already. I wish I could take the course again.
5,great prof! she's energetic and imaginative  i think she could make any lecture bearable if not outright enjoyable.
4.5,Hard grader  but her comments are very helpful. Very friendly and approachable. Lots of reading and critical analysis of the text. Took the class during summer and had to write 3 papers  no midterms  and a fairly difficult final. Lots of in-class writing. I would recommend her if you want to improve your writing and analysis skills
5,great! very useful comments and advice
4.5,Bright  coherent lecturer. Grades the essays rather hard but As are attainable. Readily available and extremely helpful during OHs.
5,"Besides the essay class  I attended the ""Cultural StudiesIII-American Satire"" class as well  when Darcy was over in Mainz last year. And I must say that both classes were some of the best I have ever attended. If you consider taking an Essay course  go with Darcy. There is a lot of work to do  but you learn how to use your writing skills. Great!"
5,Darcy was over in Germany  at the Mainz University. Think she was a great teacher and was on one level with the students. Lots of reading  but after all a pretty good class!!
2.5,"Seriously  what a liberal ****. Don't bother taking this class unless you are ready to write endless essays about points that she agrees with. Ignore her when she asks to argue ""your point of view."" If its not hers  you are wrong and you will recieve a bad grade."
4.5,She grades tough on essays  but she's very nice and helpful...liked her class.
5,she is not only hot  she is the bestest english prof ever. i heard that if you do the reading and the writing and have it structually and grammatically correct  you'll get an easy a. i took it and not only was it a cinch  it was interesting too. woe be the peon who doesn't take this class
4.5,I don't know why other people don't love Darcy! She presents tons of civil rights issues  yes  but she's open to any point of view. Good comments on writing  and she's really helpful with developing a thesis  citing works and presenting a strong argument.
1.5,Presents biased views of highly political issues. Spent more time studying anti-war  ****s  pro-flag burning  and same sex marriages with some MLA format stuff. Improving your writing itself... apparently not in this class.
5,This was such a great class. Everyone says that it's like writing boot camp  and at times it was  but it's pretty easy. There are a lot of short reading assignments and 4 essays throughout the quarter. Great teacher who makes it interesting. Goood class.
1.5,I think she's supposed to be teaching high school  not college
4.5,Definitely not an easy class. However  she leaves you with plenty of opportunity to improve. Nice  helpful. Good teacher  but not an easy A class and does involve a lot of writing.
5,No Comments
4.5,Tons of writing  and you have to learn how to make a solid argument. No easy highschool bs. Girls are cute  teacher's cute.
5,Awesome teacher! 100% Recommended!
3.5,He says that a 'B' is a good grade and that a 'C' is not bad  and he believes it. He's friendly and easy to talk to  but just following his advice won't get you an 'A'...you have to go beyond the requirements and defend every point if you want the grade. Also  make sure you speak out in class and be prepared for pop quizzes.
1.5,No Comments
2,In my experience  Dr. Bender was not willing to help out  and when he did try to help me was extremely unclear on every answer he gave me. I've never disliked a professor as much as I dislike him.
3.5,Almost impossible to get an A  but a B is possible with some hard work. If you're gonna say something in class  be prepared to defend it.
4.5,Take Bender if you like to argue your point of view  because he expects you to. He'll try to intimidate you on the first day of class  but honestly  if you take a pro-active stance on your effort in his classes  you will be more than rewarded. If you're willing to learn  he'll teach you a lot.
2,out to get you. If he doesn't like the topics of your papers you might as well give up!
4.5,Bender is awesome if you love to argue. He definitely makes you work for your grade  but it's worth it  and A's are possible. He's a great prof and more than willing to help you out.
4,Dr. Bender is extremely hard! But the things you learn from his class are incredibly valuable.
3,class is hard  but he teaches valuable info  worked hard to get a B but feel better about my writing skills
2.5,hard  but his work does have a purpose  brace yourself that c.
1,Hated him......
2.5,I didn't enjoy his lectures. I often felt that they had nothing to do with the subject matter. And  although some of his assignments were challenging in a good way  I felt that they had nothing to do with the class that I signed up for.
5,Great guy who cares about his job. More than willing to help. Class is difficult  but you will learn a great deal from him. Be prepared to defend your opinion.
3.5,He is so funny and a lot of fun. I loved being in his class because he was nice and helpful. He is willing to work with you if something happens and you cant get your stuff done. He is a great guy  but beware of the first day of class ...its interesting:)
2.5,he doesn't really care about grades. He judges you from first meeting and desides your grade then no matter your ability. Be prepared for a C
4,Good guy. Respects your opinion. Semi-hard to get an A but just take your B and move on.
2.5,No Comments
2.5,Make sure everything is turned in correctly  you will not pass if you accadintally forget something  I heard that she is great if you go and talk to her in person  but she does not understand how to use technology in the least. She will give zeroes if she feels need  and even if she dosen't.
2,Not a good instructor. He has a superiority complex. Makes tests harder than textbook content. Grades more harshly as semester progresses. Steer clear of this one!
4,I expected him to be hard  but he is really clear about what he wants and if you just do what you are supposed to  you will make a good grade. I HATE public speaking  but he made it not so bad. I notice that everyone who ranks him poorly is a poor speller/writer. Maybe they had problems in his class because they just weren't very bright.
4,Lots of assignments but most only require 20-30min of your time  very easy! Only 2 tests and then the Final. Both test are open book. The only way you will not receieve a good grade is if you just dont turn anything in. Very nice and helpful.
3.5,This is a difficult class as far as grading. There is a lot of homework assignments  none of which are hard  just time consuming. The open book tests can be challenging yet you know what you will be doing well in advance. This class is what you make it. PREPARE TO WORK.
3.5,His class isn't really that hard.. we did 5 speeches.. all test were open book & the final is very easy.. he always opens the very first class with a magic trick:) he is a very monotone person.. you can get away with missing a few classes but if you dont wanna read the book then dont miss class! he says to read but i never did & I still passed!
2.5,Mr. Wilkerson is an experienced and almost overqualified teacher. Be cautious when you take him  his class is hard with a heavy schedule. He's a vulture about texting  and he doesn't know how to respond to public criticism. This class is his life and he expects it to be yours so be prepared.
2,For a speech teacher the class is extremely boring and monotone. After all isn't main point of public speaking is keeping your audiences attention. If you can not do this how does he think he can teach you to do it.
3.5,i took him for speech and we wrote like 6 or 7 speeches all tests are from the book  he grades real hard and if you have a heavy schedule don't take him  he gives out lots of work.
2.5,He was not an easy teacher! But I still pulled an A. You have to practice  practice for your speeches! Tests are all open book so that was nice. Final was an essay.
2.5,He'll open the first class with a magic trick...lol. Pays close attention to detail and repeats things a lot. It gets old fast  but the work isn't very hard.
4,Extremely easy  all notes given on overhead. Outline provided to follow for speaches. Tests are open book and the final was an essay that you got to do at home. Graded fairly  all in all an easy A.
3,He is a difficult teacher  grades tough  alot of writing in this class. Like the class  not crazy about teaching style.
1.5,If you ask a question he will look at you like you are stupid. Lectures have no relations to the tests. Tests cover huge amounts of info. LOTS of assignments. DO NOT take this class if you have a hefty schedule. No matter how good you think you may have done on an assaignment  it is not good enough. His grades will TICK YOU OFF!!
1,one of the worst professors at this school
2,Very unclear in lecture out of 5 classes he only had 2 As WILL NEVER TAKE AGAIN!!!!!
2,Hard teacher gets off track in lecture  if you are female you will get a good grade.
1,SPCH 1318
4.5,I took him for speech and interpersonal communication. The interp. class was harder than the speech  but I did well in both. Be prepared to work  he is very helpful when you ask for it. I enjoyed his classes and learned a lot. If want to learn  he is the one to take.
1,Exams cover terms theories and include essay analysis questions. Essays are assigned for homework that apply theory to events in your personal life. Graded on content clarity and insight. Oral presentations on assignments are shared with class.
5,Great teacher! Very helpful and cares about her students. She gives assignments that are worthwhile to class.
5,great teacher. if you go to class and take notes she outlines the assignments extremely clearly to make them easy to write. dont really need the book  if you have an a at the end of the class you don't need to take the final!
5,Go to class and pay attention she wants you to do good and will always help you out. Just make sure to do all your work and you will get a good grade.
4,If you pay attention to carol you will learn a lot and get a good grade.
5,A lot of work  but very helpful.
3.5,she is a good teacher  class is structured  quite a bit of work but as long as you stay on top of your assignments you will be good. She is anal about attentance
5,Sort of hard  but very good.

3,"Very particular person to paragraph and sentence structure. ""Attendance"" is almost mandatory w/ her. ""Assigned Seating"" must sit in assigned seat only. Can't eat in class  doesn't like when you walk out of class. I don't recommend unle"

4,Intro to psych was easy. She doesn't put her powerpoints online so don't skip class. Make sure to study notes AND book bc she puts questions on the exams that we didn't cover In class.
3.5,"Dr. Asplin is really knowledgeable and is good at explaining tough material. She is a great resource of information for psych students especially. She can come across as very serious at times  but she's also very laid-back and forthcoming about her expectations. Attend class regularly because she really helps you to ""get"" the material. Do the h.w.!"
3,Attendance is absolutely mandatory. She does not put the power points online which kind of stinks. Her tests are hard  and require a lot of studying. Nice lady though.
5,SHE IS AMAZING. Honestly  the most intelligent and realistic professor I have had. She is so smart and funny  I actually couldn't wait for class. She is so interesting and helpful  I will take her every chance I get!!! Love her!
5,Dr. Asplin has to be one of the best professors at UPG. She is a wonderful professor and cares about her students. Dr. Asplin even cares about her students outside of her classroom and is easily accessible to her students. I am glad I took her for classes while I attended Pitt Greensburg. She was helpful when I took this course.
5,Personally  with most psychology classes I forget the material after a semester  but I feel Dr. Asplin's class if very different. She made the topic very interesting. Even though my class was 2.5 hours long  it didnt seem it at all! Definitely take this class. Dr. Asplin is so nice and very direct about what she wants.
5,One of the best professors to pick up as a Freshman. She understands kids  and she is a very good teacher who makes psychology interesting.
4,I really enjoyed this class! Professor Asplin is super clear when speaking and a lot of the exams come from the power points. It is important to read the book though  because material is used from there too. Overall this class was informative and not hard!
5,I love her! She keeps all of her students engaged in what they're learning  and she's SO funny. Definitely one of my favorite professors. Do everything you can to take her! She grades papers super easily  and doesn't give a lot of tedious work. But don't buy the textbook. I have never used mine.
4.5,She is a very educated woman. She knows what she is talking about. Her tests are pretty difficult  but she gives projects that boosts your grades a lot. If you go to class and take decent notes  it is not hard to earn at least a B.
5,Nothing negative to say about her  one of my favorite professors at UPG. Love working with her and highly recommend her! Lectures are crystal clear and she's lenient about meeting up to get help. Actually enjoys her job!
3.5,Don't buy the book because she basically only grades you on what's discussed in class. Attendance isn't mandatory but in-class worksheets are random and count for a grade. I didn't like how few grades there were
5,easy easy easy... if you fail this class it is simply because you really did not try. You could fail every test  never go to class and get As on all the projects and pass with a solid C.... i know this because i did it
1.5,Powerpoint reader. This professor makes absolutely zero effort to take what is clearly student's collective ignorance/lack of knowledge and turn it into a forum for active discussion or a lesson. Instead  keeps on keepin' on with the stupid powerpoints that come along with the book she made us waste $180 on. Based on this  worst prof. i've ever had
4.5,Good class  hard tests easy projects. Lets you pick your 4 best tests out of 5. Projects are fun and enjoyable. I would recommend this class/professor.
4.5,The lectures are enjoyable  the projects and papers are easy  and the exams are reasonable. Honestly  the only bad thing I can think of saying is that she made us buy an expensive book that I've barely used. She seems to really care about her classes.
5,Enjoyable classes
5,One of the most helpful and knowledgeable professors I have ever had in college. Very clear and extremely helpful. You can tell she's not there for just a paycheck  but sincerely cares about helping students understand the material. Super busy on campus  but will make time for you. Attendance is mandatory.
4.5,One of the better professors this campus has. I can actually remember some of the material that we went over  which I took over a year ago. Effective teacher who was energetic  clear  interesting lessons  neat assignments. Highly recommended class and professor.
5,I don't like classes at small campuses where they cram like 60 students into a lecture hall. However  for managing such a big class  Asplin really cares about her students and that they do well. She's not always in her office during hours  but she's more than willing to meet with you. Do the reading  write the papers  come to class - you'll pass!
5,Kate doesn't care what anyone thinks and it's awesome. She a feminist and Buddhist with very strong political opinions she won't see for herself. Class discussions are always fun  If you have a problem with other people's opinions don't take her classes.
5,Dr. Greene is an excellent professor! She is very opiniated  but she can defend every single one of her views with facts  statistics  etc. Also  if you have a different view  she will let you share with the class because she encourages debate. She will not treat you any differently if you have a different opinion. Do your readings and you will pass
1,She lectures from a piece of paper  does not write anything on the board. Most importantly she very rude and creates a hostile learning environment. she do not care about any of your other classes because she makes it very clear that her class is more important than your others. she is just very unprofessional.
4,Not much homework  all test are written response  but she give awesome test reviews. If you come to class you will pass.
5,I highly recommend this professor! She is intelligent and cares about her students very much. I loved her class the most out of all of my political science courses so far. Be prepared to read everything though  and to work for your grade. The tests aren't too bad if you read all of the material and keep up with your assignments.
4.5,This was such a great class. I learned a lot and it was really easy to pass as long as you showed up and you did the work. She doesn't ask a lot of students. There is a 15-20 page paper so beware of that if you decide to take her class.
3,I do not remember the course code  but the course was a 300 level and was intro to american legal systems. She was very cool and down to earth. She is not one of the professors who think that because they have a degree  they are better than you. Although the note taking can be confusing at times  she is magnetic and I would recommend to anyone.
4,"A class with Kate should be compulsory. She will expand your mind and educate you with skills and knowledge that will reach far beyond the classroom. Her ""Women and Politics"" class was my favorite during my time at USM. I carry the lessons learned with me in my life. Kate Greene: educator  teacher  inspiration."
4.5,I find Dr. Greene's ability to connect with her students refreshing. Engaging lectures  and constant feedback with her audience. She is obviously passionate about education. The drawback is that note taking on lectures is difficult. The material is based on the ongoing changes in the legal and social society  textbooks are fairly irrelevant.
5,Dr. Greene is probably the most awesome teacher I've had my whole life. She is unapologetic about her views and she has no problem telling you why she feels the way she does with facts  stats  and history. Here in MS  it's such a refresher to see someone push back with the norm here and really make their students think. So thankful for her !!
3.5,Interesting class. She's frequently in spats with the Uni President and teaches from her perspective as a lesbian feminist. Excellent for learning about civil liberties in constitutional law.
3,Dr.Greene is my favorite teacher at USM so far. She really makes you think from a different perspective. She is very opinionated  and not afraid to tell you hers. Same as all of the other comments do NOT make her mad!
4,Liberal feminist teaching in one of the most Conservative places in the country. She is interesting and if you OPEN YOUR MIND you will leave enlightened and changed. Unapologetic  and sometimes frightening. She is serious but has a good sense of humor. Class consists of powerpoints  lecture and note taking. Easy class IF you pay attention.
4.5,Kate teaches political science from a liberal point of view in one of the most conservative places on the planet. As such she gets a lot of resistance from her students. But if you go in with an open mind  you will emerge enlightened
1,No comment
3,She's really funny  but we don't get much done in class. Memorize lecture notes and google keywords for essay fluffing. As a person  she feels and believes-- heart on her sleeve sort. Very approachable  sorta boyish and grumpy but she smiles.
5,Kate is a wonderful teacher who challenged me more than any teacher I ever had. ANY detractors are simply weak in intelligence and tolerance. Any person who is a true scholar would love her classes.
4.5,Great teacher but makes no apologies for anything that comes out of her mouth.If you are offended easily don't take her class. I would also not piss her off. Even though she is one that you can joke with  take her seriously when she begins to warn you. The whole class will feel her rath if angered.
5,I have taken several classes from Kate and she's fabulous. She's controversial  unapologetic  and constantly challenges her students to *really* think instead of regurgitating information.

5,Best instructor ever! Be prepared to work  work  work. If you do  and you listen and take criticism  the world is yours. Carey will prepare you for anything. Although her classes are 3 hrs/day 2/wk if you come prepared and show initiative you can usually be let go to work on your own. She will allow you to succeed on your own if you can.
5,"Very helpful as long as you ask  deadlines are expected to be met or the class can ""fire"" you as an illustrator. Expect to work outside of class & have good technique  learn a lot by end of class. Usually doesn't make you stay all class period except for critiques  good effort = good grade."
5,Such an amazing professor. She really knows who is going to make it and who isn't in the real world. Also  gives great advise on how to showcase your portfolio. I would recommend her to anyone.
4.5,"She brought the 'high-end'-ness to what design is rather than coming off as a typical ""can't cut it in the real-world' type of stigma a professor can get in this industry."
2.5,"Everyone else seems to love this woman but me! I do have a little bitterness towards her though because (as my advisor) she told me not to pursue GD anymore because ""I can't draw."" While anyone who knows me thinks my drawings are actually really good! I guess she is just looking for prodigies!"

4.5,Carey is a great instructor...she is very helpful in getting ideas started. Deadlines are deadlines though  you have to be dedicated to your work and get your projects in on time  especially for critiques. Se is defintely an excellent instructor!!
3.5,She teaches all levels of Illustration. On the lower level courses she is pretty easy on students just as long as they get their work done by deadlines. On the upper level  she is a bit more demanding of high quality work  which in the end is a good thing
1.5,This class is hard. You will put in 3-4 hours of hw  and this must be done right since it is graded. Oh and you will be doing this blind  with no prior guidance. Class tries to cover too much material which never gets tested away.
4,Materials are always explained after the homework for that section is turned in.
4.5,If you're majoring in Accouting at Case  you won't be able to avoid Pearson. He's a great professor. It's a shame there aren't more like him. Gives way too much homework.

2.5,Chris is a thoughtful  and conscientious professor. He's not always exactly crystal clear with his instructions  but if you have an I.Q. higher than that of an earthworm you can usually figure out what he's talking about  and if you have questions just ask him  he's really approachable. He expects a lot out of you  and that's a good thing.
3.5,"He knows his stuff and has a high skill level. When it comes to talking to people though  he is way too delicate. He'll hem and haw for an hour instead of just saying  ""That looks bad  let me tell you why..."" But when you coax it out of him  his insights and feedback are invaluable. You'll gain more skill in this class than in most  of any subject."
5,I love Chris! He is super nice and really wants to help you. His class is easy if you actually work hard  I've never had to work after hours or anything. He helps you even if you ask him the same question a million times. He seems genuinely concerned about you. He'll help you through any issues you have. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! :)
5,Chris is a super nice guy and a great teacher. He is really fun but still wants you to learn at the same time. I would reccommend him to anyone!
3.5,I think he was a great teacher. He was arrogant and some say gay. I had a crush on him...why I have no idea.
1,More of a **** than an educator ... Watch out!r Self-indulging artist
2,Artist seems most interested in himself more than the students.
5,Great! Creative and engaging instructor.

3,Overall  he's just fine. He seems to push his political stance on students every chance he gets and argues with students when they don't agree with him. After a while I stopped attending class and still got 100%. If you turn your papers in he will give you the credit and probably not even read them. Its more graded on completion than anything else.
5,David is awesome and funny! He might be retiring soon so he is slacking off on harsh grading/number of assignments. He uses many ways of teaching. Videos  lectures  acting something out  etc. Its a history class so expect it to be kinda boring.
5,Prepare for a lot of writing. David is an excellent professor  and is very dedicated to the teaching profession.
5,I usually dont rate professors on here  but I felt like I needed to let people know that David rayson is possibly the best professor you will probably ever come across in your life. You can turn in assignments whenever is most convenient for you  even after semester is over. You can also revise every assignment as many times as you want.
3,David is a good professor. The best part of his classes are that there is no penalty for turning in late assignments and that attendance is optional  but I would recommend going to his lectures for further information. Lots of readings and essays to write. It was a good class.
2,David is a really nice guy and does want you to do well. But  -He is late just about everyday. -During his lectures he jumps all over the place and it is hard to follow
5,David really cares about his students and their success. He does require lots of reading  but it is all very interesting. If you love history you like this class. He does have lots of papers but most of them are 1 page papers. He has options to do service learning or outside learning for extra credit and allows revisions of papers. Amazing teacher!
5,He's very understanding and an overall great person. He cares for the students
5,I loved David's class. Ancient history usually isn't my thing  but he found subjects that could spark students interest. He is very supportive of his students  and occasionally goes on little rants about how WE are in charge of our education  not the other way around  and actually told us to come here to do research on our professors. Really great!
5,great guy who understands what students go through and tries to make it easier on students by helping them with the workload and due dates.
5,Great guy... Lets you turn in papers whenever it is convenient for you-- really cares about his students.
5,Dr. Rayson was  by far the best professor I had in my time at Normandale. He is truly inspired me to do better in each assignment i handed in. His tests are essays in which you will know about weeks in advance. He allows revisions to these essays until you get the grade you want. I highly recomend this instructor to anyone.
5,I was not a history major  but I took 3 classes with David due to his ability to engage and inspire all of those in his presence. His experience and wisdom are so profound that I always left each class feeling empowered  and more compassionate. He's the best of the best. I highly recommend him to any student.
5,Take him he's an amazing teacher. I got an A and did moderate work. You also learn a lot from him. Like others said he is funny too and has a good personality.
4,there are no tests in his class  only papers  but they are weekly. He is very spontaneous and funny in class and some of the movies he shows are good. Attendance is very loose and extra credit is very easy to get and there are lots of opportunities for it. He's also a very easy grader as long as you make all the points he wants to hear in papers
4,David was easily the best professor I've ever had. He's hilarious and kind. You can make up any assignment he ever assigns without penalty. He's so wise  I could listen to him talk for hours. If you need a history credit and aren't into history (even if you are) this is your guy. Take a class with Rayson and you won't be disappointed.
4,Super funny and nice guy. His class is pretty easy and you can retake your assignments.
5,A caring  loving  easy going  and funny/ He is by far a great teachers there no way to fail his class no WAY............
5,He's a great professor. He gives good feedback. The class was very interesting.
4.5,I'm taken his next semester for TWO different classes. No test  and lot of movies. He is Great  lay back over all a very good teachers. You will not fail
5,He is fascinated by what he teaches and it actually inspired me to learn - not many teachers can do that. He really cares about his students. Asks us questions to make sure he is teaching the subject well enough. One of my favourite professors.
3.5,Nice guy and amazing lecturer (certainly knows his McLuhan). However between the take home exams and essay you are ending up writing A LOT (certainly more than any other poli sci lecture or seminar)
5,My favorite UVic prof. I still read ctheory  and I graduated 3 years ago.
3,He is definately brilliant when it comes to technoculture and post-modernism and gives you a new perspective but I had a hard time following the material - put a lot of work into my papers for mediocre marks. Not an easy class  but fresh and new.
4,Kroker is a breath of fresh in the Uvic poli sci dept. However  I found him to be dogmatic in his insistance on post-modernism/humanism as the only legitimate type of study. Anyone who wants to be challenged should seek him out  but NOT for an easy A.
3.5,brilliant mind. Very respected technoculture scholar. Tough marker. Super interesting and inspiring lectures. An honor to have been in his class. Wished i liked cyberculture a bit more though... The contents were hard to graps concretely...
5,Can't say enough good things about him ... great teacher  not easy to grasp - but very inspiring. Respectful of his students  open-minded  tolerant. In sum: best teacher I've ever had ! Take a class with him  if you want to expand your horizons. =)
4,Cool class
2.5,Very very smart and knows the po-mo world of cyberculture intimately. Rightly considered the successor to Marshal McLuhan. However class ends up being mostly fun coffee cafe intellectual masterbastion. Needs some meat in the lectures.
4.5,Professor Tarkow makes any topic interesting. I had him for two separate classes  and it was obvious that he really cares about his students and his classes. He can explain any concept and make it easy to understand  but he also pushes you to discover things for yourself. You get out what you put in  so definitely do the required readings.
5,Ted - He's a legend. The man is hilarious and an amazing story teller. Struggled with his essays  but he was always willing to help. Got to that final ready to ace it! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. He's great!
4.5,One of the greatest professors you'll ever have. I took Ancient World with him  a class that I wasn't particularly interested in  but he made it relevant and interesting. I would've loved a higher grade but I don't regret taking it b/c he's an awesome person to know (Dean of Arts & Sciences) and REALLY cares about his students. Take his class!
4.5,Tarkow is the best professor I've had at Mizzou. He's really funny and is very open to different ideas and interpretations. He is a relatively harsh grader  but if you do the work and pay attention in class  you should be fine.
4,Taking Greek Classics in Translation with him. Super fun teacher. Mostly lectures  with some discussion. Interesting. Fair grader.
3.5,he doesnt use blackboard  or powerpoints  and is pretty hard to follow while taking notes. you kinda have to adapt to his style.
5,One of the greatest teachers I have ever had. Tarkow is able to take student's comments at the beginning of class  and weave his lecture around those points. The discussion is always deep  but never tangential. He has a wonderful classroom presence. He's a picky grader  but he gives you all the tools in class you could ever need to do well.
4,Tarkow is a great guy. Some of his jokes get a little old after a while  especially his comparisons to Wal-Mart and MU sports teams. Eager to help and enjoys what he does.
4.5,No Comments
5,the best professor i've had so far - makes mythology fun and easy to remember. i will never forget the voices!
4.5,He's really a nice guy  someone you feel comfortable chatting with and going to with concerns about the class. It's definitely not an easy class though  myth. contains a lot of information and it takes a lot of studying time to be successful on his exams.
5,Tarkow is hilarous and tells jokes that are actually funny. Extremely personable. His summaries of myths are incredibly good  and he knows a crazy amount. The tests are fairly easy if you are willing to study. I highly suggest his classes.
5,Ted Tarkow: The Man  The Myth  The Legend. He is seriously the single best professor I've EVER seen. Uses humor  acting  and craziness to help ANY student learn the material. Ted Tarkow is THE MAN!
4,Professor Smith will make you work for an A  but it IS achievable! Stay ahead with your papers  writing a paper the night before will not cut it. The worst thing you can do to yourself is skip his class. Pop quizzes are frequent  but easy if you take notes when he lectures and review them!! Put in the work  you will do great!
1,Difficult an inaccessible teacher. He is one of the teachers that don't care about students. mean and inconsiderate. very boring lectures  stupid quizzes. Find another teacher if you can!
1,To save yourself do not take this class. Max is like a robot and his lectures are boring. He gives pop quizzes  which stinks  and he only grades your grammar and punctuation. He also does not give good feedback  and is unorganized. If he mixes up your papers with another class you will get an F on that paper. For your own good  DO NOT TAKE HIM!!!!!
4,I don't know why everyone else is complaining so much about this class. It is a very easy A. If you show up and do your homework you will pass. He is a very easy grader if you have basic writing skills (or just check your grammar with Grammarly). His class is incredibly boring though and there are daily quizzes (very easy though).
3,I had Smith for freshmen composition. He was a decent teacher  but one thing I noticed was he didnt really care about the writing aspect of your paper. As long as the grammar was near perfect you got an A. Also the quizzes he gives are stupid and basically re worded from the last quiz. Good thing they only make up 10%. Also dont miss class.
1,In my opinion he doesn't have a good way of teaching. He always quizzes you on grammar. He doesn't show any powerpoint or examples. And most of the time he spends the class time talking about things that aren't even related to anything in class  he always releases you early. He's one of those teachers that seem not to care.
1,It seems that when it comes to papers this professor doesn't care much about the writing. Instead he cares more on the punctuation. His quizzes are random and repeated. His lectures don't relate much to actually English.
5,Smith is a very unemotional/robotic professor. He is a decent English professor  but he expects professionalism out of his students. There are pop quizzes at least twice a week  but they are always very easy. Do not get caught procrastinating on your papers because he catches small mistakes very easily.
1,simply the worst professor I've ever had  doesn't care for students  gives little to no sympathy what so ever  hard to talk to  and just not a nice guy. I recommend not taking this class  he is a tough grader  does meaningless quizzes
3,Daily attendance. Grades aren't posted  so your grade is unknown till the end. Make sure you listen closely to lectures and take detailed notes. 2-3 quizzes a week. He spends class time talking about different essay topics instead of essay writing techniques/strategies  but if you work hard and follow his instructions closely  an A is attainable.
2,"He refused to put any grades in the grade book. I had no other errors in my papers  except him writing ""confusing"" next to seemingly random sentences in my paper  somehow warranting me with a C grade on most papers. English has always been my strongest subject  and I usually ace papers. Not with this guy. Miss a peer editing day? 0 on that paper."
1,this teacher has no type of personality. His lectures are boring. He is not clear about what the assignments are going to be about. He is very unorganized. He doesn't care for his students. Attendance is a must. HE IS A HORRIBLE TEACHER. The whole class received no higher than a C. Avoid this class.
3,"Definitely not an easy ""A""  but it is possible. Total of 8 Essays including the final the essay. There are pop quizzes but if you attend class they're not too bad. Attendance is absolutely mandatory! 6 absences and your grade will drop a whole letter  and there are no excuses  Smith isn't very understanding. Try toFind a different prof. if you can!"
3,"I'm torn about this professor. There was a distinct rudeness from him at times that was very degrading and stand-offish. I want to maybe believe he is too intelligent to communicate with people of regular emotion? At times he was understanding  other times I felt his subtext was saying ""You are an idiot and I am more intelligent than you."""
1,This is the single worst teacher I have ever had in any of my years of schooling. His criteria for grading is not well done but if you stray from what he wants you will lost points heavily. Extremely strict on grading and doesn't bother putting logic together about why you did what you did. Extremely lazy and very bad feedback on your errors.
1,This is the only professor I've had that refuses to put grades in the gradebook. I am paying a lot of money for his class so it is lazy of him to not simply do something nice for his students. He is hard to talk to  extremely boring  and only does things that are convientent for him. It almost seems as if he can care less about his students.
1,Rude  doesn't like to take correction or be told he is wrong and unfair. I do not recommend this instructor unless you are error free in everything you do.
1,difficult teacher  unless you're an advid writer do not take his class He will not help you even if you ask for it directions can at times be unclear rude when you try to ask something  doesnt like being corrected even if you point a mistake out nicely you can tell he is not inspired to teach anymore  dean refunded me right away without hesitation.
1,Very tough grader. Wants everything done his way. I took this class online and unless you go to his office for every little thing  you get a bad grade  even if you email him. The comments he gives for essays are subjective and demeaning. Would not recommend or take his class again. Took research writing classes at university  they were easier.
1,Do Not take this class. He has no idea how to teach  would talk about random things and is never helpful with the papers. So hard to approach doesn't really care what your asking for. unless you are a professional at writing don't take his class. Has stupid tests every class which are no help.
4.5,he was down to earth and polite. very compassionate toward every student and says hello if he recognizes you around campus. his passion for students is unrivaled among any other professors at OSU
5,learned a lot. :)
5,nice prof. hard work.
5,I absolutely loved this class! I thought Jeff was an excellent teacher  who really knows his stuff! If you are Electronic Media like I am  I'm sure you will love it too!
4.5,i learned a lot in his class.
1,No Comments
5,awsome teacher
5,His class is very tough. It's so far the only class that talked about real world experiences. He can sometimes be moody but overall i think very dedicated to the students. The workload is a lot for non-emphasis area people.
4.5,knows his stuff on typography
3.5,This class was very challenging and sometimes stressful  but we covered a lot of material. I think this professor really tried to bring the best out in us. He also mentors us in a group of student designers to work in the professional world with clients. None of the other professors do that.
1,This lazy  egotistical  unmotivated  sorry excuse for a designer has no business in a classroom. Take as little of his classes as possible  no matter what your focus.
1,I can not believe this man is still teaching. He is a joke. Don't ever ask him a question because he'll barely give you an answer and then make you feel like a complete idiot. They need to get him out of there.
2.5,Jeff is very egotistical and not very involved in the teaching process. He has an ever changing opinion of your work  has an unrealistic expectation in the quantity of work  and has no real structure to his teaching. No lesson plans  no vocab. Only scattered links off the net and videos he bought
1,he is a schmuck/very unhelpful..he knows what he is doing but very negative and wants to scare EVERYone out of the graphic design program!
1,I warn you - DON'T get on his bad side...otherwise you're ruined.
4,Jeff has been in the industry for a while so he has a perspective that many professors don't. He's all about getting students to do better than they think they can with computer graphics and such. Very good teacher overall.
5,PhD Microeconomics
5,Awesome Professor. Funny. Had him for the PHD Micro. Class was very hard  but his teaching was excellent. If you have to start the day with microeconomic theory  this is how you'd want to do it. LOTS of homework.
4.5,This man is wicked smart. Makes econ fun and relevant. Proves you don't have to be an arrogant jerk to be a brilliant success. I hear the intermediate class is hard  the intro class was easy.
5,One of the best profs I've ever had.......
4.5,No Comments
4,Great examples. Smartest member of the Clinton administration.
3,He will help you out when you need it. He confused me on alot of things  but hes a good man. Accounting isn't the easiest thing to teacher...
3.5,He is hard to hear so sit in front. Willing to help you outside of class if you don't understand. Fair  multiple choice tests  grades on a curve. Lets you use one page of notes for test. Hey guys  this is accounting  don't expect it to be fun.
1.5,I really do wish there was some way to pass his class. I worked so incredibly hard and studied like crazy and still got a C. At least he's not mean  but if you take him sit in the front row because he's hard to hear.
1,THIS TEACHER IS SO HARD JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S SAYING AND HE MAKES UP DUMB ACCOUNTING JOKES
1,He really is a bad teacher  even if you try your hardest he will still fail you. He is very hard to understand and work with. If you take him GOOD LUCK!!!
1.5,Absolutely the WORST teach I've EVER had!!! Do NOT take him!!! You can not understand him talk... you are better off teaching yourself the material!!!
1,OMG..DO not take this teacher...he is a old man who just mumbles and can't teach!
5,not a bad prof  lets you use notes on exams
1,No Comments
1,RUN! RUN AS FAR AWAY AS YOU CAN!!!
1.5,Totally boring. You have to go to class to get the handouts  but it's really hard to stay awake.
1.5,Oh my! Worst class I have ever taken. She talks all class about nothing. We received so many handouts which was such a waste of paper...her social process oviously do not represent her so told attitudes. AVOID HER AT ALL COSTS!

1,Social Processes and the Environment
5,Absolutely the best I've ever had. Really cares about his students  will take the time to help you. Not an easy class  but he makes even the most boring stuff interesting and understandable. Excellent!
5,Great teacher. Smart and passionate. Breaks down theories+readings clearly and concisely. Workload seems heavy at first but do-able. His class is worth taking. Would definitely take him again. Also helps that he's easy on the eyes...I sure paid attention!
5,He is an absolutely awesome professor. Everything is in essay format  reading were very interesting. Loved it  would take more classes with him.
5,He is the best professor. The matriel is hard but He is really smart and knows how to teach and make theory class tangable. I came out of his class knowing the matriael inside out. He really cares about his students and is a cutie.
5,Amazing!
4.5,Good professor
5,Jerolmack is the best professor I have had during my four year college career. He is extremely intelligent  always helpful  and provides thorough explanations of abstract ideas. It was a pleasure and a great experience being in the presence of such an innovative teacher. By the way...he is HOT!!
5,Professor Jerolmack is most likely the youngest and brightest professors I have ever had at Hunter. He is extremely bright and very patient with his students. He relates more with the students personally than any other professor I have met. I highly recommend taking his class. READ ALL OF HIS BOOKS.
4.5,very good professor....gives good lectures...offers a lot of help... as long as you do the readings and the assignemnts  you're good... highly recommended
5,AWESOME!
5,BIg up to the selektah massive inside! Rinse out Prof. J-Mack propa...gunshots! boh! boh! maximum Reeespect....
5,Professor Jerolmack is hands down one of the best professors at Hunter! Take his class you won't regret it!!
5,He is the best sociology professor in hunter. He knows his material very well. If you take good notes and read the reading assingments you won't have any difficulties in his class.
4,No Comments
4,he's young  cool  and laid back but knows his stuff
5,Ian is a wonderful professor! He's thoughtful  understanding  and he loves a good class discussion. No quizzes  no test  just two writing assignments and a presentation. He gives great feedback on everything. He sometimes shares food with the class (ask about his walnut paté)  but he never shares the recipes - no matter how often you ask! :)
5,Dr. Ian was one of the best professors Ive had at Eastern Michigan. I would recommend his section to everyone that wants to teach early education. Hes super relatable  funny  and has the most adorable British accent. Absolutely loved this guy.
2,I had Ian in a very large lecture hall. From what others have told me he shines much better in the smaller classroom size. Because of the large size  I did not enjoy his teaching style. It was hard to hear him and I sat in the close half. If you take him  make sure it is is a smaller setting.
5,I've had Ian so many times I've lost count. Genuinely wonderful both as an educator and as a person. Each time I've had him  I've been asked to examine literature in new and impactful ways. Respectful and interested in the opinions of his students. You can't get away with not reading the books  though  so don't try it. He'll know. Highly recommend.
4,He is a solid professor  and has his teaching assistants do most of his work for him. You're graded on a couple quizzes  tests  and papers. It's lecture heavy  but the slides that go with it are pretty informational so if you miss a class or two it won't kill your grade. We read a lot  but they also go in depth about the books.
5,Great Professor. Had him for 207 and again for 455. Great in the big lectures  but try and take a smaller class with him if you can. He's the only professor at Eastern who even bothered to learn my name. Really wants to hear what you have to say. Challenging  but not unfairly so. Highly recommended.
3.5,I love this professor. I'm taking him again in the summer. Totally knowledgeable in his field  but he understands that students are not  and that is why we are in class to begin with. His tests are tough and you'll need to devote some study time to any class with him  but overall he's easy to learn from. A wealth of information. One of the best!
4.5,Loved this professor  easy and right to the point. If you needed anything he was always there.
3,You have to read a lot of books. There are pop quizzes  one research paper  a midterm  and final. He was pretty relaxed with the pop quizzes and let us work with other people. He seems interested in what he is teaching. The lectures could be really boring though.
4.5,This class was very interesting and you have a chance to learn a lot. I recommend this class for all Elementary Education majors.
3.5,He's alright. His lectures are long  and unclear because he tells us to write down random adjectives. I didn't read one of the books  and still passed with an A though. Mid term and final exam  1 research paper  and weekly quizzes. Lecture slides are online.
5,If you actually talk to him he is really sweet! If he knows you from talking with you he will help you out  most of the quizzes are group quizzes and he gives you the answers and extra credit! You have to read a lot but a lot is from the lectures. I would definitely recommend!
2,He is a horrible teacher. Doesn't give good lectures. Rambles on and on. I would never have him as a professor again.
3.5,Dr. Andrews is a great professor  I loved his class! He gives many extra credit opportunities  you just need to read all of the texts to pass.
1,I was expecting this class to be easy  it is not. This is a lecture class  you can expect to have a reading assigned every singe class period and half the time he unclear about what needs to be read. I had multiple quizzes  where the questions were irrelevant to the story that was read. I have to take this class again with a different prof. now
1.5,He seems to be confused in his own lectures. He gives you information then has test on something completely different.
4.5,Love love loved this class. Being a lecture  attendance is not technically mandatory  but I always went. It was enjoyable. Keep ahead on the readings and you will do fine. Dr. Andrews is an awesome professor. Extra credit opportunities.
5,Very interesting class! Very well done with some fun humor thrown in. If you love to read and can read fast  this is certainly a class you'll enjoy. Even if you can't get to the reading on a particular week  sparknotes and whatever else will suffice. Very fun!
4,He made things clear in the class. But if you thought that taking this class would be easy because of childrens books you were wrong. Near the end gets into young adult books (300-500pg) that you read within a week sometime cram 2 in a week. If slow reader do not take. Research paper you should start early 5-6pg. Only 2 test  quiz every week.
3.5,Loved Ian! He is humorous and kind. Will get into conversations with you if you're interested. His class is interesting to attend  I recommend sitting in the front because it's a huge lecture hall. The reading guide is slightly confusing but you can email the TA's everyday and they will clarify. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
5,One of the best in the department.
4,One of the better UVIC Visual Arts profs  informed and less conceited than most in the field. Still somewhat entrenched in certain ideologies but no more than can be expected with most profs. Helpful and humorous  full of insightful comments and suggestions.
3.5,Daniel was a very good teacher. He could have taught more about sculpture  but instead gave us materials and sent us on our way. I would have liked more interaction and instruction in this class  but Daniel was very constructive with his criticism and was genuinely interested in helping his students do well. Pretty good for a foundation class
5,I posted the last comment- Daniel is the only VA full time professor who isn't conceited. There are at least two excellent and grounded sessionals.
5,Daniel is an amazing man and a brilliant teacher. He is the only UVic Visual Arts teacher who is not conceited. Anybody who dislikes him is bitter because he challenged them into understanding themselves. He is ALWAYS available for extra help and goes far out of his way to do so. You MUST take his class if you care at all about learning.
3,I really disliked Daniel for much of the year but in the end - I warmed up to him after realizing that he actually did care about students and wanted them to do well. Class tended to be quite chaotic - which I didn't like- but I think I did some of my best work of the year in his class. A good guy in his heart of hearts....I think.
5,smooth talker  diplomatic  probing  stimulates interest  great conversation. call him on his **** more  a lto goes under the radar b/c it sounds so good...
4.5,i have no interest in sculpture whatsoever  cuz  it's sooo costly but daniel encouraged all of us to do our own thing and he respected all our opinon. although his lectures might be hard to catch onto sometimes  he's a cool guy* but dont expect him to give u a HIGH grade. jus a decent grade will do
4.5,Never had Daniel in art classes but had him once in a critique. He's not easy  going straight to the problem and asking me to defend myself nstantly. I like art teachers that actually tell you what's right and what's wrong.
5,Daniel is the best professor at uvic. I strongly recommend his class. He cares so much about his students. He'll let you do clay in 220...but you have to do it right. You have to want to do contemporary.
5,Daniel is helpful and caring. He really takes pride in the accomplishments of his students. Just for the record - you spell definitely - um - d-e-f-i-n-i-t-e-l-y. Just because we're in the visual arts doesn't mean we have to be illiterate.
1,only had one class with him...he basically mentioned that you couldn't use clay....he didn't feel like it was sculpture...too bad for you...too bad for uvic..you lost a sculpture student...but I will continue with my clay..phew on you!
2.5,i dunno...dart doesnt cross my mind  but theres definiantly an absence of something...go to the open houses if u need help...lwll help u with info....
4,hes pretty good i dont see anything to hate?? although he is a bit busy at times. but tries to help when he can...
5,No Comments
4,Daniel is a great sculpture prof  i dont know where you all get the idea that he isn't  cuz he is. He is so helpful and always has a lot to say and always takes you seriously. Definitly one of my favorite profs.
2,Loves himself way to much and definalty didnt teach me a thing. Dont waste your time he will make you hate sculpture forever.
1,What a dart  can you say pompous idiot? His way or the highway and frankly his way blows! sorry to all the members of daniels fanclub but you went to art school to be creative not to become little dart I mean daniels
3.5,Great professor. Clear on explaining Chem  have to say I learned a lot by taking his class.. I definitely recommend him
4.5,Dr. Ibrahim is a truly a great professor. The material he covers isn't easy but he makes sure that he explains it in a way in which the whole class will understand. Although the homework isn't mandatory  it really helps you grasp the main idea of the material and he also uses it as extra credit towards your final grade! Hard but not impossible!
4,Professor Ibrahim is extremly nice and is understanding. He drops the lowest grade and funny. I would definatly take one of his other classes again. BEST professor ever!! If I were you I'd fight tooth and nail to get into his class. :)
3.5,LOVE this professor! His accent isn't thick at all compared to many other professors I've taken. He's really helpful and tries to make sure everyone understands the problems before moving on. and he's really funny! I would definitely take his class again!
2.5,Awesome Professor! Has a thick accent  could barely understand anything he says  but got used to it after the first week. He teaches well. Drops the lowest test grade. He is one funny dude.
5,Very helpful professor! I took him during summer we were moving pretty fast but he was always concern that everyone get the topics... he also make you participate during class working out problems  and it help alot!!! Use the book is very helpful and it could be the difference from a A to a B! Ooo yea and he is very funny!!!
4.5,i love this man. he is the best chemistry professor. if u hate and dont understand jack sht then take him. he explains really well  gives alot of examples  and doesnt move on until hes sure everybody gets it. the book isnt needed  but it helps cos u do problems off of it and it helps for the exams. hes funny too. great overall!
4.5,He is a cool professor to have and i think he made the class kind of fun. I would recommend him for any class since Dr. Ibrahim i very helpful and will try to give real life examples to chemistry problems.
3,professor is funny! makes class fun
1,Wasn't helpful at all during lab. He was gone from the classroom most of the time. If you need extra help during labs  I don't suggest him. I was glad that the class was finally over.
4.5,he is a good professor  he really explains the material being covered and also he assigns homework which is really helpful when taking the tests  also he helps you at the end of the semester if you need it..
3.5,ok
5,is a good teacher
5,Very  very helpful professor! if you do not understand chem at all  take him. He takes you step by step working out every prob on the board. He has a small accent but very easy to understand. Homework is rare  tests are difficult  but he will definitely help you understand chemistry. I would definitely take him again if I had to.
3,He's an ok lab teacher. The only problem is that he is not around when you need to ask questiones  he is usually in his office working on other classes.
3,Professor Ibrahim is fast paced. His exams are found in the library  previous exams. He does not place much emphasis on homework  little to none. *If you challenge him be prepared to stand your ground
5,No Comments
5,great teacher  he works with you and is very freindly. show up for his class and do his work  and you'll be fine. don't talk while he teaches  doesnt like it at all. i highly recommend him.
3,real hard to understand his english. writes real small and light. reading the book was more helpful. points people out for questions and if you happen to come late to class. won't take him.
5,It was a very enriching experience. It was difficult but the study guides were very helpful.
1,i got a C in the class  but would of got an A+ for knowing she will get fired soon.
1.5,The money I spent for this class should have gone to charity instead of her.
1.5,I felt like I was in a sequel to the Twilight Zone.
3.5,yes  she was fired  had her for 1 semester... very rough classes....lectures had nothing to do with the exams.... read the book and u learn more.... i did learn a lot about budgeting and setting up corporate proposals..... this class had pitfalls  but some mountains. shes gone  so oh well....
2.5,"As all the others say she was lazy and didn't know very much (including the OSI model!) As of Summer 05 she has been ""laid-off"" with a bunch of other staff. Devry is going down hill fast..."
1,Horrible professor  lazy and doesn't have a clue how to teach. Is this the best Devry can do. I wish i had of known about her before hand  then i would not never came to Devry.
1.5,"Someone needs to teach this ""teacher"" how to do her job. She has no concept of how to teach a class well. All be warned  if she comes up as one of your teachers  switch your class fast!! She should definately be given the boot."
1,avoid this professor if you want to learn anything. she wastes most lecture time and gives really poor exams  Too many mistakes and vague ans. Lab is a TOTAL joke. This class would not even be worth taking for free  i am only paying for the grade.
1,One of those so called teachers that wont go away!
1,The professor did not explain the materials properly. Her quizzes were based on a book full of errors and she did not assist anyone in finding the answers. How she can teach at this school and take me money is ludicrous.
1,She has to be the worst professor that I had since I've been here at DeVry. She is definitely a poor excuse for a professor. She is extremely lazy and unreliable  and should not be representing DeVry University. She should be fired!!!! She serve no purpose here besides making students life a living
1,She cannot teach if her life depended on it. Someone else should really try to teach this course. She's a poor excuse for a professor as well as a human being. She makes DeVry look bad. I would have never fathomed that I would encounter such a professor.
1,Hi I'm unknown. This professor should be ashamed for associating herself with humans because she's not.TCM210 is a fun course but this reptile Schubert makes it so impossible to understand what the hell is going on.
1,Does not explain anything. Can be vendictive. Be very nice to her or you will pay. She does not answer questions or offer help via email  claims she cant get it outside of class. Get very frustraited if you don't understand what she is saying.
1,Horrible Teacher. Her Daughter is a reflection of her stupidity.
1,This woman is brain-dead. She gives no help and has admitted she doesnt know what she is teaching. If you tell her she is wrong and prove it she doesnt care. constanly late. blames you if she lost you work or if you have equip problems. MUST BE FIRED!
1,Why is this women a teacher? My guesss is for the paycheck because she clearly has no interest whatsoever in helping anyone. After she stumbles in late  you will sit there for the most confusing 1hr 45min of your life.
1.5,No Comments
2,worst professors in Devry.She lacks teaching skills.There is pretty much no sense in attending the class cause the power presentation handouts is all the teaching that is done.She's always late and stumbles in like she was drinking the whole night before
1,One of the worst teachers I have ever had always late  doesnt know one thing about the topic and loses everything you give her and grades you on if she likes you or not she can care less about the work the student has done
5,Professor Bracken does not deserve the bad rep he gets. He is an amazing professor  not a tough grader at all  just realistic for a 200-level english class. His lectures are very well organized and he provides good feedback on how to improve for your next essays.
3,Interesting class  but super tough and dense material. There was a ton of reading and most of it was difficult to get through. He's a tough marker but fair  and he interacts with the material really well. Not a GPA booster  and I'd avoid if you have an already heavy course-load.
4,SO MANY READINGS  be prepared. Kinda has a thing against undergrads. Tough grader  and very strict on grammar. Incredibly useful info in lectures  but doesn't post anything online so take lots of notes. Great with giving feedback on essays and how to improve. Only test in this course was a midterm take-home assignment. Final is a Research Paper.
3,Hardest english course I've ever taken. The reading load is HEAVY you need Time Management skill or this class will be easy flunk. Lazy writers beware: You will be punished. Worked to the BONE for weeks to obtain a B. You'll learn a lot but if you already have a heavy course load i'd save this class for a term with easier classes. THIS IS HARD AF
3,He's a great lecturer but he doesn't have an email  and doesn't post notes online so be prepped to write your own good notes as he lectures fast. Also I wouldn't be concerned about asking questions in class as he will ignore you. He marks harder than my 300 level profs & doesn't give remarks on how to do better just calls undergrads stupid a lot
5,"You get what you give. Bracken is not afraid to call students out on laziness and his ""honesty"" and high standards seem to unnerve undergrads. However  he's intelligent and well read  and classes are funny and exciting. He doesn't like email and office hours were near nonexistent  but if you've gone to every class  he will make time to talk to you."
4,This was the last class of my degree and certainly one of the best -- if not the best! He's an interesting lecturer. Excellent course material. Puts in the effort to provide helpful written comments. Willing to discuss the readings with students in person after class.
4,Very strict at first but lightens up as the semester goes on. He's a tough but fair grader but gives good feedback to help you improve. He explains the readings and what he expects on the essays if you bother showing up to class. His lectures are dry but have great content.
2.5,Don't let Bracken's personality get in the way of what he's saying
2,He is a very intelligent man  but should NOT be teaching undergrads. On the first day he told us he does not give his e-mail address out to undergrads. He had us (second years) reading Frye's Anatomy of Criticism  among other difficult and dry texts. His feedback on essays had lots of criticism but few suggestions for improving. Avoid him as a prof
5,You should choose to take Professor Bracken's courses because he's one of the few critical minds at the University of Alberta who actually takes a bite out of reality. The only issue is that Professor Bracken is so good at what he does that not only does he make other professors seem unqualified but he also reveals your own skill level.
5,I learned a lot from this course. Definitely the best I've taken at U of A.
2.5,Really likes his theory and expects you to apply it and know it well. Don't get discouraged if he doesn't acknowledge your comments in class  keep asking questions. If you make it through his course  your other classes won't be as hard  definitely worth it
1,Bracken is probably the most difficult english professor I've ever taken. Basically  for an english major he is the barbed wire fence you might want to throw yourself at. His exams are based on a part A and a part B. With three of the initial readings and three of the latter readings. A tip for 309: Know both the conversion experience and the [x].
4,Everything said before is true  he can be arrogant and he does mark ridiculously hard but all for the reason of improvement. My first essay was a C and after taking his feed back and applying it to my writing I improved a whole letter grade. This is university  teachers are not going to hold your hand. He knows his stuff and expects you to work
1.5,This man is the most arrogant and self righteous person I have ever met. Told us on the first day of class that he doesn't assign A's  does not give his email to undergrads because we ask stupid questions  and overall makes you feel belittled. This man should not be teaching 100-level English.
1.5,Definitely a very hard marker. If I had known what the class would be like I would have dropped in immediately. I think he would be better geared to graduate studies  as he clearly dislikes undergrads from his constant criticism of them. Wouldn't give out his email and office hours so after class help was impossible. Excessive amount of readings.
5,Great prof. Clear and concise and knows his stuff.
5,Excellent prof! Take his course. If you put in the effort to improve you will be rewarded. Isn't that exactly what this university thing is about?
1.5,worst prof ever. no one got higher than a B in the class. He told us that the semester would get better as it progressed as long as you applied what you've learned... for the term essay (worth 35%) the class average was a D+. He's the kind of prof that never made it further in his field and is taking his frustration out on his students.
5,Very easy class. Gives lots of reviews and even let us use open note for every quiz/test. Basically just show up  take notes  and talk once in a while and you'll do great.
5,BEST TEACHER EVER! very easy going...makes the class very interesting and makes you feel like you want to be there. Take Her!
5,Great professor....made learning fun. Tough exams  but she explains the material really well. Lot's of fun activities in class.
5,This professor made this class very interesting and fun  never a dull moment.
5,I learned so much from this prof! About my self  family  and relationships. Love the genogram! Best class at DeVry and great teacher!
5,Great prof. Tough exams  so get the text....makes class fun though. Want to major in psych now!
5,Great professor. Kept my interest and made it fun to learn even when the topics were difficult. Take this prof!
1,This is one of the worst professors in DeVry. She doesn?t know how to teach and she is not fair when it comes to grading. Very Bad and inconsiderate  I don?t think she qualify to be teaching at all. All she talks about in class is her personal problems. Don?t take this professor for the class
5,excellent class  a lot of fun.
5,BEST PROFESSOR EVER!!! You can tell she is incredibly passionate about teaching and really wants her students to learn the material. She's incredibly friendly and very approachable  and when I had questions outside of class she was more than willing to help! Take this professor!
4.5,she rocks!
5,Very good teacher. You won't be bored in class. She makes learning fun and easy.
5,Great person with genuine interest in her students. No nonsense  which is defiantly needed at a place like DeVry. Also  wicked booty no matter what age.
5,Great professor. Fun activities that helped me to learn the material. She makes the class interesting!She can also be no nonsense when students try to cheat on exams or hand in other people's work. She's earned my respect.
3,pretty good looking but mad moody.one day stupid nice then some days shes just nasty. alot of tests and no cheating. like a hawk.fun class but not the easiest.
5,Class is easy because teacher is AWSOME! We learn by talking about real life experiences. Prof Finn is very open minded.. She listens to us and learns from us as well. Great personality! The first Exam is standard Multiple Choice  but you can use notes. Final is a short essay and a group Talk show. Fun!!! I loved her class and am saddened its over.
5,One of Devry's best. Keeps class very interesting would def take her again
3,Nice lady  but I didn't learn too much.
5,She rarely teaches Spch275  so I was lucky to get her class. She is a great professor. She made it very easy for us to up to the front and speak. The class was very fun.
5,She is a great prof-to the point in what she wants done and is more than fair
1,me very hard working student & I take things very serious. She is 2 cold and her way is right way. Her thread discussion is plain useless & WASTE of time 4 every1. I would NOT recommend anyone 2 take her. If I ever have her again in my wildest dream  I swear 2 god me going 2 drop out of her class 4 I breath with the same air as she is. I hate her
1.5,honestly in the beginning she seemed like a nice woman  but upon further discovery she was very cold. didnt really answer questions thoroughly. always believed she was correct. not a really exciting class AT ALL.
4.5,While her assignments and readings were a ton of work and boring  overall I found her friendly. She does seem to single students out on the threaded discussions though which is lame  but she still seems to grade fair.
2.5,Strict teacher. Very Picky. Must be exaclty her way. You can not have an opinion. It is wrong if she doesn't agree.
3,tough grader!! her exams are totally off the wall! 80 questions in one hour time including an essay..however  open book..nice lady though!
4,Good teacher  but if she doesn't like you  she'll let you know it. Doesn't put up with any bull  so don't give her any. She will also single out students which I am completely against. Tough grader. -Chior boy
5,good professor~ very helpfull
1,No Comments
3,ehh. not too bad. not too exciting either. projects are a pain.
5,Great professor: everyone complains that he makes you sing and dance if you're late  just don't be late. He definitely broke me out of my shell and made public speaking easier on me. TAKE CHRISTIE! He knows what he's doing and does it so it's fun!
4.5,This professor is a CHALLENGE. This is no easy ride and you should be thankful for that. You learn how to speak publically and debate. Plus  if you're struggling he gives you a chance to pass. There's a lot of feedback and extra credit so there's nearly no excuse to fail. You work for your grade in this class. I love this professor! He's AWESOME!!!
1,He is the worst professor ever!!! He is unfair  and rather talk about his personal life than actually teaching the class. I spent so much time reading  homework  threaded discussions  Q&A   i always completed everthing at 100% and he still gave me grades according to how he felt. He is an awful teacher  dont waste ur time  money and stress by takin
3,Grading was terrible  enough said.
4.5,If you do what he ask of you  you should be fine. I really enjoyed the class  and the people who took the class with me were amazing. Just follow every instruction that he gives and you should be fine. I really enjoyed singing in front of the class.
4,He is a really good teacher. I like the way he teaches  he makes you understand what's going on. I thoroughly enjoyed his class. Just study hard  do what you gotta do and you'll be fine. Don't be late or he'll make you sing in front of the class! All in all  the class was fun  he's pretty funny and cool once you know him better. Grading is alright.
2,This teacher is one of the worst teachers i have ever had. He does not help you  and riducles you when you make a mistake  had to drop this class so it would not effect my GPA BTW: this teacher can not grade. The TDA is total BS if you post 10 times and he will tell you the posts are relevant he will still give you a 50 or 60. WORST TEACHER AVOID A
1.5,Try to avoid taking this professor! YES college is supposed to be challenging. His grading system is ridiculously hard and unconsistent. He is not an understanding professor and his methods of teaching should really change. He needs to learn how to be a good professor. Be prepared to take a test every week in his class.
1,He was a bad teacher mad us feel like we where in 2nd grade. He is useless he makes fun of you when you screw up during a speech
5,This professor is TOUGH. This is no easy ride and you should be thankful for that. You go to school to LEARN and not to just receive a degree. We pay more for our degrees than Rutgers students so we should expect to work for it. You work for it in this class. Love this professor.
1,Prof. Christie takes this class way too serious. If your late expect to sing for the class.
1,he sucks if you have any class with him drop out fast
3,Tough class. If your not a deep thinker this is not the class for you. Be prepared to memorize two books for the tests.
4.5,Prof. Christie is a teacher that really cares about the performance of his students. He insists that you are on time & pay attention in his class. The only people that I have ever heard complain about Christie were the lazy ones who expect to get good grades without doing any work ('cuz no work = poor grades in his class).
4.5,Professor Christie is a good professor. He has an old school mentality  but you learn a lot in his class. If you are lazy  you might as well not take this class. You will be challenged in this class. In the long run  you will feel more confident and your public speaking skills will increase dramatically.
1.5,WARNING! DONT TAKE HIM! Extreamly inconsiderate person  doesn't allow you to go to the bathroom. Treats students like they are in highschool. Makes his class out to be best devry has. I also have to say that I never worked so hard in a devry class to end up with the grade he gave me  his class is an elective for god's sake
4,Fun class  nice professor. But his grading policy is all over the board. No consistency.
5,Comes prepared. Mixes up teaching methods between videos  fun exercises  and 'get to know me' exercises. Very patient. The only bad grades I know he gave out were for people who skipped class. Tests are a bit tricky
4.5,I know that Prof. Christie gets a bad rap from a lot of people but the man is a hardcore instructor who truly gets the best out of students who work hard. Those who want an easy instructor avoid the man. Those who enjoy a challenge  get him.
1,I had him for a humanities class a few years age  he is not an understanding professor. Grades very hard and gives extremely difficult exams......
3,If you want santa to give you a lesson take this class. One of the toughest classes I've taken at UCI only because you have to do lots of work outside of class. He talks to us like we know the material because its trivial to him. There is a lot to memorize. Powerpoints and study guide are useless. Just record lecture. Go to class. Study hard.
1,Test was easy but there's lot to learn though and he seems to do all he can to make learning hard. PPT are ~90 slides each 40% blank (deleted book figures)  the rest are outlines. ditto for study guide. Loves to make new names for things and teaching things not in book. ie He puts z membrane on the study w/ no explaination.. turned out to be z-line
4.5,Class is pretty interesting  but like others have said  he wants to cover way too much. I learned a lot  but that was because I worked hard in the class. One of the hardests classes for a bio major  but also one of the most interesting.
3.5,He wants to cover too much stuff in this class. Because of this  in addition to the lecture material you have to master the bones and muscles without a throrough review in class. Lecture was interesting and fun  but the powerpoint slides arent descriptive and neither is the study guide. Suffice to say i read the book and used wikipedia ALOT =)
2,He is one of the worst prof. at UCI!! He speeds thru lecture notes and doesnt explain anything  the book was the only thing that helped me pass the class  it is pointless to go to lecture because he goes so fast you wont be able to write anything. I did not like him at all. Try to avoid taking this class. It takes alot of time and energy.
2,I personally did not like his teaching style. Powerpoint slides are not very helpful- he just lists key terms! I had to rely heavily on the book because he spoke very quickly in lecture. VERY HELPFUL tip: if you have to take him  make sure you record all lectures  b/c most of his exams are out of what he says in class!!
4,Come on  people! He's agreat professor! He comments about how he can't believe they pay him to teach a subject he loves so much. He isn't easy  but he is certianly fair.
4.5,I learned so much in this class and it helped me in all subsequent classes. I would highly recommend taking it before physiology especially because it is imperative to have a basic understanding of the body before trying to figure out how it works.
5,Riegle is awesome.He has a great interest in relating the material to stuff you learned in other classes.DO THE STUDY GUIDE and you'll do fine.The tests questions are right out of it!In lecture he pretty much tells you the essay question :)
5,What do you expect  people? Human Anatomy is no picnic. Professor Riegle is good. And he looks like Santa Claus  isn't that cool?
5,Professor Riegle is a really great professor-he explains everything clearly and sometimes he can be even funny.I can't understand why those people wrote such negative evaluations.If you stick to the information required in the study guide and do all of the study questions  you will do fine.
1.5,Without a doubt  the worst bio prof I've ever had!
3,Anatomy: Take this class at a community college where you can get lab credit  too! It's a waste of your time to take it with Reigle. If you happen to take his class  pay a lot of attention to detail... MEMORIZE EVERYTHING (slides  notes  etc.)
2,This guy talks too fast  his lecture notes are horrendously  and the class is very poorly organized. He really should go back to that community college he's really from.
1,It would be a major big mistake for anyone who is enrolled in this poor excuse for a professor. He quietly mumbles speedily his lectures as if talking to himself to take up time. Unorganized powerpoint slides. His lectures are like impromptu.
5,"Everything Professor Zoccolillo says is admirable. One of my favorites is  ""It's about living in a world where our lives and our assumptions about each other intersect  and yes  crash  and how we live and love and hurt and hate each other--and ourselves."""
2,fair on grading but tests and exams are not from the lectures........heavy on the textbook...... good lectures tho....
5,Great professor! Very passionate about his work and genuinely cares for his students. His lectures are intriguing and thought-provoking. He has a fun personality  which makes his class all the more enjoyable. There is certainly a lot of writing to do and his tests are challenging. Open NOTES though  but not open book! So pay attention in class!
5,He is the best. His lectures were always interesting  and his assignments were very creative. The term paper assignment was excellent and included a perfectly selected film  which made it very enjoyable. I'll definitely miss his class.
5,I had professor Zoccolilo for the online psyc110 class. He made the class very interesting. He asks questions and gives assignments that get you to thinking. His grading is very fair. I would love to have him for another subject.
4.5,Great guy  really into what he teaches. He actually used ecollege (unlike other professors). Highly recommend him for any class he teaches.
5,I suggest taking his class because he is a fair grader and very HOT HOT HOT.
5,I looked forward to having this class every week. Everything he has to say is interesting and meaningful. The movies he shows for this class are selected with a great deal of research  which is evident by reading his manuscript xe2x80x9cFilm and Psychology.xe2x80x9d This is a class that anyone would xe2x80x9cenjoy.xe2x80x9d
4.5,Always well prepared  entertaining and educational - always learned something and was never bored. Lots of writing assignments but tests are open notes (but hard). Come to class  do the work - you will get an A.
5,Very cool teacher. Quick responses when emaile. great modivator. Interesting topics for discussion. Very open to opinions that dont match his. Top teacher.
3.5,Very knowledgable man. I found his lectures interesting especially when I had him for psychology. Tests are multiple choice. Cool guy who can crack a joke every once in a while.
5,Explains topics very clearly and seems to be knowledgable about psychology. The class was very interesting.
4,I loved his lectures  he made the class and material very interesting.
3,No Comments
3,He takes things a little too serious. After all it is a Technology School. He needs to lighten up a little  and cut the students some slack. I missed one HW and got a B instaed of an A. Very Weak.
4.5,nice guy. lectures are a snooze  but if you study you will do well. requires a term paper. just be ready to do some work. i dont hate him but i'm not in love either.
3,Remains well versed in knowledge but has become burdened with fund raising  out-reach  and departmental issues which occupy a majority of his time instead of teaching.
5,Prof Curry is a great teacher  he knows his material inside and out and will help you with anything. I can say nothing bad about the man. He's one of the best teachers i've ever had.
5,Loved this course and learned sooo much. But how come he never responded to emails???? He's a fun teacher and loves what he does  it shows!! However

5,Whether or not you like him will depend on your style. Dr. B gives a lot of hw and tests frequently. This is actually helpful because you get a lot of opportunities to make corrections to your grade. 7 or 8 tests total  3 of which are in class with a group. He talks a lot and often doesn't finish lecture  so prepare to spend time in the TA help lab
5,Physics is a really hard course because of the department. I don't usually rate my professors  but even though this class was so hard for me  cuz I'm no physics major  he really is one of the greatest professors. He cares about his students. He's brillant He's definitely worth taking the class from. He'll put in extra time outside of lecture!!
5,Taking Physics 105 from anyone else would be a mistake.
5,This class kept me going through the physics major. He made it so fun  and helped us all to understand so well. He cares about his students so thoroughly  and works so hard to help his students want to learn and succeed.
5,Dr. Bergeson is the best professor I've ever had. He's goofy and eccentric and keeps his lectures entertaining  and somehow learned almost all of the names of every student in each of his 150 student classrooms. He teaches the material simply  and tests on what he's taught us in class - nothing came as a surprise  ever. Very accessible.
5,A great professor for a great class! If you do all the work and study sufficiently for the test  it's an easy A. Dr. Bergeson is really good and explaining things and making lecture interesting.
5,Definitely take physics from him  he actually cares about the students and does everything he can to make sure you learn. He also cares about your grade so he doesn't punish you for not knowing how to do everything and gives you several chances to learn. The tests aren't hard just study and do the homework and you'll get a good grade
5,I dreaded Physical Science before the semester started
5,Good if you are prepared to take responsibility for your learning and review a lot outside of class
5,Dr. Bergeson is a fantastic professor  he is able to teach difficult subjects in a gripping way. He cares about his students and knew a substantial amount by name (in a class with 100 students). Lectures are interesting  and despite first appearance  the vigorous testing and homework schedule is actually very manageable.
5,I loved him. He requires 95% for an A  but that's because his teaching style makes it so possible. No curve. He has 8 short quizzes (sometimes in groups) rather than large tests  a few short homeworks per week  and iClicker questions in class that are participation-based. Does everything he knows how in order to help his students truly learn.
4,Solid fella. Science made entertaining!
4,Physical Science is known as a hard course  but taking it from Professor Bergeson made things clearer. Definitely go to a lab because your TA could save your bacon if you don't understand a concept because the 4 midterms rely on concepts that can be applied to different situations Get the book and keep up on readings so things make sense in lecture
4,Professor Bergeson is an entertaining lecturer and his class is set up to help you succeed at physics. You will have to learn some of the material yourself as not everything is covered in lecture. Go to the TA lab if you are stuck
5,Dr. Bergeson is a great professor and lecturer. It was in a large class but still individualized it by letting students ask questions and help with examples. The lectures are based on enhancing the textbook reading  so if you read the book  you'll be great.
2,I clickers  homework every night  test every two weeks  assigned readings that have nothing to do with physics besides justifying his teaching schedule. But he is really passionate. Imagine Vlad the Impaler for gym trainer. You're gonna get results but gonna but it's gonna hurt! You're taking this class because you have to. Don't take Vlad.
3.5,Dr. B is very funny  lectures are entertaining. The material is pretty straight forward  but test (one about every two weeks) can be tough. The homework is primarily calculation based  but tests are mostly conceptual. Don't expect any curve or extra credit. Overall  Dr. is a good professor.
3.5,He's honestly such a sweet guy and genuinely cares about his students  however his tests get more and more difficult as the semester goes on and he seems to be teaching less and less relevant material. Be prepared to do a lot of the learning on your own.
4.5,Dr. Bergeson is amazing! His lectures are entertaining as well as helpful. His tests are pretty tough though  they can have tricky questions  but mostly because they're not very many questions so if you miss a few you end up with a B or C on the test  which ends up dropping your grade. (95+ is an A).
3.5,I am terrible at Physics (I got a B- in Physics 105 from Hess) but I got an A in this class  and it was one of the most accomplishing grades I have ever achieved. He is hilarious and lectures will keep you entertained. I spent almost every day in the physics tutor lab and it paid off. Lectures are only mandatory for attendance (iClicker points).
5,Professor King makes this class easy to pass as long as you do the reading  answer the study guide questions  and take the quizes and final exam (cumulative). There are no lectures for this class.
5,Professor King makes it easy for his students. He gives weekly quizes and one cumulative final exam at the end. There are study guides to help prepare students for the quizes  final exam.
4,Great online class. Good teacher who responded to students' concerns fairly well for being an online class. Class was easy but you had to put in work for the weekly assignments  the reading was interesting  and quizzes were not too hard.
5,This (online) class is extremely easy to get an A in and still manages to be very interesting as the assignments and textbook are well-written and enjoyable. I encourage you to get as much from the course as you can. Dr Guy is very helpful and fast to respond.
5,I took this class online and it was really easy. You read the book  complete the assignment  do a quiz once a week  then the final. Test questions are from the assignments. He is also very responsive if you need help.
4.5,Literally the easiest class you will ever take. Weekly quizzes that are based off of readings  easy to get 100% and the final is all of the quizzes combined...everything is online. Kind of sad he gets paid to teach this class when he doesnt do anything
5,Took class online. Do the study guides and you will have no problem with the quizzes or final. I found the class to be very interesting and I learned a lot about California. The book is outstanding and so was the class.
4,Very nice man. Fair grader  responsive to questions. At first I thought the class would be boring  but it was interesting. Do the study guides!
4.5,This was an online class. There were twice weekly study guides using the text book and interesting websites and twice weekly quizzes  plus the final. Answer all the questions on the study guides and you will have no trouble with the tests. The answers are all easy to find. I found the class interesting and informative.
5,I took his SOSC 301 class online and it was great. It was very straightforward. Everything came from the textbook. It was an easy A for me. And he was always helpful and emailed back right away.
4.5,"Easy if you answer all his study guides. One paper required regarding writing about a national park. Open book/note test and if you answer all the questions on the study guide  you should get an ""A"" in the class"
4.5,This is my 2nd time taking an online class with Mr. King. Every week you read a chapter  look up information online  and take a quiz. There is also a final paper. It's very easy if you do the work  because the quiz questions match the worksheet you complete. The final is taken from the quizzes  so save all your quiz answers in Word and search.
5,Guy lets you know exactly what he expects at the beginning of the semester. His class is structured so well that there are no surprises. You take one quiz every week based on a study guide that he provides weekly. As long as you do well w/ the study guide and quizzes you will do great! Had him for SOSC and got an A  too!
5,Really enjoyed this professor. Very professional demeanor  interesting topics. Fair.
3.5,Easy class but the guy is a complete ass.
3.5,The class was boring and he was boring. Tests weren't hard. Overall  I don't think I have any impression of him.
2.5,Sometimes his tests are easy  ans sometimes they aren't. His lectures are horrible  he is extremely boring and doesn't know how to teach. If you want to learn anything  don't take him.
4,Decent intoduction to Geography. Didn't have a problem with the class. He would sometimes get sidetracked during lectures. Lectures seemed to directly follow the text book. Took this class many years ago and don't remember much else.
5,Dr. King is intelligent and humorous  his anecdotes apply geography to the real world  instead of just teaching out of the textbook. If you come to class and study for the tests  you will be rewarded with respect and an excellent grade!
1,He is a horrible teacher and kinda creepy. We never once looked at a map  and it was a Geography class!!
4,Great teacher and always ready to help you if you can put in efforts
4,Debra is a good teacher She is going to help you if you are putting efforts never miss her any class because she always teach something interesting and important
3.5,She is a very nice teacher. most classmates likes her. she give the people good mark!!
4,She is really good. If you show your effort  she will pay for you.
4,Her tests are easy yet she is not an easy marker. I agree that she is picky. she is definitely gonna fail you if you miss her class for more than 10 times.
5,A greaaaaaaaaaaaat teacher  eventhough i failed in her course. but her class was really easy  i failed in this course because i missed alot of quizes and assignment. however  she is a good teacher. strongly recommend~~~
2.5,She's picky about students.Apparently she preferes girls than boys.I can not believe she inveited her favorite students to her home for dinner while she gives others sh*t.
5,she is nice. take her class
5,She is a very good teacher.She is very helpful beautiful and nice.She is easy going and she talks everything with her students and it makes every students interesting and enjoy her class.Yo sexy teacher man.Everyone should take her class.However she is not a easy marker.
5,I Love you Debra!
5,nice lady~she likes talk about stories~which made the class intersting and we can still learn something from her class
5,taking Debra's class is a kind of enjoyment~ her class is full of fun and relaxation~ study ll never be a burden if u take her class~ Debra is definitely a good english teacher
5,She is the best english teacher ! Her class is very interesting~!
5,She's great & cute! She's my favorite teacher as her class is quite fun and clear.
5,No Comments
5,she is very patient  never get mad or angry  gives back fair marks  very friendly
4.5,she is a really good teacher  has a nice personality. If you attend the class regularly  do your assignment  and be active  then you will get a high mark. I like her she is the best teacher in my perspective.
2,she is a nice teacher!
3,she is nice teacher. I like her treat people very equal.
3.5,she is a very good teacher

5,Currently taking this class. Englander is an excellent professor. The material is hard but if you pay attention its really not that bad. Tests are challenging but you can bring a page of notes and he is generous with points. I definitely recommend taking a class with Irv. He's worked with computers since they were invented and he knows his stuff.
1.5,Taught that class like you already knew what he was talking about  and I was silly enough to think that I take classes to learn the material in them. Tried several times to go to his office hours but he was never there. Sent him multiple emails but he never responded. Would strongly recommend never taking this professor.
4.5,To counter the prior comment  then I think if one shows up at lectures  reads the book  and actually takes time to understand the material  then one can do well. I ended up with a good grade. Prof. Englander is very knowledgeable and I recommend his course if you actually want to learn things. But  for a free ride  then this course is not the one.
3.5,YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. Impossible material  impossible assignments  impossible exams. I am a CIS major  and im telling anyone who is considering taking Irv...DONT DO IT! You will fail!
3.5,First  IT 101 is a joke so it really doesn't matter. Englander is a funny guy and you don't have to do much for his IT workshops. Just get an 80+ on the final and a guaranteed 4.0
3,Irv has worked at Bentley since the 70's  and it shows. Classes aren't so bad  but his exams are. Don't take this class unless you're a CIS major  and even then consider waiting until Irv retires. He states he'd rather be working at MIT and how dull [Bentley] students are these days.
4,Went to MIT and knows his stuff. He's a goofy little guy that you shouldn't take too seriously. A great and fun prof if you just get to know him. Definately go to office hours and he'll help you out  but you may get stuck watching youtube videos with him. Class is hard  but really just put a full day's worth of study in b4 the exam and youll b fine
4.5,My favorite professor so far. You HAVE to read. But you will learn more in this class than anything you have taken at Bentley. This is not a class that you take as a fluff course though  he expects you to work hard and his tests show that expectation.
2.5,No labs and no assignments  which makes learning linux challenging. Keeping good notes is imperative as he imparts all of his knowledge to you via lecture. This is an advanced class and you are on your own for developing hands-on practice strategies and methods. I did learn a lot though.
3,I've taken Irv for 240 and 420. Teaches you more than anyone needs to know. He laughs at his own jokes and is a little awkward. Learned a lot from both classes  and received a 3.7 in both.
2.5,Probably the worst CIS class I've taken. While the subject is great  Irv teaches it in a way that's only for those that already know Linux and are extreme geeks. I had a 3.5 CIS and overall GPA and somehow ended up with a C in this class. Irv also hardly teaches as all that you learn is from reading the book and doing your own thing in Linux.
4.5,Irv is a cool guy  if you are a CS major or are just into computers. Be prepared for difficult tests  but he grades on a curve. You will without a doubt learn a lot in this class.
3.5,Easy class if you know some stuff about computers.
4,Yeah his class is tough  but he grades on a curve a lot and you'll probably end up getting much higher grades than you expected. He knows what he teaches is hard. So he's willing to help you not to screw your grades up in the end. Read the book  although his book is hard to read too  and make sure to get good scores on assighments.
1.5,Extremely hard class. Class average's on the the three exams were 68  72  and 78. Grades assignments easily and scales final grades a good amount. You will need to read a lot  but in the end  you will learn so much.
3,monotone voice  hard three quizzes  two exams  one final but easy projects. weights assignments (ie quizzes 15%  final 20%). he's smart  hard and knows his stuff so if you want to learn take him but if you want it isn't don't.
1,These is without a doubt one of the worst classes i have. he tells us to read the book for the quizzes then never puts that info on the quizzes. Grades projects and what not easily  but its hard to get good test and quiz grades...good luck with this guy
1.5,Yeah  I actually talked to another IT101 teacher and found out he's teaching stuff that isn't necessarily needed for the course. He's awful. Says that if you study you'll do well but he words questions on quizzes to confuse you. It's hard to do well in this class. Take Whitcomb or someone else  because Englander is not helpful.
1,RUN FOR YOUR LIFE. DO NOT TAKE HIM! EVER!
2,this class is the worst IT class you can ever take. do not take this class unless you want to be a computer geek
4.5,I got a B!!! I got a B!!! For the first time in my life I understood Math. Prof. Quereshi is very helpful! Take him if you have a very difficult time with numbers. Just be sure to do homework and ask questions if you need help. :) YEY QUERESHI!!!
4,He's a really nice teacher. He gives a lot of examples during lecture  which helps your understanding a lot. Homework  quizzes  and exams are easy.
4.5,Prof. Quereshi is the best Math teacher I've ever had! I've struggled with algebra before  but with him  I found it really easy. AWESOME professor. Funny and also approachable. Just do your homework and keep your green sheet handy and you'll be fine! He's the best math professor I've ever had!
4,Quereshi is a funny teacher. take his class if you are looking to pass math 220. I hate math  but he made it not so bad.
4,Great teacher. He has an accent  but you can still understand him. Very funny aswell. EASY A+. Just do your classwork and homework and you're set.
3,Pretty easy teacher  if you want an easy A get him! But beware  his English is not good!
5,"I enjoyed this class because Mr. Qureshi is intelligent and using humor to teach intermediate algebra. He's known for saying  ""This is a beautiful equation"" and ""You are a good student""."
4.5,This professor is quite possibly the best I've taken so far. English is definitely his 2nd lang. but his teaching is better than all the other teachers i have taken so far. He grades extremely fair. And if your motivated  there is no reason why you won't get an A in his class. He is not confusing and easy to understand
5,great teacher... that s all abut him not a+ but he deserved a from me
1,This guy does not speak english and is very hard to understand. you have to spend more time trying to understand what he says then what he is actually teaching!!!
4.5,He was a great math teacher  and his enthusiasm for math really showed. I woils warn future students his accent makes him hard to understand. It took me about two weeks to be able to understand him.
5,Honestly  I am appalling at Math but this professor is great and makes the class really fun. He is really helpful and understanding and is prepared to take time to go through the problems and help you get the highest grade you can.
5,Mr. Qureshi is very clear and precise. He clearly enjoys math and really wants to help you understand and love it too. He's extremely funny and playful when it comes to numbers. Unless you don't come to class and don't care about getting a good grade  you should get an A.
3.5,Honestly I need sometime to understand what he said because he got pretty strong accent but it ain't a problem to listen later on. Most of the test are MC and even Final. The questions are straight forward. What u need to do is just keep up with his homework(even though he did not really check it...lol) then u would not have any problem in class:)
3.5,He's SUPER funny and that makes the class fun.He's very clear when he talks MATH  but sometimes it's hard to understand him when he's speaking plain English. I hate boring math teachers and he's not even close to being boring!
4.5,Great class...patient teacher...class is pretty easy and if your having trouble following the class he is more than willing to assist you  even during test/quizzes. You wont have any regrets taking his class and his accent is not a hindurance in your studies.
4.5,"Very ""Handsome"" class....A bit challenging in the summer.. but great teacher to have taken it with..."
4.5,I had a D in the same subject that i took in previous quarter. This proffessor might seem funny  but his way of teaching is extreemly good.He makes sure that u get what he is trying to teach u. Very good teacher!!
3.5,Mr. Quereshi is awesome!!! He was easy. I never understood what he was saying  but I'm also from an area in which people only speak English. He really tries to make you understand. He is pretty funny and has a great personality!! He never responds to emails  though. IF YOU CAN  TAKE HIM!!!!!
1,He doesn't understand English that well  he only has one hour a week office hours to help all of his students  he doesn't reply in e-mails and he does not grade fairly... DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE NOT STRONG IN MATH SKILLS!!!!
4,quite good proffesor
4,Dr. Eberlein is smart and can lead an interesting discussion.
3,Boring like hell the class was a waste of time too
5,He is Intelligent  Brilliant  & Clearly an academic. He really believes in what he is teaching and really cares about his students. He listens to suggestions  responds quickly to e-mail  provides good feedback and is just an overall nice guy. Hes def an introvert - give him a lecture or 2 before he opens up. He has a lot to offer - so go to class!
2,No Comments
5,Great Prof!.. too bad he's not at York permanently  every student should have a chance to take a course with him!
4.5,Overall a good prof. He tends to be monotonous and is somewhat hard on marking. However  he is very intelligent  his notes are very good and he is very helpful to students. Make sure to study his notes for exams.
4,Nice enough guy  extremely intelligent and good lecture notes  but his actual lectures are quite dry. He talks in a monotone voice and it is kind of easy to drift off.
2,he's too tough on marking and i thnkhe just marks papers at time so that they fall into some type of marking spectrum he wishes to achieve ... unpredictable marker .... i don't even think he knows what he thinks is 'A' type work ... other than marking and getting a disapointing grade he's an ok prof
5,he is a great teacher and he really knows his stuff. he is not boring at all  quite interesting actually! i really enjoy being in his class.
4,he knows his stuff  maybe a bit too demanding
3,BORING BORING BORING
2,Yes! Very boring...
2.5,BORING!
2,I regret taking her class... So many better professors at York  in my opinion. I really do think there are many more qualified professors at the institution than her to be chair/dean. Also found her class really boring. She's a decent person over all though.
5,good prof hard class
4,She asks more questions than she answers and she sometimes lectures on material that is irrelevant to the course. However  her lectures are still interesting and informative. Plus  her exams are ridiculously easy.
5,This professor rests at the top of my list  not because I finished her course with an A+  but it is because of the passion that drives her to do what she does. She uses power-point  and other forms of multi-media to materialize theoretical abstractions. She comes off intimidating at first but she is great once you get to know her. Her exams: GREAT!
4,Ananya is clearly passionate about her research and this shines through. She does ask a lot of questions but it's only to engage students. She provides you with a critical lense to think but sometimes her bias comes through but she doesn't deny that she is bias. Good prof.
3,I agree with the above comment that this class won't teach you anything new  it reiterates the same material from previous pols classes. The prof asks way too many questions but she makes her lectures concise and to the point.
1,Lecture moves like a slug. Teaching style is mundane. Lecture seems like a seminar. She is kind of rude. Snobbyish. Stays on the same point for long periods of time. She asks too much of the class (in terms of questions). You can tell what she's going to say before she says it.
1,wily  untrustworthy  thinks she knows a lot (but doesn't) 
5,Great Proff!! clear  helpful and methodical. But tooo many readings per class...other than that  she does a great job!! i would give her an A overall!
1,No Comments
5,Unless you desperatly need an easy A  I do not recommend this course...Unfortunatly there is no category listed here I can criticize her on. The course is ridiculously easy and BORING! It won't teach you ANYTHING that you should not already know: neoliberal this  bad for democracy that  WTO this  IMF/World Bank that
1,worst prof at york
5,Wicked instructor  y the hell did she have to leave us midway through the year though? It cost me my A!! Her tests are hilariously easy. Trust me  whatever you think of them  just hold it in and WRITE THEM AND BE HAPPY. It could be worst  TRUST ME. I appreciated her way more after she left.
5,Great Professor! Always engaging the class in discussion  provides lots of extra resources online. Very approachable and fair. The material in this class wasn't as interesting as her approach to it--she really tried to help us see differing perspectives on different issues.
5,Extremely lively and makes class interesting!

5,"Mason was soo funny. i love his sense of humor. and he had a great dog when i visted him in his office hours. and outside the building he had hours in it said  ""no dogs allowed"" it was fantastic."
2,HE'S NOT VERY INTERESTING. vERY MUCH A NERD  WHO REALLY RUINED A FUN CLASS AND MADE ME LOSE INTEREST. hE LIKES TO RAMBLE ABOUT NONSENSE AND HIS tA'S ARE HALF RETARDED  ALTHOUGH HOT. i WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS GUY. nOT QUALIFIED!!
2,Ruined a fun class. Very boring  which is opposite to Geo. Catastrophes. Lectures are organized and on PowerPoint  however.
3.5,The prof is ok. The material is easy  but not the 2 tests. Huge amount of easy calculation in short time and you need show them in details are not easy even the tests are very straight forward. The marker is a litter bit tough. You must attend to tutorial if you want good mark  the TA give your hint of exam.
1,Boring professor that creates hard midterm.
5,Dedicate at least a day to doing problems per chapter. The exams aren't too difficult  but they are tricky so you need to know your stuff. He's a good prof  practice the problems he posts at the end of lectures and you'll pass. Go to tutorials for extra practice questions and you'll get at least a B. I stress  go to tutorials if you can.
3.5,Good prof. Read the text and do practice questions and you will be fine.
5,Dean for test paper  everything u confused he can explain clearly. He is a humourous guy and always sign for attendants for some special time(Don't miss the class at the mid-time). Course is not that hard  focus on details and tricks on the calculation he prepared.
1,be ready to teach yourself. doesn't prepare you.
5,The way of his teaching makes stats easier and simpler.
4.5,Excellent professor. Tells u exactly what will come up on the mid-term and final. Assignments are straight forward. The course is not that hard and he makes it even easier. Getting an A is not so hard provided you do weekly practice of the questions. Good luck
5,Simply amazing. If you do poorly in his course  you have nobody to blame but yourself. He teaches the material very well  sticking to the textbook  with full answers online. Also  the exam questions were often variations of ones we had already seen/worked through together in class.
4,Take this course after taking adms 3330. It is very easy because 75% of the material is covered in adms 3330. The prof is good as long as u do your work  which means do not leave anything till the last second. Assignment is worth 20% and difficult. Final  mid term are alright i.e. not very difficult. Attend all lectures.Overall a good experience.
5,Great professor  take his course without any consideration. Do something at home and you ll be fine.
2.5,Hard marker and expects way too much.
4.5,he is a good prof. with a great sense of humour. he covers topics well and gives detailed explanations with a lot of examples. best thing is to read his slides and the textbook (for problems) when it comes to exams and quizzes.
5,Outstanding prof. I hate to repeat what everyone else is saying but I have to say he really does have a great teaching style and he sincerely cares about his students.
5,One of the best teachers I've ever had. Has a wonderful teaching style that makes going to class very worthwhile. He truly cares about the performance of his students. He's also a very funny guy.
4.5,I see some of the older ratings say he's too quick and there's too many notes. I took Operations Mngmt with him and I dont remember writing down more than 5 lines in any given class. He has office hours two times a weeks which is great and he knows the field inside out which is great if you're interested in it further.. Only good things to say..
5,Mr Karakul really knows how to teach. He does not care about the stuff that the students do not need. Fair in grading  everything was prescheduled  quizzes   assignments  exams  examviewings... I really enjoyed this course. Just study before the exams  that's enough. Overall : very good !
5,awesome guy!!! had a great time in his class  learned alot and he is extremely efficient in getting papers marked and returned. hes really helpful if your stuck and is extremely approachable!!! Would definately take another class with him!!!
5,this prof is really smart and he is a really good marker  and he is super helpful
5,He is a great professor. Pleasure to be in his class.
1,tough gradrer
1,"Would not recommend anyone to take his online course. According to Hassan  ""As far as I know  this course has never Audio or Vedio lectures because they are not developed by the departmentschool. So  we have to read the text book and then post any questions on any concept or methods here and I will address it."" TA worked pretty hard."
1,BIG ACCENT
4,I kinda like this professor. I can feel that he is trying so hard to make the students understand everything. The bad thing is  hes kinda short tempered. But he did it because he cares for his students. I'd take another courses with him in the future.
5,What a guy! So helpful and nice  if you go to his office hours and show that you care  he'll try his best to help you out! Thank you Hassan for the great semester!
4,Anyone who says the prof is not helpful  probably they didn't ask for help! Prof. Hassan is very helpful and caring. He omitted one of the required assignments so we can increase our marks.Midterm wasn't a killer  it required someone who study. Overall  I'd take another class with him.
1,Took his online course. Worst experience so far in university (3rd year). Offers no help  and doesnt provide proper info on anything. First assignment was the most vague piece of $#!$ everyone I showed as ever seen. Shame on York for hiring him to educate the new was of statisticians and business people.
1,In my last year at York and have made it this far without submitting a Professor rating. Does not answer emails. Does not offer help. Unclear  arrogant  condescending. Switch sections  or good luck.
1,Never responded to emails and never explained himself. Was never available or helpful.
2,Do not take internet section with him. The course is easy especially if u have studied adms 3330. He does not gives any feedback about the assignments and mid terms. When I e-mailed him for his office hours twice  he never responded. Take this course in fall or winter i.e. a lecture. Avoid the internet section. Overall a bad experience for me.
2.5,I have taken stats before at another uni and had to take it again at York. I decided to take the online course. Hassan and the TA never respond to questions and when I wanted to discuss my assignment mark (62%) he could barely explain to me what I did wrong. I really did not like him as a teacher. Maybe it was just the online aspect.
1,Big Accent....
4,dudeeeeeeeeeeee u rock... no surprises in the exam... just practice back of the book question.. extremely helpfulll
3.5,oh hassan hassan hassan. he is an interesting prof. he does care for his students and is very enthusiastic about the material covered in class. he is quite lenient in his marking and his quizzes are not hard. only problem is you have to participate in his class  but i actually learnt a lot as a result. overall good prof.
1.5,I one of the worst profs I ever encountered. Whether you study hard or not (unfortunately  I've chose the prior option)  quizes are incomprehensible  discussions are irrelevant and half of the articles are complete nonsense that aren't worth reading. p.s. Avoid challenging his opinion  he won't like you.
4,He really is a good prof. Wants to see his students succeed (unlike a lot of other profs at York). Highly recommend him. He's very flexible and very reasonable. As long as you do the questions assigned you'll do great. Theres no surprises. Two thumbs up!!
2.5,He can't speak good english. Unfair maker! You may not get the grade that you worked hard! Lazy professor!
5,One of the best professors at Atkinson. This guy really cares about his students  is always nice and polite  is helpful and fair with marks if you can make a good case. I'm not sure who wrote the part about his English  but they got it all wrong  his English is very good. He is one of the few good prof's in Atkinson Business courses.
3,Although he can't really speak good English but actually  all I can say is to study hard by yourself! But he is always a good prof. to seek for help! He will provide you as much as possible! Don't be afraid to seek help from him!

5,Lectures were very clear and classes were interesting. Prof was very helpful in and out of class.
2,Relies completely on exam grades  which can make the class really difficult. Get the textbook and look over anything he may have skimmed because it seems everything is fair game for his exams. He teaches on very specific topics for such a broad course that's supposed to cover all of plant evolution.
1,Beware of Dr Fernando as a professor or advisor. He does not teach to broad learning styles in students. It can be a serious problem for someone who needs to understand plant science taught by him. He relies on textbooks. When answering questions  he was more intolerant and unhelpful than any other teacher I have ever had.
2.5,I like his lectures and labs. Its the exams which I find completely absurd. What is emphasized in class is not what is tested on  rather there is a very heavy focus on material specifically NOT emphasized. Unless you are capable of memorizing every little thing he says  you are stuck with a passing but mediocre grade on the exams.
5,Amazing professor
4.5,Wonderful professor
5,He is an AWAESOME teacher and I loved the class especially since I love plants to much  he is dedicated and very knowledgeable
4,Really cool guy  really hard class
4.5,Didn't care for most of the content of the lecture  bit too much genetics. The lab was very useful and vital to today's increasing use of bio-tech.
3.5,The nicest guy in the world  not the most consice teacher. he curves the class big time.
4,yes  a little unclear  but is always willing to help
1.5,ouch.

3.5,Lots of material bu interesting. Learned alot.
1,Absolutely AWFUL prof! Was a grad student at the time and loaded coursework down on us like crazy! Very unclear and very tough grader! Spent my whole summer reading very difficult books. :(
1,Terrible professor. Learning Latin would be clearer than listening to this woman's lectures. She is all over the place and does not explain anything well. She gives paragraphs of instructions for an answer she expects to be a few sentences. Welcome to Hell
1,Horrible teacher  her instructions are super long but aren't clear at all. One of the worst teachers I have ever had. Would rather just have a final test instead of written work during the semester.
2,I took another Con Law class in undergrad that covered the exact same stuff  but McCluskey really butchered the topics. She was pretty much incomprehensible  so I relied on my undergrad notes for this class. She means well and is nice  but doesn't really deliver.
2,She is very knowledgable and tries to communicate  but something gets lost
1.5,Unable to follow a thought or keep a question in mind while answering. Uses 'panels ' completely ineffective b/c she asks nonsensical questions ('what is a winning con. arg circa 1800?'). Most reading is not useful  and reiterates the same point over and OVER. She doesn't listen to student responses in class + tries to pick fights. RUN!!!
4,I know I'm in the minority  but I liked her. She's is very knowledgeable and friendly. In the beginning  I didn't care for her  but she grew on me. In the end  I realized I learned a lot. She tells you exactly what to expect on exams. Very willing to meet with students.

1,I concur with everyone else's comments.
1,McCluskey is the worst law professor ever. Avoid her at all costs. She can't complete a thought or give a straightforward rule. She never answers questions clearly. She took an interesting subject and ruined it. She makes you stand up when you speak in class  and nothing anyone says is ever good enough. I've never hated a class so much in my life.
1.5,Either very smart or a very good actor  but lacks the ability to answer questions or present the issues to allow first-year law students to comprehend. Way too much irrelevant reading!! Perhaps she would be better for upper-level students. To answer her questions it is necessary to read her mind. Run!!
1,The worst professor at UB Law. A hard grader  but fails to have any knowledge of the subject. Highly irritating.
1,AWFUL TEACHER!!! NEVER TAKE A CLASS WITH HER. A COMPLETE DITZ!
1,Horrible. I wonder if she even went to law school
3.5,Not great  but incredibly easy.
1,Arghhh! What a nightmare!
5,Fantastic professor. Had him for several classes. If there were more profs like Jon  I'd have a PhD!
4,Exam is difficult  but assignments are fun.
4.5,This professor loves teaching and really wants you to apply the information. The class is basically how to use the design principles to better your life and career - very motivational and directly useful for any major. And the class is an easy 4.0 as long as you pay attention to the details.
4,This class is really easy as long as you follow the book and practice the exam before you take it. Before you buy the book make sure your getting the current one and the right class book. I accidentally bought the book for IDES 250!
3,He's a good teacher and is always willing to help you out. If you had a problem with something  just ask him. DON'T RELY ON YOUR TA'S...mine sucked. He is very unorganized  but if you follow the book you will be ok.
3.5,Overall this class is easy. Just need to practice for exams or you will not do well.

2.5,Exams are extremely easy  but be careful  the assignments can screw you over if you don't follow in instructions exactly. He is not helpful at all if you have questions  so use allmsu and ask other students.
5,EXTREMELY early class  but worth it! Very friendly  tests are extremely easy  but you need to GO TO CLASS!
1.5,Nice man but makes Math extremely confusing. Over half of my class dropped. I got an A but it was from studying the book myself and being decent at math already.
4.5,Thought he was great  will take his class anytime. Very helpful if you know why you are in the class. I was unsure of him at first but if you show commitment  he works with you. Takes time to answer your qusetions if don't understand. Also gives extra credit. Got an A.
3,Yes  he erases problems fast  but he really has a heart. If you're failing  he will try to accommodate you. If you're in there the first week and can't keep up with him  don't drop the class because he gets better.
1,There is a reason I'm in the dumb math after being out of highschool now for 5 yrs. Flies thru review like you know it already. Erases problems before you can copy and work them. Doesn't work problem  just asks for answer. Emailed class to tell them there would be a quiz THE DAY BEFORE IT WAS TO HAPPEN. Looks lost & confused. Dropped class A.S.A.P.
1,He gets confused doing his own problems he is virtually inaccessable and he is like late to his own classes
3.5,He was not that difficult of a professor. His tests were straight forward and offered extra credit.
1.5,No Comments
2.5,"Lets you use ""fact sheets"" for every quiz or exam including finals! helps a lot!"
2,Moves very fast and is hard to follow. He erases problems to make room before you can copy them down. He cuts class close and skips stuff to finish. I had to drop the class because I failed too many quizes - after getting a B in 012 the semester before. He seems like a nice guy outside of class.
1.5,Erases example problems before you get a chance to write them down  If you ask how to do a problem he looks at the clock  claims he won't have enough time to completely work the problem and just tells you the answer. He constantly messes up problems which left you more confused than you were before
1,WORST TEACHER EVER!!! he doenst want to help anyone and he gets mad when you ask him to explain a problem. he doesnt know what he is doing and messes up on example problems! drop him now!
1,No Comments
2,Messes up example problems making it more confusing to and already confused mind.
1.5,Very hard to understand  He also messes up example problems so there is no answer and really confuses you. If you get him  drop him.
5,Bob is awesome  end of story. Take him and don't look back. Makes a tough subject easy. Lectures reflect the test directly.
5,Dr. Robert Bender is the best professor at UTD. He opens many ways to earn extra bonuses credits. There are 2 exams . 1 lowest grade drop. He gives a very good exams review with questions answers keys 4 days b4 the exam day so you can study it. At the end  no one left behind B. Thank you Dr. Robert Bender.
5,IGNORE the last 9 reviews they're BS. Bob doesn't do EC and no paper. There are 2 exams he writes (60%)  online hmwk (10%) and 1 department-wide final (30%) he doesn't write. Bob is great and his exams aren't easy but he gives you great reviews. The Final SUCKS! Bob never sees it so he can only help so much. DO WELL on Bob's exams you'll need it.
5,The coolest and funniest teacher out there. Don't question this  just take any of this classes. You won't want to miss them. And this professor is pretty adorable. 2 EXAMS . 1 LOWEST GRADE DROP. UNDERSTANDS THE NEED OF STUDENTS. EXTRA BONUSES CREDITS  YALL @UTD
5,This PROF.'s amazing. I've had PROF for 2 classes now and they're wonderful  clear-cut  and pretty easy if you put in the work. There are 2 exams  and 1 paper. If you get a grade that you're happy with on the first 2 exams  you don't have to take the final and it will replace your lowest test grade. OPEN MANY WAYS TO EARN EXTRA CREDITS. Awesome pro
5,Look at THIS TEACHER scores. They aren't lying. Easiest  most entertaining  and the most informative class I've ever taken. TEACHER will make you love and appreciate . I work and I'm often either late or absent for THIS class   but TEACHER won't punish you for that. Exams are a breeze  nothing tricky. Show up to class  take notes  and enjoy the sho
5,Great teacher! The Professor hands you an A  but it's up to you to go and get it. You have to attend for the quizzes which are basically completion grades  and the two major tests are all open book online. If you care about your grade  you'll get your A. I also learned a bit as well. Opens many ways to earn extra bonuses credits. 1 LOWEST GRADE DRO
5,This prof. is one of the best teachers I've ever had! The amount of material on each test can be easy (MUTIPLE CHOICES)  but if you study the exam review a week or so ahead  you'll be okay. The tests can be easy  so you study hard independently to be successful in this class. An A in this class is easy  but it is attainable. HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR AL
5,Very likable professor . seems to really enjoy teaching students. The reviews for the test are extensive and descriptive.
5,NO BOOK REQUIRED. Prof. is more than willing to meet with you if you should need help. The lectures are amazing and Prof. is a very passionate speaker. Open many ways to earn extra credits
5,Prof's amazing. I've had this prof. for 2 classes now and they're wonderful  clear-cut  and pretty easy if you put in the work. There's 2 exams  1 final  and 1 paper. If you get a grade that you're happy with on the first 2 exams  you don't have to take the final OR take the final and it will replace your lowest test grade. Awesome Prof.
5,THERE ARE 2 TWO EXAMS . ONE LOWEST GRADE DROP. THE PROFESSOR OPENS MANY WAYS TO EARN EXTRA BONUSES CREDITS.
5,R Bender is the best financial professor in UTD period. Take him if you want to learn something and pass. Funny guy and encourages questions. I am not a finance guy and the class is challenging but his method of teaching helps a whole lot and helped me. Take him.....if you want to live....through a finance class.
5,Best teacher in the school of management  knows a lot  teaches a lot  jokes a lot  cares a lot.
5,I really liked Bob's class (he doesn't like to be called professor). He was really helpful and made things easy to understand. Most test questions are graded right or wrong  but the questions are very similar to the homework and the practice problems in class. Does things 'old school ' using papers for notes using overhead camera.
5,Bob is a great professor  he is old school and uses an overhead so you pretty much have to go to class because he does not utilize e-learning except to post the syllabus. If you go to class and pay attention  he gives you every opportunity to make an A. He thoroughly explains everything and does several practice problems in class. Take him!
4.5,His exam questions ALL came from the example problems in class  you knew what to expect on the exam. Easy A if you attend class and rework the examples. His passion for finance and his jokes every now and then made the class enjoyable considering it's finance.
2.5,I don't doubt for a minute most of those posts about his great sense of humor and how a good professor he is  were posted by the same Bender. He uses the projector to show old sheets he probably has been using for the last 20 years. SOM should pride to have a real good professor for this Core class. His jokes were probably funny 20 years ago.
5,BEST finance professor ever!! He knows his work and teaches it with a passion. He's funny and really cares about his students. He sometimes brings donuts to class!! Highly recommend him!
5,Great teacher - highly recommended. I didn't always go to class  but you can really get behind if you don't. Doing the homework really helps to get in gear for the tests. The tests aren't bad - except the final - which he has no control over and which I felt completely unprepared for. HOWEVER he gives a mighty curve for it.
4,One of my hardest classes yet. She grades tough  but is pretty fair. Make sure you go to class for the in class problems  as well as doing the take home problems. She knows a lot about her field. She ended up curving our overall grade even though she does not curve tests.
5,This by far one of the most knowledgeable professors WMU has. Her class was tough and she makes you work for it but if you go to class and actually study the in class notes you wrote (that is exactly what is on the exam BTW)  you will pass and more importantly LEARN. Probably wont get an A though. DO NO BUY THE BOOK DO NOT BUY THE BOOK!
5,She is one of the best professors I've had at WMU. She really knows her lectures and is extremely knowledgeable of her subject. She is helpful and very respectful. Her tests are difficult so you will need to study a lot. You can buy the book for practice problems  but not mandatory. I got an A and never bought the book.
5,She is super awesome!!!!!
5,Awesome teacher! The class is hard and there is a lot of material but if you go to class and take notes you will be fine! She knows EVERYTHING!
5,She is an awesome prof. Her notes are so easy to follow(don't miss a class or you will miss a lot of material) and she does a good job of explaining the in-class handouts. Tests are all short answer so make sure you know your stuff because most of the points lost will be because of the lack of explanation. Highly recommend
5,Greatest teacher ever. So clear. So precise. I wish she could teach every class I'll ever have to take. There is no greatest prof.  not only on campus  but in the whole country I am sure. :-)
5,One of the most knowledgeable professors I have ever had. Tests are very difficult  but you can study for them. Write down EVERYTHING she says because you will see it again. Don't miss a class because you will miss a lot of material. If you work hard you will do well.
5,Dr. Sinning is wonderful. She sent me pages-long emails with explanations whenever I contacted her with questions and is available outside of office hours if you need it. No doubt this is a tough class  but if you work hard and ask for help  you will be fine. Don't miss class or you miss out on A LOT.
2.5,Hard class.. Impossible to remember everything. SO BORING. You have to study A TON to get an A.
5,Don't buy the book. Awesome teacher.
5,You would be hard pressed to find anything negative about Dr. Sinning. You will learn more in this class than in any other class. She has been teaching at WMU for over 30 years  and instead of being lazy and reaping the benefits  she has only kept improving on the quality of teaching. Amazing professor. WMU is lucky to have her! Grading VERY FAIR.
5,Dr. Sinning may be the best accounting professor at WMU. She helps you learn more than you could ever think of. If you are going into tax for a career  you will be very happy you had her. At the end of the semester  you will have a solid understanding of basic tax. She does demand that you work hard though! Grading is very fair. GO TO CLASS!
5,Dr. Sinning rocks my world! She has the patience of a nun  this woman is a SAINT. A total blessing to WMU  students are lucky to have her teaching. God bless this woman. The BEST professor I have EVER had. My only gripe is that she doesn't give enough room on the exams to work out problems  you have to write really small. Oh well. Dr. Sinning ROCKS
5,BEST TEACHER. You do not need the book (if there even is one) She gives you handouts does great examples. Study ALL of your notes and you will do find. Tests are short answer/problems. She def. Knows her stuff. Even If you failed her class you would want to take her again. She is great!!!!
5,VALUE ADDED. Western is lucky to have her. Dr. Sinning is easily one of the best professors I have ever had  hand down. She makes the subject CRYSTAL clear  and is EXTREMELY helpful if you have any problems (almost clairvoyant). And talk about professional! Even if you aren't studying accounting  you should take her tax class. Thank you Dr Sinning!
5,I love this class. She grades very difficult and requires you to give explanations on EVERYTHING for the tests. She explains everything very well though and will answer any question you have about tax crystal clear.
5,Dr. Sinning is wonderful. 1) she cares 2) read the notes & you're golden 3) MUST attend class to take notes 4) DO NOT buy the textbook.
4,"Prof. Sinning is awesome. She makes tax accounting much more understandable than reading the book. My advice - do not buy the book and go to class all of the time. WARNING!!! She will throw information into tests that you have never seen before to ""trip you up "" so be careful. Make sure that you know her notes (ALL OF THEM) or you will fail."
5,One of the best instructors at Western. Very professional.
2,Hard grader but overall funny  interesting  and knowledgeable teacher.
2,not fun. not recommended. at all. you can take the same class  learn just as much  and not have a nightmare semester thanks to dinero. not helpful. not understanding. gives no slack. class is interesting  but he is a ****.
3.5,Ok  the tests are very difficult  in-class essay format  but overall a good class to take. I learned alot about the middle east  but Dinero def knows his stuff  so you have to do the reading. He's very sarcastic  but his rants about the president are pretty funny. He'll keep you awake in an 8am that's for sure.
1,He is seriously the worst man alive. Not helpful  very rude and arrogant  and does not link topics to class
1,he is the worst teacher I have ever had in my entire life...no joke! All he does is criticize rather then teach...take my advice and don't pick his class
1,Ridiculously sarcastic when giving you feedback. Has taken 3 shots of pure caffeine in the morning to be jumpy during class as he explains and jumps around from topic to topic with no clear relation.Thinks he is the smartest man in the world. Biggestego

5,Loved Dr. Waterhouse she's so understanding and sweet. She really wants us to do our best. She made class interesting and always let us leave early as long as we finished the assignments given
3.5,I took Studies in Writing as a required course for English Ed  but this is a creative writing course. Wrote 3 creative papers  which I had never done before. She grades easily and pities you if you aren't a creative writing major. Does not do much during class time besides talk about the books but there are no testsquizzes. Sweet lady.
5,This is a fun class. You have to work for an A and much to my group mate's disappointment  you have to do work no matter which part of the magazine you work on. But  you get something awesome to put on your resume.
4.5,She is very nice and caring. She'll help you when you need it! So far this class has been easy yet full of information. I would take her again if I could!
5,She is the BEST :)
5,Where do I begin? Dr. Waterhouse has to be THE BEST professor I've had at CalU  thus far! She's extremely kind and caring  not mention helpful. I had her for Wednesday night class and she actually made me WANT to go to class. I definitely recommend her to everyone. :)
4.5,I highly recommend taking your ENG 101 with her. She's extremely nice and understanding. The class isn't hard at all as long as you follow her instructions. She's always there to help if you are confused. Only downsides are that she does not post grades on D2L and rarely checks her e-mail.
4,Fun and nice lady. Helpful and understanding. Papers were easy  mostly opinion and personal stuff or interviews so it didn't require time consuming research. Class did kind of drag on sometimes  but it was an 3hr night class  so that happens. I would recommend!
4,Dr. Waterhouse is a really nice lady who is willing to help you if you need it. Every English class can be sloe but she tries her best to keep your interest. She is not too hard of a grader and I would definitely recommend her for an English class!
4.5,Very nice teacher. She grades the papers fairly easily and she is pretty helpful as well. Only complaint is that sometimes class just seems to drag on... very boring sometimes. But overall i would recommend.
4.5,Waterhouse was great. She is very nice and very helpful. Granted it is english so it obviously is going to be a little slow at times but she tried her hardest to keep students active and interested. Only had to write 4 papers and take a few tiny quizzes. She did ramble on a LOT about nothing at times. I would absolutely take her again if i could!
4.5,Had her for a night class. never went the whole time. did a lot of creative writing kind of papers. only 4 papers and have time to work on them in class. i would take her again. very help ful
4,very nice. extremely easy grader on papers. sometimes makes you work on something all class and then doesn't do anything with it afterward.
4.5,She is a great teacher. She is also a veru nice person and very friendly. I learned a lot from her.
4,She was a very very nice person and extremely helpful. Class was never the full time period and she gave a good amount of time for all assignments. Four papers and class work is graded. It is important to go to class. I would take her again!
4,Waterhouse is a very nice person. And  to be honest you don't do much work in her class. You don't have to read the plays...take notes in class and you will be fine. 2 finals and a paper is all your grade consists of. But if you work hard you will get a good grade.
4.5,Very helpful and good teacher. Workload was easy and grading was fair. I would take her again.
5,Dr. Waterhouse was my advisor  and a prof. She is the most influential prof I had at Cal U and she helped me tremendously with my writing.
5,Retook Comp II after getting an F with another prof and got an A with Waterhouse. Her paper assignments were fun and were allowed to pick topics within chosen career field.
5,great intro class. I had a laid back night class with her. Just real pleasant. Nothing crazy. No hitler teaching you. Just a laid back woman who likes to see you be creative. Wasn
5,Outstanding prof. The very best.
2,Incorrectly posted a grade and didn't inform me until further communication was made. This is not a good class to take during the summer  the presence of a prof is needed for success.
5,I don't know why people are so bitter towards this prof  she's actually great. Gave out 3% in free bonus marks to basically everyone. The midterm on the syllabus said chapters 1-7  she made it easier by only covering chapters 2 3 4  and 7. I studied total 12 hrs for midterm and got an A. Content on tests were directly from textbook and lectures.
1,Worst prof ! Avoid her at all costs !!
1,Would not recommend. Her modules are completely different from textbook material  and very long to get through. Study the whole textbook yourself. Exam was not fair at all and she didn't even write it. She told us the format right before we took it and you have to pass the exam to pass the course. horrible  avoid at all costs!!!
1,This is honestly the worst prof I've taken in university by far. The world's laziest and irresponsible prof award goes to her. Minutes before the final exam she told the class things that were never on the online modules OR the textbook. The modules and textbook were NOT consistent at all. Trust I can go on. AVOID THIS PROF FOR YOUR GPA'S SAKE!!!!
1,Horrible Prof. Probably the laziest person to teach Personal Finance. Final was tough  doesn't provide proper feedback to questions  and worst of all  leaves it all on you. Do not take this class ever.
5,Useful online course that explains some of the basics of personal financial planning. Joan was fair and clearly defined all expectations for this course. Quizzes  Mid-Term  and Final Examination were not overly difficult. Read the text  do the chapter problems  and review all of the modules before a test and you will be fine.
1,This prof is completely useless. I took this course online for only 4 weeks and had to drop it after the first quiz. Her modules made so much sense  however the questions on the quiz were worded so confusingly  it was like she wanted everyone to fail. Horrible prof  made an interesting  useful course into something hideous and disgusting. AVOID!
1,Not helpful. Not consistent with what she said would be covered on midterm/exam. Telling stories not teaching. It is supposed to an awesome course with real life information needed and practice - The prof is away from it.
1.5,lazy prof  not helpful to tend to students' questions. Not consistent with what she said would be covered on midterm/exam.
4,Online version. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to take after you finished FIN300 (many similar mathematical concepts). The tests are simple if you do your readings (all open book). The exam was ridiculously easier than I thought. Just do the easy practice questions in the textbook and online modules. When I met her in person  she was extremely friendly.
1,Hard marker.
1.5,Useless. Avoid at all cost. Had a great deal of interest in Finance before this class but she killed it with her unorganized lectures  hard marking and questions on exams outside the study material. Never again mate. Never.
4.5,I only took the 6 week online course so there isn't much interaction but modules pinpoint the main concepts. She's quite responsive and course is very easy with her. Open-book MC midterms and quizzes are fair as long as you read the book and do the problems & module exercises. Very fair final (problems and MC) w/cribsheet. Gives out bonus marks.
5,good prof  explains very well and uses examples from the real world. tests are very fair and I did learn alot from the class. very good course to take in spring/summer. Also she provides bonus marks  and it is a good courswe to take to learn some finanacial stuff and for easy good grade
5,Very nice  helpful and understanding teacher. Midterm was hard  but final and the overall course was easy. Highly Recommended!
1,Basically this teacher is useless. Her midterm/exam included things we never learned and she makes the questions as confusing as possible. When I try to get ask questions  she can never explain it clearly. The class average was 60%  so don't believe what was written below. AVOID! (from a high GPA student)
1,Stay away from her. Neither does she knew the theory nor does she teach well. I do not recommend her class at all.
4,Pretty good prof  midterms are based on the homework&textbook  she doesn't make you do more than that  it's easy to tell what she'll test you on...gives a lot of practical advise but rushes through the class sometimes - she won't kill your GPA I would suggest taking her  don't skip class
3,Lectures are boring  but what else can you expect from introductory econ? Read the textbook  do the weekly online quizzes  and try the optional homework assignments because some of the same questions will show up on tests. Do that and you'll be fine  whether you go to lecture or not. 3 exams  all multiple choice  and no cumulative final.
1,Although he's a nice guy  Prof G is the worst professor I've had at Pitt. He teaches straight from the book  and you don't learn any application (which is basically what the tests are). Went to his office hours many times and didn't find it to be helpful at all. He knows what he's talking about  but he sucks at teaching.
4.5,Good professor for this introductory class. The lectures reinforce exactly what's in the book so attendance isn't really mandatory  but he ends early almost every day. Work through the chapters to answer the weekly true false quizzes and you'll be fine.
5,I strongly recommend Dr. Giarratani
5,Dr. Giarratani is a department head and an internationally respected economist. He might not be the most riveting public speaker  but he sure does have a lot of insightful things to say. He is a fair grader and has reasonable expectations. Do the recommended book problems and go to him for help if you need to--test questions are often identical.
4.5,Professor Giarratani was an excellent teacher. He really knows a lot about Econ and has a lot of real world experience which he brings into the classroom (he worked with the White House on industrial policy negotiations with the Chinese). He has a great ability to get students to understand concepts and makes the material very clear
4.5,Giarratani is awesome. He has a boring voice  that is true. But  he is very passionate about econ and you can really tell. He throws in little jokes and stories to help make up for the tone of his voice. He explains things really well. I would definitely recommend him if you are deciding whether to take honors micro. He changes your perspective.
4.5,It's not terribly compelling material to teach  but Prof. Giarratani augments it with topics relevant to his students' lives. Exams and quizzes are very fair  and recommended practice materials seem abundant. Try to pay attention to lectures  though  because he may test some details directly from them.
4.5,Prof. G was a good teacher. The lectures were mostly a review of the readings  but goes in a bit more detail. Tests are fair  and fairly easy if you understand the concepts he is trying to teach.
1,Extremely difficult exams. They have nothing to do with the lectures and the wording is incredibly tricky. I would recommend taking this course with another professor.
3,Prof Giarratani's lectures were directly out of the book. They were a good review of the readings  but they tended to get very boring and monotonous. He had interesting stories but the majority of the lectures were him reviewing book material. His tests are worded in an extremely tricky manner as well.
4.5,Professor Giarratani is one of the best professors I've had at PITT. He has a genuine love of economics and it shows in his teaching. All his examples are crystal clear and are applicable to the real world. I guarentee even if you are not interested in economics you'll still leave the class feeling more informed and prepared for life after college.
2,Thought I wanted to be an econ major until I took this class. Some people did well if they made it their entire life  but I thought Frank was irrelevant and boring. His wording is nothing like the book so it was easy to get confused. He's not a great teacher but if you really need the course it's easy to get a C so take it Pass/Fail (S/NC at Pitt)
5,Such a great professor. Sweet and funny guy. Loves economics and traveling. His voice is sort of boring but he keeps his lectures relevant. Tests are mostly multiple choice and he's very realistic. Big on learning the material instead of testing like crazy. Loved the class (honors section).
4,Prof. G keeps things straightforward  which works well for the class. He is very passionate about the subject  and his applications to daily life are interesting. If you read and study for the tests (they aren't difficult) it's no problem to get an A.
4,Fair class  fair teacher...attendance is not mandatory as long as you follow the book...he is extra boring because of his monotone voice but is still a nice guy
4.5,Good professor. Putting aside his monotone inflection  he was an excellent teacher  and I enjoyed the course.
5,good professor for honors micro  the tests are pretty easy if you study and keep up with the reading. Willing to help with anything you have question on. Not recommended if you fall asleep easily  his voice is a bit monotone.
5,Very amusing and funny prof. Exams are easy if you read all chapters before exam and attend all lectures. exam format: 40 MC (2 pts ea) and 2 Applied free resonse problems broken into parts (10 pts ea). Final format: 1st part: 3rd non-cumulative exam (same as above). 2nd part cumulative: 40 MC drawn from practice online quizzes (identical! easy.)
5,Frank is a good guy  and as long as you follow along in the readings  you will do fine. Tests are concept-based  without many definitions. 2 midterms  2 quizzes  one final and maybe a small opportunity for extra credit in class. No mandatory HW.

5,Passionate teacher. I learned volumes of pertinent information from her. The class is actually fun! I was sorry to see the semester end!
5,What can you say about Dar...she's awesome! I've learned so much by taking her classes  as an undergrad and a graduate student. The things I have learned from her  I try to implement in my own classroom on a daily basis  and always think of her! Thanks Dar!
5,Most influential and inspiring teacher I've ever had. Practices what she preaches. She'll challenge your thinking and your image of great teaching. I am indebted to her...her class is worth so much more than I've paid for it.
5,i have never learned more in a class than i did in hers i lover having her so much make classs so much and the relationship between dar and herb is so sweet and special  they are the two best teachers ever...
5,Dar is an amazing teacher.she wants you to learn  but you have to show the initiative. If you go to class and participate you will learn more than you ever expected. she is always willing to help. her passion for quality education inspired me so much
5,i never had a teacher like her. she is the best.
4,Makes class fun and interesting. Has good and varied viewpoints on many teaching theories.
5,I just love her! What a great professor!
5,MRS. Schoenly has to be one of the best teachers ever! She is so helpfuland actually CARES about all of her students.
5,Dr. S is awesome.
4.5,EXTREMLY DEDICATED AND HAS GREAT KNOWLEDGE  DEMONSTRATES GOOD TEACHING IN HER CLASS
4.5,"Any class with Mrs. Schoenly is valuable as long as you dig into things with her and believe in her. Those who choose to ""just show up"" will never get anything out of her classes. End of the semester projects are extremely valuable!"
5,Excellent  Innovative. Higher Ed's best
2,Learned nothing in methods
4.5,Excellent Kiddie Lit teacher...really knows her stuff and makes it fun.
5,George Williams is one of the greatest guys out there. I took many classes with Willy G and always found his lectures to be very enjoyable.
2,Prof. Williams  ahh  what a man! A truly unique individual in that you would never know what random thought would pop out during class. Sometimes difficult to discern what material was being covered in class and his explainations were sometimes as clear as mud . . . not always helpful during office hours  but at least he would try to help.
2,where does the 'G' go  where the 'G' allways goes  where the danger is  where the George is.

4,Dr. Ochshorn is such a sweet lady. The class is based around 4 essays which are easy as long as you put in a little effort  then there are readings due every class with pop quizzes that are easy if you read (drops lowest quiz grade). Lectures can be a bit boring but  she always lets you out of class early. Sweet lady would recommend
1,Had to read up to 40-60 pages of boring travel pieces between EVERY class and only had 4 writing assignments. No one in the class did all of the reading cause it was a ridiculous amount. Everyone did poorly on quizzes. Barely got any feedback on our few assignments. Horribly boring class  not helpful at all  still got an A. Good luck with her...
3.5,A wonderful professor! She provides a clear outline of the course  and sticks to it! There are in-class readings and discussions for participation points. No exams  BUT a few pop quizzes - just read what she says to read! Research paper is 30% of your grade  but she lets you submit 2 drafts and she is there every step of the way if you need her!
2.5,"She can be rude to students and is a huge stickler for phones out in class and ""wandering out of the room"" (aka no bathroom breaks if you don't want the stink eye). Also HUGE on arriving on time. She takes attendance and if you're late she scolds you and sometimes gives pop reading quizzes which you can't take even if you're a few minutes late."
2.5,Unreasonable  super boring class  thinks her class is the only one you're taking  forces you to change things that are perfectly fine
5,I took her for fiction 1. Shes a great critic and will force you to improve your writing  but the class is not too hard. She also assigns great readings. Go to her office hours to work on your stuff with her. Shes even better one-on-one.
3.5,She is a good teacher to get for Eng 101. There are a lot of readings due for each class and the discussions can be really long and boring. She is really nice and helpful though. Four essays due- likes to see lots of changes between drafts  go to her office hours too she gives good feedback on papers. I would take her again.
4.5,small readings due every class  not long tho. 5 short 500 word essays but she grades them easily. she grades on how drastically you change your paper from the 1st draft to the last. She really likes a lot of changes. no tests. 1 final-essay
4,I took her for fiction writing I and she was really good. Attendance is mandatory but she is easy if you have an excuse. Very nice and helpful but dont take her if your looking to get an easy wri grade or if this isnt for your major. you do do ALOT of writing assignments & you have to read a couple short stories for every class. overall good teache
4,good class  she really cares about your grade  you get what you earn. and do the reading!
5,This is my favorite professor at UT. I loved her! Anyone who is an English major needs to take her just for the experience. She allows you to love the subject without being a jerk about grades. I actually learned from her.
5,Excellent professor  passionate about her subject.
1,If you ask questions  she acts as if you are stupid and expects you to know the answer. She's rude. She may need to stick with regular English 101 and not ENG 257.
4,No Comments
4.5,great professor.. shes an extremely nice lady and offers to look at your essays before she grades them to point out things you did wrong.. there are no tests.. there's a lot of reading and you have to write five papers.. all u do in class is pretty much discuss the readings.. shes a great professor and is extremely nice
5,Very nice prof and easy class to get a good grade if you do what she asks. Very easy to talk to and explains things clearly.
5,very smart and interesting lady.
5,Very nice lady! Some of the readings can get a little boring at times. Easy grader  very helpful in giving feedback on papers. Definitely take her for eng102
5,Awesome  very passionate and approachable. The class is pretty easy is you do the simple readings. The more you participate  the better you're grade  guaranteed!
5,great teacher  very nice  very helpful  i hate english in general but she is a good teacher :)
3,She is kind of a hippie but none the less as long as you attend and are involved you will get a good grade!
1.5,She never checks her email and uses outdated information. She also needs to grade on more than just attendance  I would suggest taking this class because its an interesting topic but NOT with her.
2,Poitless class. Learned absolutley nothing. attendance is a must dont miss 1 day or you will more then likely fail. otherwise class was xtreamly boring and her teaching style is dull.
1.5,Entirely attendance based. No emphasis on knowledge gained  and she talks about the exact same thing everyday. Either you have perfect attendance and you get a 4.0  or you miss days and get a 2.0.
3,VERY EASY. its all in attendance. really boring though. mid sem. exam you take in groups. only hard thing is your final paper which she does not go over. if you want a 4.0 take her.
3,Going to the lectures seemed completely pointless  she talks about the same things every day and it's hard to even stay awake. I felt like I wasted money and time being in her class and learned hardly anything.
5,I throughly enjoyed this class. Attendance is a must!! I learned alot from her.
3,If you like kindergarten teachers  you'll like her. She literally will pull you out of class if you've missed a day regardless of the circumstances. Don't take this class if you're far from campus  or in the winter for that matter because if you're late  it's your ass. Show up  and the class is mind numbingly easy. Waste of money.
5,She was very awesome  if you go to class and participate you WILL do well.... I never opened the book  got a 4.0. I also got 150/140 on the final paper. She just is extremly nice and helpful. I love her
2,She was a fairly easy teacher but all she seemed to ever talk about was attachments. She did not make the class interesting at all and did not make it very clear what we needed to know for the tests.
5,Very knowledgeable professional. Peg sets her students up for success. She is very helpful and wants her students to really learn about the subject material.
1,This is the worst teacher I have had in my 2 years as a full time student at L.C.C. She is undereducated and asks for class input but if you speak up and don't agree with her she will embarrass you in front of the class and make you feel stupid. She is completely ignorant and the other psych profs I have had at LCC have agreed that she is a bad pro
1,She has no idea what she's talking about  a complete bafoon. Do not take this class it is dull and she is obnoxiously uneducated on the subjects she is supposed to be teaching.
1,She was a TERRIBLE teacher! She had a VERY biased outlook on psychology and all she taught was attachment theory. She doesn't teach about the PROVEN methods of mental disorder reasons and treatments. Do not take her unless you want to learn incorrect information and want to be bored out of your mind.
5,She is a great woman with lots of experience in this field. You can know so much new and important stuff in her class  just by listening a lot and keeping your mind open. The class is not difficult  but very interesting. I do RECOMMEND to take this class  and I do RECOMMEND Margaret! She is very knowledgeable and nice!
3,Absolutely the WORST professor I have ever had. The class was boring to begin with and all based on attendance. I aced the entire thing but then when I turned in the paper somehow she gave me a zero because of some big mistake that she made. I tried to contact her about my grade and it took her a month to get back with me.
2,Did not like her  one of the worst teachers I've ever had. Very boring class  and don't waste your money buying the book because you'll never use it.
2,"The class is easy  you just have to show up. I was very dissappointed because I LOVE psyc classes  and she was an aweful teacher. Don't buy the book  it's a waste of money. The only thing she will teach you all semester is ""attachment theory"" Overall  a bad teacher"
5,She's easy ...just go to class
1.5,"This class was ridiculous. I usually enjoy my PSYC classes and teachers but I cannot say the same for ""Peg"". She is odd  repititive  hard headed and very dull. Just avoid this teacher and you shouldn't have a problem. Spending $80 on a book was **** because we never used it and the semester project was annoying because she is so damn picky."
4,English with Greta is very laid back. She's a good teacher and likes to engage the class a lot. I wouldn't say she's a hard grader but you get what you put in. She really likes participation and gives reading assignments for homework. The reading can be boring but isn't too long. It's very possible to receive an A in her class.
4.5,Greta was a really nice  laid-back  accessible  funny english teacher. I never felt like I was necessarily her student  or that I was in an english class  because she cares about engaging all of her students in their education  treating us as adults. She will be more than help you on essays or whatever  so GO TO HER OFFICE HOURS!! An easy A.
5,I had to write a review after all the not-so-flattering ones that we posted about Greta. She's an amazing teacher  who is nice  accessible  wants to help  and is easy to talk to. Go to her office hours and she'll tell you what to write for your essays. No homework  to tests or quizzes  no mid-term  just 5 essays. Take Greta :)
2,no comment
4.5,Greta was very helpful! She can come on intimidating  but has sincere care and concern for her students. She is tough for our own good. I came away from the class wtih an A and am positive  that taking the course will be my reason for many A's to come. Don't let the other comments scare you.
2,You have to play up to Greta if you want to get to teach 99. Then you have to take this course which the course was a waste of time.
4.5,she is really helpful if you ask for it. very interested in what you write about and is great when it comes to editing a rough draft so you can improve. she has helped me to improve my writing skills so much! she expects a lot out of her student so dont slack off. but she doesnt expect something of you unless she believes it can be done.
3.5,Greta can been intimidating from the start. But she is an incredibly knowledgeable instructor who really does want her students to engage and interact with the material. If you get past the intimidation  you can learn a lot from her.
2,Horrible. English is my favorite subject  and I hated this class with a passion. She will tell you not to do something in your paper  then take points off becuase of it. A lot of the class failed. Try not to take her if you can help it
1.5,She's just a poor teacher  no social etiquette and made me dislike my favorite subject......
2,I love English  I spend my free time writing and have always prided myself on my writing skills. She made me hate this class. Her attitude towards her students is similar to 1st graders. Her 101 class is pathetic and she only helps students that are basically failing instead of those that put fourth effort. I don't recommend this to ANYONE!
4.5,One of my favorites! I had her for two different classes. She's a great teacher and if you have any issues with her  just talk to her outside of class. She may not seem approachable but she's actually easy to talk with once you make the first move.
5,Greta is extremely concerned with her students's futures. My writing improved dramatically in her classes. Highly recommended for upper division english.
5,Fantastic teacher who is very interested in her students' futures.

1,"Worst teacher I ever had. Has no clue what he is talking about. He teaches a concept  decides it is wrong and reteaches it again but tests you on the ""wrong one"" I took Advanced Honors Physics in high school and got an A but struggled to get a C in this class. I basically self-taught in this class."
2,He is so confused. The guy just has no idea how to teach. There were many times when he would write a problem on the board  realize he did it incorrectly  and ended up erasing the whole thing and taking another 10 minutes to reteach it  and that was just one of the many problems in that class. If you value you what you're learning  do not take him.
2.5,His class is easy in the sense that it is easy to pass. it is very very hard to get a good grade but if you just want to pass  this is your guy
4.5,Dr. Liff is awesome. Really helpful. I had him for a summer course and it was really easy. You're able to be exempt from every test  including the final. If you took physics in high school  you'll be fine. He's one of the funniest teachers I've ever had. Definitely need to take him as a teacher.
2,Hes real funny in class  but the workload is intense  if you apply yourself you can get a good grade  but the tests are hard and the final is even harder
2.5,physics is hard. you must do all homewrk to understand. Highly recommended...get a tutor to help you do all the homework. The final exam is very very hard.
1.5,This guy sucks  he seems nice  but then doesnt help u at all  he leaves u to get a bad grade  dont take
5,He makes the difficult parts easier  u just have to pay attention on him!
4.5,he teaches pretty well. he really silly
4,This class is hard but Liff is a good teacher  just go to class and do the homework and you'll be fine for the tests. He's pretty funny and goes over the material multiple times  pretty fair grader too just don't miss any labs cause it'll kill your grade.
4.5,No Comments
5,He is a very encouraging professor. He is both serious and humorous about the course. He explained things clearly to make sure all understood.
3.5,Had physics in HS. It made the class super easy. Liff is a good guy  hard to understand at first  but def the one id recommend to take for this class. I didn't have a problem at all  got an A. He likes to crack really lame jokes  so get ready for some laughs.
2,Not Native english speaking. Very easy  tests are simple  goes over every problem. Not a lot of work or require must from you. Hard if don't come to class.
2.5,Always pronounced my name wrong... oh well. If I hadn't taken Phsyics in HS  the class would be super confusing - he needs a new teaching method. If you already had Physics  take this class and it'll be easy. If you haven't  take someone native to the US.
2,If you were good in physics in high school  good for you. This is so much harder! Had A's in h.s.  now barely passing. Does not give partial credit! grrr! not very helpful. thinks he's easy but he isnt. takes attendance everyday!
1,he is not easy and never trust you.do not take this class with him...
5,liff is the man! def take him if you can. sure the tests are hard  but he does try to give you partial credit and he gives out lots of extra credit. stay with it  he is always tyring to help out if you are behind.
1.5,I had him for a summer course at Penn and I thought he was pretty awful. He thinks he's a really good teacher  and he really isn't. He also really didn't care much about helping us. But he was easy  so I did get a good grade  and I did learn the basics
5,Awesome and funny teacher  repeats himself so that everyone understands which helps tremendously. Gives out lotsa extra credit. The tests were a little hard tho. Tests are not hard but difficult. Don't skip this class!! You'll miss a lot.
4,Very great teach  sad that he his leaving. One of my favorite professors & he is truly hilarious.
3.5,Mr. Curtright is a very good professor. I have taken both World History classes and I loved them both. He means business when it comes to studying and paying attention in class  but he is funny and down to earth when you get to know him. Sadly  the Fall 2014 semester was his last one teaching at TCC. I'm going to miss his class.
3.5,He's not the nicest guy but he is good at lecturing. If you can make yourself pay attention during lecture and study you should be able to pass. He gives outlines for lecture and the majority of his tests are the study questions on the lecture outlines. He's not the best but certainly not the worst.
1,This professor doesn't use the book  yet he expects you to read every page he assigns. The only grades he gives are for the four tests that hardly have anything to do with history or his lectures. His lectures are dull and I have fallen asleep on many occasions in his class. Unless you want to be bored to death - DO NOT TAKE HIM!
1,Unless you are a total history buff  this class is miserable. Ive never made anything lower than a B and I failed and had to withdraw. He drones  is a jerk when you ask questions and the only grades come from 4 tests which include written portion. Doesn't use board AT ALL  attendance is mandatory  book and outline don't connect.
3,"History. It's just not my area of expertise. For some  he drones. I found his sidebar commentary to be comical. However  tests yielded questions to see ""how engaged you were during lecture and your ability to take quality notes. Went to office  still didn't improve grade. All that I ask is that an instructor is fair and he is."
1.5,Curtright has got a great sense of humour but this class is lecture-based and unless you have prior knowledge on each topic you are pretty much going to sleep through them. It is nearly impossible to link the outlines to the text. He doesn't use the textbook for assignments but without supplement to his lectures you will do poorly in this course.
2.5,Teacher thinks he is hilarious and tries to get everyone to give him a courtesy laugh almost every minute of the class. His test grading is ridiculous. If you don't have his exact same opinion on the writing portion  you will fail.
2,If you find history boring - DO NOT take this instructor! He lectures the extensive material  tells you to read the book  no study guide  no test review  nothing to help out the students  he doesn't seem to care if you pass or fail  he just likes to talk about history. Very dry and boring lecture style.
4.5,An old fashioned lectures-only teacher. Stands up there with an old projecter that uses transparencies  and just drones on the whole time. Nice guy though  knows his stuff and teaches it well. No homework  either. If you are good with just an occasional test  and can show up every day and pay attention  he's pretty great.
2.5,First and foremost  he's the stereotypical professor that stands in front of class and just talks at you until time is up. Even though I like history  it was pretty boring. You never have homework  though  it's just lectures and tests. I didn't mind him  but I certainly didn't want to take his class again.
3,I took him for WOH and EUH for history  didn't want any other professor than him. I like his lecturing but i wish he puts a mini quiz towards every class so we could get more pts. I never bought the book and passed both of his class with a C. 3 exams  no finals 300 points maximum. Attendance is mandatory so don't miss out!
3.5,"There's not doubt he's passionate about his subject and his multiple choice portions are fairly easy. However  memorizing the entire history the Roman Empire will get you no more than a C on his exams  he's so strict. I once told him perhaps I was studying incorrectly and if there's something I should focus on  he said: ""Just study."" o.O?"
1,Not interesting very rude at times. Will not take again.
4,Take his class  if only because it's super easy. All you really have to do is show up and remember enough to pass three (very simple) exams. I notice most of the negative reviews here have to do more with him as a person than his teaching: yes  he is a snarky  elitist old conservative Papist  but he adds some fascinating commentary.
3.5,I passed his class with a B. He was unpleasant at times and his teaching style was very old-world. He did have a unique take on history (anti-American  anti-Atheist  anti-Lutheran  etc.  compared early Christians to hippie welfare bums). He is very full of himself but his class isn't too hard to pass if you take decent notes. Easy tests.
3.5,He is a wonderful teacher  and very enthusiastic about history. I took his express woh2012 this past fall and passed with a B. He is lecture based so don't interrupt the class wait until after the class. You really don't need the textbook but I would advise to attend class and be a good note taker! I will definitely be taking him in the 2nd hist.
5,He wont answer questions during lecture  wait until after class to ask any. Read the book as he does refer to it but the book lacks certain detail. Great guy if you attend class and pay attention his class is easy and he is willing to help anyone if they ASK for it!
5,Very enthusiastic about the class  gets into detail with major places or characters in history.
4.5,I would recommend this class. His test is super easy because he gives you most of the questions in the study guide but the essay part is really hard! Its pretty easy to get a B. He takes attendance but is pretty lenient. I would recommend going to every class however. I liked him!
2,He is probably one of the worst professors I've had. He's horrible at explaining what will be on the test  spends the entire class period just doing examples but never fully explains the subject. This class should have been easy  and all of my friends who have a different professor are doing good  but because he's a bad teacher I'm not doing well.
1,Prof Abert is definitely a prof I will never take again  nor will I recommend him to anyone. I ended up catching the flu and missed the first test and he never responded to any of my emails and when I returned and asked to make up the test he said no and walked away. The test I did take had 10 questions. Also  be prepared for nonstop homework...
4,Incredibly helpful if you have questions.
1,This is by far one of my worst math teachers in my entire life. Does not explain many things on the tests. Loncapa is much more difficult than it should be since it does not give you the right answer when trying to teach the math to yourself. I highly recommend not taking this class with him. Any other teacher is probably a better option.
5,Hes a thorough instructor. If your a math or engineering major hes your guy. If not  like I am not  then he is not your guy. Got an A but he defiantly makes you work for it. Will ensure you are prepared for future math classes.
2,Entire class consists of him doing examples. He might briefly talk about the concept to introduce it. Homework is on LonCapa which is the worst! If you bring him the question  he'll do it for you though. Tests are alright if you review. He's a good person  but not the best teacher. Trig is hard  and he doesn't really make it easier. No book needed.
4,Abert is a genuinely nice person and shows enthusiasm. He will only invest in you if he sees that you invest yourself in learning the material. This is math people  you are inevitably going to practice constantly in order to fully grasp what you are learning. The hw problems aren't ever too challenging. If you do the hw the tests should be eazy.
5,I love math it's easily my favorite subject. This professor is very passionate and does an excellent job of explaining things. I'm not a fan of liberal arts math because I hate word problems  he does an amazing job teaching and it was np for me. Attendance isn't mandatory but I took it as express and if you skip  you will easily fall behind.
4,Professor Abert was an all around decent professor for Calc 2. He struggles in teaching you new material right off the bat  and typically expects that you will have read the section being covered in class before hand. He doesn't curve or drop lowest test grade  but he is a very easy grader on tests  and gives a lot of partial credit on problems.
5,No comment. He is awesome. if not  you are not doing what you have to do for a math class. Do not complain you teacher.
3,He is very knowledgeable and explains the material well  but his lecture can seem never-ending and his homework problems are a lot harder than the ones he goes over in class. They are also very long (some with 40 questions) but he gives you normally over a week to complete. I would suggest taking MWF to have shorter lectures or else you'll zone out
5,get ready to take notes. he writes them all on the black boards and doesn't post anything online. If you miss class you wont have any idea what's going on unless you go to his office hours
4,Professor Abert was a good professor. He teaches a little fast in my opinion but he is very knowledgeable. He takes attendance but does not give any in class quizzes. 10% of your grade is online LONCAPA and this alone will teach you everything you need to pass the class. He does not give study guides for the tests but you can just review LONCAPA.
5,Good at explaining new material. Moves at the perfect pace. Will answer any of your questions perfectly. Tests are a lot easier than the home works. Gives partial credit on tests. Tests are only 45% of the grade so if you fail one dont worry.
4,great teacher  going to his office hours is very helpful because he is willing to go over and workout any problem you ask him too. lots of homework but it prepares you for the test. pretty funny. tests are based on the homework  very fair grader. . don't skip class. this class will not be an easy A. study and do your work and you will get an A.
2,He is a great teacher do not get me wrong  but he is teaching format is for students who clearly grasp the concept of math! i am terrible at math and i did terrible in this class! DO ALL HOMEWORKS! ATTEND ALL CLASSES! If you are good at math i advise you take this class because it may be easier for you.
2,Awful professor. This was his first time teaching an MGF class and it clearly showed.
5,He is a Mathematics man. Awesome. I had him for precal and will take him all of myh maths if I can
1,Don't do it unless you are familiar with Mac 1105. I'm a straight A student & had a difficult time. Test seem to have nothing to do with what you've studied. Don't normally rate professors unless necessary Nice person  but has a cocky  show off style of teaching. If you're not somewhat familiar with Mac 1105  DON'T DO IT  YOU'LL REGRET IT.
2,Mr. Abert was not my favorite professor. There were times that he would preform examples in lecture wrong  and he could not correct them. The lectures were unclear and hard to follow. Also  the tests were very hard compared to examples we had done in class and after talking to classmates  it was a communal feeling that we were not prepared for them
5,make 7 copies of the practice exam and continue doing it until your successful. make copies of the lessons and do along with her videos. in lab do all homework first then your quizzes. Your quizzes are what's on the test so practice the unit exam too.
5,Ms. Dameron is very clear with what is expected and how she grades. She emails how-to videos regularly  provides good notes and worksheets  and offers online students to come to campus to study with that class for tests. She wants you to learn and pass. She's the best teacher I've had at TCC.
5,Mrs. Dameron is a wonderful teacher. She makes it easy and fun to pass her class. Anyone who need to take math class should take it with her.
1,She is nice and wants you to pass but none of her lectures match up to the work that you have to do for MyMathLab. I am taking an online only class and it is probably the hardest thing I have ever taken since I've start college two years ago. Her lectures do not help and you will have to spend most of your time looking for other lessons online.
5,Professor Dameron is an excellent professor. If you do the work  you will succeed. Professor Dameron wants you to succeed. She is very fair. I took her online class and was quite please. Recommend her highly!!!!!!
4,"i sutdy online make sure your keep with your online work  the test are a reflection of your homework there were no surprises. its def possible to get an easy ""a"" in the class just do your work"
5,Professor Dameron wants you to succeed! You must do the work and put forth the effort. If you do what she asks  you will succeed! Great class and great professor!
5,she is awesome  lets you retake your lowest grade for the final if you want to  she gives great videos! Im not good at math at all and I understood it with her!
5,I've taken multiple math classes at TCC over and over again because they are so difficult for me to pass. I should have just taken MGF1106 and 1107 with Dameron from the beginning. She got me to pass math  and actually enjoy it too. She is an Amazing professor! Take her if math is a struggle for you!!
5,Outstanding teacher! One of the best math teachers I have ever had. 4 tests and online hw/quizzes. If you attend class you will easily pass
5,Very thorough. Don't sleep on the index cards she gives out  they REALLY work. She allows a retake if needed. Very fair and wants everyone to succeed. One of the best instructors at TCC. She's a gem!
4,Ms.Dameron is one of the best teachers that Ive had @ TCC. She is very patient and will work with you. I absoultely HATE math  but Ms. Dameron made the class tolerable. My suggestion would be to take her!
5,3rd time taking this  others I made D's if you don't understand she takes time & patiently walks you through it. HW/quizzes can be retaken until you get a grade you're happy with. At the end of the semester if you aren't happy with one of your test grades  retake it  if you are happy with all grades you don't have to go to class the last few days.
4.5,I took the main summer ONLINE class. It was great for a math-which I really do not like. You use course compass  she uses scanned PowerPoints to teach the sections. But I really just looked over them and focused on the textbooks chapter videos they help  because it shows step by step. Great class  but online is a lot of work  but very do-able!
5,Wonderful teacher! I have disliked math for many years  but Mrs. Dameron helped tremendously....I would take her class again...
5,She is a wonderful teacher. She makes everything crystal clear and always returns email. I am taking her online.I see her once a week with any questions I have a she has helped me. All you have to do is cc and 4 tests. At the end of the semester you can retake the lowest test so you make a better grade and do the extra credit that she gives.
5,She is the sweetest teacher ever. She will help you out any chance she gets. But U WILL EARN EVER SINGLE GRADE U GET N HER CLASS!!If u want to earn extra credit u better do all the extra credit assignments she give u..if not she will not be giving u no extra points to move a letter grade.But overall she is the best teacher ever!!
5,Extremely helpful and will go out of her way to help you understand the concepts. Offered extra credit opportunities with the first 3 tests and replaced lowest test grade with the final (if final is higher). As long as you put forth effort you should do great in her class.
5,She is the sweetest professor and most helpful math teacher I have ever had! TRUST ME take her! Ive always been horrible at math intill this semester!She will work any problem you need anytime gives easy EC and test are JUST like study guide!! EASY and NICE!!:)
5,Love this teacher! She's great. She explains everything clearly and works with you if you have any questions. She gives out extra credit for all the tests  and the tests themselves are exactly what she goes over. There are no surprises. I've taken her twice now  and she's been amazing both times. Definitely take her  you won't be disappointed!!
5,Defiantly recommend!. took him for my western humanities  and signing up with him again for east/west humanities. Explains everything very clearly  and sets a good pace. Very nice teacher
5,Just plain out HELPFUL   &   GREAT teacher!!!:O) tAKE him u wont regret it.
5,Mr Unger is a great teacher! I took his online class for HUM 2210. He states everything clearly as far as deadlines  and objectives. He is understanding and helpful. I would do a few quizzes a week and reviewed those for the final and passed. Turn the Journals in on time they are a great portion of your points. Very self paced  relaxed class!
5,Excellent teaher highly reccomended. I took his online class. You can work ahead and you do not have to go to the testing center. 2 essays and a final. you will need the text books so get them.
5,Took web class... great teacher and awesome class! HWs super easy (straight from book) and a few journals and DBs. No deadlines for HWs. Very self-paced. Very responsive if you need help! Only test is final (multiple choice at home). Can tell he really enjoys what he teaches. Take this class!!
5,Took web class... great teacher and awesome class! HWs super easy (straight from book) and a few journals and DBs. No deadlines for HWs. Very self-paced. Very responsive if you need help! Only test is final (multiple choice at home). Can tell he really enjoys what he teaches. Take this class!!!
5,Mr.Unger is a really good teacher and his Online class was great. I would recommend him to anyone. His online REL2300 class was very easy and self paced. Journals kind of difficult but not really. other than that. Great teacher and he also explains to you why he gave the grade he did. Really good. TAKE HIS CLASS =)
4.5,I took his HUM 2210 and his class is hard to fail all you have to do is complete the assignments which for the most part are open book quiezzes and they are not timed so TAKE HIM
5,Professor Unger was very clear about his expectations and good about communication. The material was laid out in a manner that you could work at your own pace for the most part. The journal was tough but that is because it required a LOT of introspection. Study guide for final was awesome. I enjoyed the class a great deal.
5,"Taking the online class. It is really well structured. The first quiz to take is a quiz on the syllabus  so he assures the student has a clear understanding of the expectations for the class (repeatable quiz). An ""A"" is quite attainable  so long as you don't let yourself fall behind. Follow the suggested timeline. Great course!"
5,Marc is a great instructor with a true passion for philosophy (they class I took with him). But  MARC!!!! Commas are your FRIENDS!!!! (and your students' too!)
3.5,WEB class: hardly used the sucky book  just lookedup the answers online. Didn't really do much  but post a discussion (which he LOVES) as little as possible and guessed my way through the tests. He answers all your questions promptly.
4,Took the web course  it was a challenge since there is a lot of information/history to remember. Otherwise it's interesting enough that learning it wasn't too bad. All tests/quizzes were online and open book. Writing project was time-consuming and tedious. Best part was not stepping foot on campus to complete this course.Self motivated students onl
5,Web-based: I wish most teachers designed their web-based classes like Mr. Unger. He was thorough  clear  and creative in how he got us participating as a group. I learned morea about my classmates in this class than in a traditional class! Read  study  interract  and take the open-book quizzes and tests. You will pass w/an A with a little effort.
4.5,"Well  this guy is as dry as a piece of sandpaper. If you have ever seen the guy from the ""clear eyes"" commericials he reminds me of him. But  having said all that his class is not difficult  I made a B and didn't do to much. He lectures off powerpoint and the test comes direcetly off that. He also gives 2 10 min. breaks for the 3 hour class."
4.5,"Mr. Unger is a thorough professor. His method of teaching requires detailed  well developed answers. His final exam was difficult  specifically the exam questions  but he offers them prior to. He does not offer extra credit  but is helpful when a question arises. An ""A"" is attainable  but the student must work for it."
4.5,Interesting class  lots of notes but you can print powerpoint off blackboard and take it to class. tests and paper were easy but final was difficult. if you miss one class  you miss a lot. i would definatley reccomend this class.
5,I took the web class. The class itself was very easy with online exams you can take as many times as you need. The only thing I hated was the final. Four essay questions at 250 words each and about 50 multiple choice. All based on previous test & paper. WAY too much to remember for a final.
5,"Very interesting class  super fair tests  very pleasant professor. Not an easy ""A"" but attainable. Go to class and start your journals early and you shouldn't have any trouble passing. Unger seems like a genuinly nice guy."
5,All in all  a very good professor. The lecture can get pretty boring at times  but  it's all very clear and structured and there are never any surprises. If you go to class and pay attention  you will do well. Also  his sense of humor rules.
2,I have never met a Professor who is so rude and condescending to students. She would humiliate students in my class on a regular basis. Obviously thinks the world of herself...talks about herself constantly. Very harsh grading and gives TONS of very dry reading. I would never recommend a class with her.
4.5,Prof. Neves taught this class in the summer. The daily 4-hour format led to a challenging class with a huge amount of reading  but the class was wonderfully stimulating. Prof. Neves's in-class discussion format causes students to think. Take her class if you can. You will learn a lot if you do the work needed to learn.
1.5,She is completely rude and difficult to understand. She is not helpful nor gracious.
4.5,Andrea Neves was one of the best professors I ever had. She taught me that if you have high expectations  you'll get high performance. She is a fighter for students who are disadvantaged because of their socioeconomic backgrounds. She is simply an amazing woman.
1.5,I'm surprised she is still teaching. Evidently she hasn't improved in the last 30 years. I took a Mexican-American studies class from her in the 1970's. I was very interested in the subject  but I have to say  she was the worst professor I have ever had in my entire academic career. What a miserable  arrogant  condescending person.
1,if you want to hate yourself for an entire semester then i highly recommend her class.
1.5,B----!! This lady has a stick up her Stanford behind. Unless you are previously from Stanford  or really care about Stanford  do not take her class! If you HAVE TO  write any essays about Stanford graduates and repeat exactly what she has said in class.
4.5,She is used to teaching Stanford students and she is hard but if you do the reading and participate in class she is not that bad. I was not a great student and I walked away with an A in the class. Do the HW and don't let her intimidate you.
1,No Comments
1.5,She is hostile  defensive  patronizing  inflexible  unsympathetic and mean. She seems to actively dislike students. If she doesn't know the answer  she'll ignore your question or pretend that she does.
1,she was the worst professor I have ever had in my four years in college.
1.5,She is the devil! If you don't agree with her  you are wrong and will suffer the consequences.
3,TERRIBLE boring class. She's sort of pissy  and not cool...
4,No Comments
1.5,No Comments
3.5,This class is no joke. He give 6 tests the whole semester and drops the lowest test score. If u do the extra credit that's 11 points. So if u have 69% and did all the extra credit you'd have a B in the class. He is pretty helpful if you go to his office. The class is hard as hell..i wouldnt take the class again.if u like science this will be ya boy
3,I like him  jolly fellow. But he does run through things a tad quickly. The class itself is hard. You cannot half ass this course. STUDY.
4,Mr Daniels is a very nice man. He uses all of his time wisely and if you attend class regularly you won't be surprised by the different quizzes he assigns. He has an outline for every unit test. One thing to know is that there are things on the test that are not on the outline. You nerd the book to do really well on the tests.
5,He is a very nice teacher. He knows his material and he teaches well. I would recommend him to anyone. He makes jokes but they aren't always funny. He gives outlines for every unit. Tests are kind of tough
3.5,He is a very nice teacher and willing to work with every student. he gives alot of extra credit. go to class every day and take good notes  use the outline. make sure to study very hard for the tests though. he is funny and classes are interesting
1,He is all over the place and it is very difficult to tell where he is at in the lecture so you can't really keep up. Would not recommend to ANYONE. The ONLY good thing about him is that he gives a little extra credit.
5,"I am surprised at the low ratings for this prof. He is really a good teacher  if you pay attention & take good notes. Just study for the exams & it is an easy class! He is very helpful  offers extra credit & his lectures are interesting. He is clear in his speech & is the content is very understandable. It is an easy ""A"" if you prepare for exams."
3,Decent class. Make sure you print out all the notes and write in the margins to study. There are 5 tests and he drops the lowest grade if you take all 5. Kinda funny sometimes. Gives some extra credit.
1,PURE HOT GARBAGE
4,"He is a nice guy  offers extra credit and is willing to help. However he isn't that clear when he speaks because he talks fast and confuses himself at times. For the tests he simply says ""read the chapters  look at the outline  look at the tables  do the learning outcomes  and the chapter quizzes""...not very helpful and its a lot to study!!!"
3,Didn't like this class at all.
5,He is such a great teacher and loves what he does. Simply print out the guidelines and write simple notes in the margin and study it  you have at least a B in the class. He is such a nice guy and makes a lot of jokes. I would recommend him to anyone. Oh  and he drops one test grade if you take all 5.
3.5,You really need to go to class everyday. Whoever says that he is a bad teacher is probably one of those slackers that never come to class. If you come to class  take notes  and ask questions when you have them you'll do fine. I hate biology  and I got a B. Seriously  I would definitely recommend taking him if your a hard worker.
3.5,whoever is saying he doesnt offer extra credit is a bold faced lie its even on the syllabus...you prbly never showed up to earn any EC...or even read it...ill admit i struggled but he always said come to office and he showed exactly where the answer was on our outlines he printed out..ive been outta high school 16yrs and got a B!
3.5,mr daniels seems hard at first..but contrary to what you read you can easily get a B or an A...he has no homework only 5 tests 1 final that is the same weight of the tests & drops the lowest test score..offers 10 points extra credit that he adds to your grade so if you have a 70 add those 10 points u get a B.the extra credit is simple! he is corny
4,Really good teacher  plenty of extra credit.I enjoyed going to class and that rare. so far is one of the best teachers ive had at tcc.
5,WOW ok.... 1st of all  the people that say he's a bad teacher are just dumb people plain and simple. You probably could just read and look at the outline and still get an A in the class. He is ALWAYS willing to help you  breaks the material down so a 3rd grader could understand  and above all he's an awesome guy! My favorite teacher at TCC byfar
4.5,He isn't anything special that for sure. Sits there and reads everything from a powerpoint. I showed up on the test days  and thats it. Studied from the book. The grading is pretty easy  there are five tests and a final all worth 100 points and you get to drop the lowest test grade for a total of 500 points. So you can bomb one test and be fine.
1,Bottom line: dont take him! he's an idiot and you will know less walking out than you did walking in. Grade is all test  no EC or HW. Doesn't give a crap about his students. You will be teaching yourself 100%.
3,every test we have taken i went to his office and he was able to show me on the outline where the answer was. True there are no assignments but there is optional extra Credit if U do all of them it will raise your final grade a whole letter grade. U have to study isn't that why you're in school? It is not an EASY A but he is more than fair. D'Bora
5,Very real professor who gives no BS. She tells you the way it is and what the history really was like. She gives her opinion (which tend to be very strong)  but hears other peoples opinions and respects them. Learned so many great things from this class and professor
1,I've previously taken the online course to avoid the in class nonsense. Didn't make a difference with her grading and lack of communication (emails). Never the less  Jenni expects the most out of her students. No excuses are tolerated. You'll read 4 books in 1 semester . If you don't complete the book reviews you will fail. Honesty doesn't matter
5,Expect to read 4 novels during this course. No textbook  but she puts all relevant readings online for students. Expect to have to read an article and answer questions as homework for every class. Most of your grade comes from the extremely important book reports. Most class periods are spent gathering in a large circle and discussing as a class.
1,Im not sure if she knows this  but not everyone who takes their class is majoring in history. She requires a ridiculous amount of work for an introductory class. I dropped her class within a week after i realized her attitude and extensive reading and other assignments. AND a school counselor advised me not to take her  so dont even
1,Just the worst.
1,DO NOT TAKE HER. I hated her class and dreaded going. Not only was it a waste of time but also a waste of money. I learned nothing. She never went over the class material  she talked basically current events the whole time when this was a class about the 1800's. Expected to read 4 chapter books on top of all the other articles she assigned.
2,Lots of book reading but not much else.
1,She is super strict. If you do not complete something  be ready to be kicked out of class. She thinks her class is the only thing going on in our life's. She assigns mass amounts of homework to be due immediately. Random pop quizzes are huge. If you think you can come to class and review what you just read  forget it. You should know everything!
2.5,Will never take this class again. If you're not a die hard history lover  trust me  DON'T TAKE THE CLASS. You'll regret it real quick.
1.5,She doesn't care about any excuses. If you miss a book review or a test expect a 0. She makes you read 4 books in one semester.
2.5,I got an A in the class  but i hated going to class. I dreaded it. When we were in class we didn't even talk about history majority of the time. You have to read four chapter books and do a book review. Those are your tests. If you don't read  you won't pass. The quiz's were a pain. She gives so much info  that it is hard to get ready for a quiz.
3.5,Lots of homework  but the homework is really easy. Tests were rare and not very hard.
5,Great teacher. Do the work and you will get an A. Slack off and you will fail  just like any other class.
5,She is an awesome teacher. When asked for help she will give it. Her classes are always interesting and though she strays sometimes she always incorporates the topic of the day.
1,Terrible teacher. We spent all class discussing current events instead of the history we're suppose to be studying. You basically have to teach yourself the material. The only time she goes over it is AFTER you take the exam on it. At that time what's the point anymore? Also she gives tons of homework. I love history but  this was a bad experience.
4.5,Take this class! She gives you all the homework and tests in advance. You do need to use the book  but only because the answers are right there. You don't need to read it  she gives you the page numbers. The tests aren't hard (open book/internet). There is something due every week  but it's not a lot. And you can work ahead. Recommend this class.
4.5,For a summer online class this was easy. She lets you work ahead  you only have 1 project/paper and she gives you optional due dates. I think she's pretty easy  but like all online classes  you have to do a bit of work (1 quiz a week  1 discussion and one Exam) But most of them are easy  and at your own pace (not timed!) Nice summer class.
2,I would not recommend her  at least not for an online class. She doesn't respond to emails in a reasonable amount of time and she is not very helpful. She also makes turning assignments in much more difficult than it needs to be. This is the worst online class I've ever taken.
2,I will never take another online class again because of her.
4,Took a while to email back  but overall loved it!
1.5,tedious
4.5,It was a lot of work  especially the outlining. And her tests and quizzes were pretty hard. But she was super helpful and very nice. Though it was hard I loved her as a teacher. I am horrible at History but I actually got an A in this class. You just have to be willing to put in the effort and you can get an A. Most in my class also got an A.
4,I don't know why everyone seems to hate her  I liked her. Yes  she is a hard teacher  and yes  she requires quite a bit of writing  but this is college  not primary school. And as far as an A being impossible  that is so wrong. I got an A. Maybe honor students are held to higher standards  or maybe you were just too lazy to do all of the work.
1,You mean she's still there? I had her back in late 90's and was a nightmare then  I dropped the class and took a different section later on.
1,"I called this my ""assumed"" history class because of the number of times she said ""I think this is what probably happened even though that's not what the book says."" Also she had us outlining the chapters and then lecturing on the same material it really was overkill for a topic as basic as US history."
1,GO FIND ANOTHER CLASS  IF THERE IS A WARNING BELL IN YOUR HEAD LET IT SOUND OUT NOW. ANY STUDENT WOULD BE BETTER OFF BUYING THE BOOK AND READING IT AT HOME.
1,"I had this woman as a substitute teacher in jr. high and high school and she was even worse when given her own class. She gave me a ""C"" on what was a ""B"" level paper simply due to the fact that she didn't agree my opinions or those of my sources. She feels that any opinion she doesn't share is wrong and isn't possible in the realm of real world."
1.5,Will never take another class from her. Thinks the whole world ishes and evrone should kiss up to her. She needs to get with it!
1,there is no possible way to get an A in her class  and Im an honors student.
2,OH MY GOD!! This class was an absolute disaster for me to go to! Note taking is not an easy task in her class since she goes off topic so much! Also  when you are taking her tests  be prepared to do more writing than you would in a creative writing class. I DO NOT suggest this class for anyone!
1.5,lectures straight from the text. boring. unclear on directions- likes to keep the class confused. a jr. college sistructor who wishes she was at the university- made the class hand in multiple works cited pages with guidelines more stringent than advanced english classes. she needs a life.

2,doesn't explain things well.

5,very kind
5,John made class fun & interesting.He was an awesome teacher that will be missed by many. He touched the lives of all his students and had a big impact on all of us. Kish lost an icredible teacher this month.
1,WORST TEACHER
2,I went into this class excited because I'm one of those losers that actually likes architectural history. Mourna is the worst professor  if you think you study hard you're wrong. I've never had a class that was as awful as this one and I cried a lot. If you want to talk to the professor she has a pretty interesting life but don't take the class
3,Morna is so very sweet  I would love to talk to her about other matters than that of design or drawing. A great person with a lovely smile  but not exactly the best professor. Her directions for assignments are always different for each class it seems. She's helpful  but I don't think she always knows how to say what the best way to do something is
1,She's an extremely sweet women  but does not know how to direct students on learning to draw better without confusing them. Several times when an assignment was given  people would do it wrong and have to redo it for the next class.
1,If you find out that you have her as a professor for either design or drawing you need to immediately request changing classes. She should have retired 20 years ago
2.5,Very hard to follow  slide presentations are unlabeled  making images difficult to identify (crucial for exams). Tough grader  but the tests are doable. The case study was a nightmare. While Morna was willing to help through email and meeings  her criticism was never constructive or helpful. Make sure you use the TA!
2,Morna's a really sweet old lady but if you don't have a TA in the class then you'll have no idea what's going on or what to expect out of projects. Our TA basically translated everything to us individually after she tried explaining it as a whole. She really is pretty knowledgable about design but she doesn't realize that we don't know anything yet
1,Livingston is probably one of the worst teachers at PhilaU. Not only does she not teach  she grades extremely hard on the 2 test you have and fails the entire class. She is not a historian or a architect teaching architecture history. Do not take her class if you want to pass this course. highly unrecommend.
2,She's a very nice person  quite old but seems to have a good head on her shoulders. Teacher wise- she's not very good. She never explains thorougly and never answers questions. She gets easily disappointed in your work because it's not what she wants. Highly unrecommended
1.5,she never gives constructive feedback only negative feedback i didn't learn anything from her class. so if you want to learn don't take her.
1,The worst teacher I've ever had. She wasn't even challenging  just rude. Completely unfair  not understanding  and judgemental. emphasis on MENTAL. I loved design  and accelled in it  but her class ruined my passion. she needs to retire  desperately. don't take her class. she's old and fake.
3,Morna is great  she is extremely knowledgable  and pleasant. An excellent resource inside and outside the classroom.
2,She's okay but she assumes that you already know what to do for stuff  when you don't  and acts disappointed when it's wrong. She's really confusing but if you catch her on a good day she's nice. Pray to God that you have a T.A. in her class or you're screwed though
3.5,morna is one of the nicest most interesting ppl in the world. she has good stories but they dont always relate to what youre doing. she doesnt always make it clear what she wants but if you dont give her what she wants she will tell you and help you make it better. do your work and care about it and she will be nice during crits usually.
3,Morna is a great woman but as a professor...i don't know if i would have gotten by without the TA there to clarify and helf with everything. with a TA...she's good  without a TA...not so much.
2.5,She is the worst teacher ever. Shes old a senile and not very helpful. Shes a photographer of Architecture not an architect  therefore she doesnt know much about actual architecture.
4,morna knows what she is talking about and has alot of knowledge in the design industry. She may not be as forceful as other teachers but she still helps out if you ever need it and will work with you outside of class which alot of other teachers don't do. I would recomend her for design 1or 2!!
1,nice woman  most of the time  but sucks as a teacher  do not take  she is very feminist too
3.5,good teacher. werk hard and she'll smile during ur crit  listen  then let u sit. bring in a piece of shyt model  expect her to get out of her seat  pick up ur piece of shyt n destroy it. do ur werk n u'll like her  if she asks for 15 analysis drawings do 5 and jus ask her 4 help. u never need to do as much werk that she originally asks 4
1,Morna is a very nice woman but she doesnt like your first design for pretty much all projects even when you do exactly what the handout says. Also  she doesnt give much feedback during the process but when it come to the crit  she is full of negative things to say about your work.
5,Great history professor and always prepared for class. Easy to talk to and is willing to help if you need it. Take Grout hes one of the best history profs
5,He's traveled all over so classes are cool because he's actually been where he's talking about. Passionate about what he does and doesn't ramble. Fair and friendly. As far as his tests you have to know your stuff so study and you'll do fine. Def the model professor!
5,There is a reason Grout is so loved on campus. He is a kind man with immense knowledge and passion for architecture and teaching. While he is one of the easiest History of Arch professors  students are happier and generally more interested in learning with him than in other classes. A wonderful man who every teacher should aspire to emulate.
5,Great teacher  took him for design 1 and 2  wish i could have taken him for history of architecture  he is so helpful. doesn't put u down  although he will tell you what ur doin could be better
4,Great teacher. Very easy and helpful. Makes stuff interesting. Great guy. TAKE HIM best decision ever
5,He is the best design teacher ever!!!! He knows what he's talking about and makes you feel good about your work (as long as you have it done). He only teaches Design I &II so take him while you can!!!
5,best design teacher ever!!!! take his class!!! instead of criticizing  he helps you grow as a designer and improve your ideas.... best ever!!
5,Grout is the greatest design teacher. he makes u look at ur design  then take it and will help u to see things that u missed to make it better. if u have the oppertunity to take Grout DO IT  he will change the way u look at things.
5,def the BEST design teacher no lie
5,hes the man
2.5,"if its not Greek its not that important. hey can you guys see this slide? oh forget it it doesn't matter (asian arch.) spends 10-15 fixing lighting in order to show greek arch. quote: ""these people blah blah.. This is grotesque"" very closed minded inconsiderate.but he may be a good design professor."
5,GREAT GUY!!! lectures are informative and interesting  he know ALOT and throws in contextual trival for fun. really nice and not too hard if you pay attention
5,whoever gave grout a :( must be a terrible design  grout is the greatest man on earth  and a modle teacher
5,Excellent professor  very helpful  but very hard grader.
2.5,he claimed it was an easy course  but ended grading very hard and ridiculously. grading sytem was horrible. also favored boys over girls. i do not recommend him!
5,nice  really helpful  lots of fun
1.5,he offered me absolutely no help in the class. i learned less from him than from any teacher i have ever taken. I DO NOT RECOMMEND HIM !!!
5,Grout has to have been the best professor I have had here. I am in my 3rd year here and still touch base with him. He was a great help my first year at college and  as someone has stated  is a very valuable asset to this college.
5,The most helpful  considerate  and informative professor here at Philau. I had him for 2 years and wish I was still in his class. You'll learn more from Grout and will enjoy his classes  even the 8 am class.
5,Professor Grout is a asset to this university  there arent many people out there that are as good at what they do like he is. take him  the atmosphere of his class is awesome
5,He changed my life for the better.
4,Prof. Coleman was an amazing man. A great professor indeed. He had high expectations and kept students working hard for a good grade. College isnt supposed to be easy. Thank you for the stories  memories  and belief in myself. You were an amazing man that cared for his students and their future and may your legacy live on.
4.5,Terrible loss for the English Department at SSU. My heart goes out to his family~
5,A sad loss for Sonoma State. Truly the best at the entire institution.
2,This guy  not even sure where to start. He's smart and sometimes funny  but is unclear and gives difficult assignments. Doesn't clarify what he wants
4,Favorite professor ever. Took his class for GE and it blew my mind. Those who do not like hard work should stay away  there are plenty of classes you can take and sleep through. If all my classes had been as challenging and thought provoking as the one class I took with Coleman  my college years would have been amazing. Bravo!
2,He is not clear at all. He asks for your questions but does not respond well to them. He goes off on tangents that do not seem to relate to the point and some how you are supposed to make a connection. It is time for him to retire.
2,"An amazing prof who has heard and seen it all and will let you have it if he suspects you of BSing or laziness. Those who accuse him of being ""mean"" missed his point completely. His relentless prodding is the effort of a man who genuinely cares about his students. Don't listen to the bitter students who couldn't take the heat"
3,I had this teacher in 2000 and he was an AWESOME teacher  scary but in the end he made me THINK about what I'm reading like I never have before and that is what got me through college! He is a real teacher that expects you to learn!
3.5,By far the best teacher I have ever had. Without a doubt. He has taught me more in 2 courses than the rest of my college experience combined. The people who give him a bad rap never invested enough in their learning to understand him in the first place. The only teacher who won't waste your time  but he expects that you want to learn.
1.5,Very difficult class. Robert Coleman enjoys putting students on the spotlight and will keep pressuring you to speak even when you have no idea what to say. Try to speak as little as possible in the class. Do NOT raise your hand. You have to read about 100 pages of online or textbook material for each class or else he WILL put you on the spot.
1.5,Coleman is fascinating to listen to  but unfortunately he is EXTREMELY unclear about assignments. He is not useful when you ask for clarification on assignments  and just expects you to know what he means on his obtuse questions. Very intelligent man  but needs to learn how to support students as much as he challenges them.
1.5,Coleman is challenging. Students basically argue for a whole 2.40 hours. Other will say that he is not worth putting up with. He does come off as belittling  so if you are up for a challenge  take this class. If not  avoid it because you will be put on the spot. Other than that  he has a lot to say and numerous interesting  heart wrenching stories.
5,Difficult  but totally awesome. Worth the work!
1,Bob Coleman is not a teacher. He gets off to embarrassing his students. If you take this class don't raise your hand because if your wrong he will belittle you. He will spew useless amounts of random knowledge to make you think he is a genius. A teacher is meant to guide his students not destroy them.
1,Coleman is a hugely influential teacher and is very knowledgeable  but he is very unclear about his assignments. His final for this class was horrible and he still hasn't given back ONE grade from the beginning of the semester. He is intimidating and nothing you say is ever good enough.
4,There is no doubt in my mind that Coleman was the most influential professor I ever had. I was a student of his 12 yrs ago & I'm still in awe of the learning experience I had in his courses. Anyone afraid of hard work  thinking critically  or extremely needy should probably forget about this dynamic prof.
3.5,Look past his bully act and you'll find someone who's remarkably intelligent and genuinely caring. Think rationally  keep your emotions in check  open your mind and put serious thought into the things that Bob says and you will benefit tremendously from him. Only those who put true and honest effort into their studies succeed with Bob.
2.5,Coleman expects to much from his students.If you are a full time student I do not suggest taking any of his classes.I was not expecting an easy A from his class  I do not expect any English class to be easy. I spoke with him multiple times during his office hours
4.5,While Bob Coleman's class was undoubtedly one of the most difficult I have taken  with high expectations and a large workload  I can honestly say it was one of the best classes I've taken at SSU. I am more proud of the work I did in this class than in any other. Bob also puts an incredible amount of work and effort into his classes.
5,John Burk is a great professor! I failed Business Calc the first time but after taking him I actually started understanding. He gives a good bit of homework but it all helps for the exams that he gives.
5,Very comfortable pace for a Calc class. He goes over several examples for each topic and leaves time at the end of class for questions. Very easy to reach to meet during office hours. If you're trying to get into the school of business but struggle with Calc  he's the perfect teacher.
5,Best math teacher I've ever had. Had to drop calculus twice before taking his class  but got a B with him.
5,Best professor of all time.
5,Hands down best math teacher I've ever had. If you ever have any questions  GO TO OFFICE HOURS. I went almost every week with homework questions and he was so so so helpful. His tests and homework are fair. He drops your lowest quiz as well. He is a very clear and organized lecturer  and is extremely approachable and helpful. Sweet sweet guy.
5,Professor Burk is awesome! Best math teacher I have ever had. He truly cares about his students and goes to great lengths to make sure that everyone understands the material.
5,seriously in love with this man..he is so helpful and caring. best professor I've ever had. I highly recommend him.
5,Great guy who cares about his students. He will do anything to help you and is very approachable.
5,He's the best <3
5,Professor Burk is THE nicest guy ever! He genuinely cares about how you are doing in his class  and he will go out of his way to help you understand concepts if you need the extra help. He also will even stop during class to check and see if anyone needs clarification. Take him if you get the chance!!
5,Professor Burk is the best mathematics professor you will ever have. EXTREMELY helpful and really cares about his students. Very fair quizzes and exams. Gives a lot of homework  but it helps with factoring in your final grade.
5,Everything said is true  he is completely fantastic. The best I've had. He cares about his students and wants you to do well. He is very straightforward and understandable but even if you struggle he will help. Its not a blowoff and he takes attendance  but going to class and doing all the work helps alot. Most test questions from the book/reviews.
5,Prof Burk is literally the best professor. I hate math and he made the class bearable. Moreover  he is always willing to help and always responds to email. 100% recommend him for Business Calc!!
5,Professor Burk is the best math teacher i've ever had. He loves what he does and makes sure everyone understands what he is teaching. He is always willing to help and is truly such a nice guy.I would recommend taking his business calculus class! I got an A. If you do all the homework  and study for quizzes and tests you're set for an A!
5,Professor Burk is really a great  cheerful guy! He wants all of his students to succeed and is willing to do whatever he can to help each and every student get a good grade. He explains everything well and has very helpful office hours. One of my favorite instructors at Pitt!
5,Best professor ever. Genuinely a nice guy who just wants everyone to do well. Tests are nearly identical to the review problems he assigns. Always willing to clarify concepts in lecture and holds plenty of office hours.
5,One of the best math professors someone could hope for. I had him for Bus Calc  and he was wonderful. He was always available to help  even outside of his official office hours. He really appreciates if you show that you're trying. Some of his test questions straight from the review and homework  so as long as you understand those  you'll be fine.
5,I had him for business calc and he made everything easy to understand. If you go to class and pay attention there is no way you can fail. He is very nice  cares about his students  and approachable.
4.5,Do I really need to say anything? Just look at the other comments. Great guy.
4.5,such a nice guy. i didn't do anything in the class and ended up with a b. it's not hard to do well and even if you screw up the tests  if you study for the final and do well on it you'll get a good grade. much better than beverly mitchell (from what i hear)
5,Professor Thompson was a great section leader. She was able to control the direction of the class with leaders dialogue
2.5,The reasding list was juicy-looking  but by the end it was apparent that the class lacked structure and rationale. Thompson's lectures were not always on the mark  and it seemed like her TAs (who also gave lectures) were more clued in...
5,HE IS A GREAT PERSON WITH SO KIND HEART. I AM SO THANKFUL THAT I MET A PERSON LIKE CHEF HERSEY AND GOT A LOT OF THINGS TO LEARN.
5,Great Chef and great teacher. Loved my two years here at fanshawe.
5,Great teacher. Alot of experience in the industry and it shows in his teaching methods. Anytime you need help he is willing to give you his time.
5,Best teacher ever
4.5,No Comments
1.5,dry  no experience  weak food.
2.5,the note Nazi - could we have a little more information presented in a dry and boring way
5,was the absolute greatest math teacher ive ever had. She was a sexy woman and could make a 3hr math class very entertaining. I am absolutely crushed she is retired.
5,She is an incredible math teacher and an incredible person! She cares about each and every one of her students and she will help you as much as you need it  she is fast at responding to emails and she is funny too. One of the most wonderful and the most memorable professors Ive ever had.
5,She is absolutely the best math teacher i've ever had. I have always struggled with math. And with her help i passed the class.
4.5,Not a fan of math myself but she explains things in a helpful way.
3,TOTALLY OUT THERE SHES FUNNY SHE SHE WILL CALL YOU STINKY AND RAMBLE IN BUT SHES GREAT
5,she is the best math professor ever!!!If you need to take math take her and you would be fine...
5,She was a very helpful teacher and anyone who wants to pass and graduate  obviously has to do the work  so why not take her and enjoy it! Give her a break  she's a math teacher! How easy is it to teach math and still maintain the student's attention? Not easy but she does it well.
5,She makes math so fun and interesting...She go's out of her way to make you understand. she is a wonderful professor take her and you will be fine...If you don't take her you will be a dum ass...
1,Sarcastic on the verge of being mean. A little too cocky for my taste...couldn't concentrate on the lesson without worrying what she was going to say next!
3,overrated  pretty full of herself.
5,Had to take College Algebra  havent had any Algebra in 7 years. She makes it interesting and understandable. She is very helpful  takes time out in class to check your work  overall a wonderful professor. She even gives you partial credit on the tests for your work  very fair with grading... just dont miss class or you WILL get lost!
5,Made math very interesting.Make sure you keep up with homework and ask questions if you don't understand.Fun class.Looked forward to this class.If you need a math class try to take her.
5,the best damn teacher ever!!!She makes algebra so understandable!!
5,Awesome teacher!
5,She's a good teacher. I know most of the stuff we are doing already  but she keeps it interesting.
5,No Comments
5,Amazing teacher  makes you learn whether you realize it or not  and very easy on the eyes. Take every and any math class you can with this woman!
5,I had her for two semester. She really takes the time out to help you with your work. She is the best math teacher I ever had. She is very funny and always talks about her kids. SHe's a great professor.
5,Awesome teacher. She made algebra bearable.
4.5,She loves to teach.Great teaching method and care about her students a lot. She was born to be a great teacher and I'm happy that I've taken her class once...you won't regret it :)
5,Speech is a very scary course for many people. I did very well in this class with her support. She is witty and helpful. I especially appreciated how she helped students with fear  who were shy or English Language Learners build their confidence. I wish she taught more classes.
5,One of the best teachers at NCC. Professor Solon is one of those teachers who touches your life. I learned so much in this class. It also gave me the courage to take more art classes even though I am not an art student. She isn't difficult as long as you show your trying in the class. She always offers help to her students.
5,Best teacher ever. You wanna A. take her for anything
5,I really liked her teaching style. Compared to the other speech teachers she is very good.
2,One of the most fake people I have ever known. Snotty and condescending in almost every comment she makes to students. Not in touch with people she's trying to teach at all. Not very understanding of even extenuating circumstances.
5,He is definitely one of the best electronics instructors I've ever studied under. Very knowledgeable in the subject. His explanations are clear. As long as you do the homework and required labs  you should get an A or a B. The only bad thing about the class is the schedule. 6:30PM to 9:15 PM. Sometimes he lets us leave a little bit early.
3,Fun and knowledgable person. Taught the easiest ways to do Binary numbers and made circuit schematics look like cake while others won't know squat. The only downside is the time of the class and he makes you stay up til 9:45 in the evening.
5,He is very good. This was my first electronics course and he made the material very clear and easy to understand and the material itself is not easy at all but he manage to make it understanable. Just don't wait until the end to do the HW or you are going to be sorry. Take very good notes and ask?.
5,No Comments
4,Tim's a cool professor who cares about his students  -sometimes really hard to reach outside of class. Lectures felt very long sometimes because he tends to talk a lot sometimes  but makes them more interesting with visual aids. There's a lot of reading that we did  but he breaks it up so if you keep up you'll be fine! Looking forward to part 2/2.
5,Tim is a very hands on professor and loves it when you ask him questions on scientific ideas or topics in the world. I had him for my FLC and I would take any class as him as the professor! The only thing is you have to read to books he assigns and watch the movies too!
4,This SFI class was definitely my favorite course from my first year at SSU. Tim offers really interesting and inspiring points of view  gives really awesome lectures  and is working for the good of his students. The class depends on the books  films and short stories  but its for sure fun and interesting if you put your mind and heart into it
2,"He's ridiculously vague and biased. There is no point in arguing with him. If you disagree with him  you're wrong. He started off his first class with the statement ""I'm more liberal than Hillary Clinton."" No relevance to the course  but an accurate start to this class that is better off being called ""An Hour and Fifty Minutes of Tim's Opinions"
5,Show up and pass  easy grader  be sure to review powerpoint slides before tests and you will pass.
3,Tim is a really nice man and is very knowledgeable about his subject  but as a teacher  he is often inconsistent and frustrating. A lot of reading and busy work.
2,Wandling is extrememly confusing and frustrating. He doesn't use a powerpoint for most of his lectures which makes it difficult to understand what exactly you need to know for the exams. You get your grades through the TA's  not him. There is a lot of reading for each class  and is difficult to understand at the beginning of the semester.
3,Tim is a great guy and loves what he does. I had him for FYE and he has different dynamics from the other teachers. He was never very clear on any assignment but loves what he does and always wants to keep on track in class. Easy
3.5,Pretty funny guy. The class got off topic a LOT. Always willing to meet w/ students during office hours to clarify any misunderstandings. I missed more than a few classes & it had no affect on my grade. Old  tries to be funny  VERY nice & understanding guy. Excepted my late work. TAKE HIS CLASS. Easy A.
4,Tim is a nice guy and loves to help if asked  he will assign a lot of reading if you can stay on top of that you should do fine. He allows rewrites  & probably one the few teachers who is easy and at the same time brings out your best writing skills. he is also quite interesting and brings so many ideas to discuss  likes to incorporate Film & music
4,Awesome teacher. If you want a class that is going to push you to be a better writer  take Tim. One of the most friendliest  down to earth teachers I've ever had. He's big on questioning things  civil disobedience  and service learning. Never be afraid of him  he will give you all the time you need if you come to him during his freetime
3,Very reading intensive. Tim's an easy grader  lots of quizzes and three major papers. Attendance is part of your grade. We read a novel a week  which makes it easy to fall behind. At least the books are interesting.
2,Tim is very passionate about whatever class he is teaching  but if you are not diggin' the class then it gets annoying and old fast. Pretty easy grader  quizzes every week  three paper and a final. Way too much reading at way too fast of a pace.
5,Tim is amazing. He is always there if you have questions. He is a prof that truly has the best interest of his students in mind. His class was always interesting and insightful.
3,GREAT! If you are the type of person that likes your work back right away  stay away from Tim. He does a great job making the class interesting  but is not very good at keeping the class on topic. You have to be willing to read all the required material and also go see him in his office if you need help. I suggest this class!!!
2,Nice guy  not very helpful.
4,he's super relaxed about deadlines and he's not a control freak like most professors. he reminds me of my dad.
1,Not a good teacher. He definitely tried though.
1,What should have been an interesting an informative class was simply awful. We rarely discussed the required reading and the concepts we were supposed to be learning weren't brought up  let alone explained. I came away from this class hating theory with a passion.
5,These classes are from before the department switched to 4 unit courses. Tim was tough at times  but really worked with students to ensure that they did well and understood course material.
5,She is probably one of the best teachers I have ever had. Makes it fun. She is hilarious and good at teaching. She can make it interesting and gives easy tests. She is helpful and very nice. Couldnt ask for a better teacher. Youll be lucky if you take one of her classes.
5,Wonderful  wonderful!! Highly recommened  I'm taking her Marketing class I liked her so much! Good notes  good tests  and funny to boot!
5,make sure to do the story ideas. Do your beats as well. Buy the required book  most of the coursework is AP style. He cancels class to give students more time to work on the assignments.
5,If you don't like Fred or any of his classes then there is clearly something wrong with you. This is the second time I've had him for a class and I have no complaints. Just do the work and you will get an easy A. Make sure you talk to him amount your assignments  ask him about anything so he will know you truly care  and be part of the East Texan.
5,Very easy class. Makes it very interesting. Only 2 assignments. No book. 5 quizzes I think but are super easy. Don't really even have to come to pass.
2,Overall this class is pretty easy. His syllabus has most of the words that will be on the quiz and final is optional. He assigns two papers at most throughout the whole semester. Don't even try to email him- he won't reply. One thing I didn't like was that you don't know what your grade is until the last few weeks (no e-college)
5,Fred Stewart is one of best professors I've ever had! His class lectures are always interesting and keeps your attention. Class has 2 easy writing assignments and 4 tests that are easy because they cover vocabulary. Definitely an easy A if you put in a little effort. Don't have to take the final if your grade is high enough. Would take him again!
5,The class was worth attending  so many cool examples that won't be found anywhere else. No textbook  no problem. Two writing assignments are straightforward four quizzes are easy if you take notes and study vocab. Do well and you can accept your grade without worrying about a final exam.
3.5,Very nice professor who is always clear on his material. Study the syllabus and take good notes and you'll pass the tests  but there's only 4. Can be an easy A if you put some effort in. Can be an easy F if you never show up or study for the tests.
5,This class is no doubt an easy A. You pay attention and do good on the tests your good.
5,Cool class - Very Interesting. Take notes on all of the * items in lecture and study the syllabus handout and you WILL make an A. He is a great professor - you will really like this class. Did I mention - NO BOOK!!!!! YEAH- Save some money
5,great teacher  laid back  helpful and really funny. hes a no bs kinda teacher and will give you extra time if you need it.
5,Fred is the best! I have to disagree with whoever said he doesn't give stuff back  because I have gotten everything back very quickly in both of the classes I have him for! He is very laid back and is always willing to help if you ask! Easy A's for sure!
1,you never get anything back from Fred so you have no clue if you are doing good or not and he cancels calss more and more as the semester goes on
5,If you come to class  take notes on the '*' items  and spend maybe 15 minutes looking over your notes and study guide before the test you WILL make a A. This class is a must take uni. studies course and a great GPA booster :)
1,Going to this class is a joke - just stay at home and write articles all the time. Also - you have to write more than what is just on the syllabus b/c that alone won't get you an A. Stewart is a great guy  but you won't learn anything about reporting in the class you just have to write on your own
5,"Fred is the man. take the notes ever thing that he covers on the screen in * will be on his test. His the best guy that teaches listen and you can get that ""A"" due those assignments its only 3 you have a month on each. WELL RECOMMEDED."
5,If you go to class and do the EASY assignments  this is an EASY A. Not a hard class. Tests are easy. Strongly recommend!
4.5,Too easy for my liking - I suppose this is why our Journalism department is so laughable. But whom am I to complain - it is free credits. If you are looking for pure and instant blowoff  congrats! You have it.
5,is this even a college class? i could have made an 'A' when i was 10...very easy class...a must to take!
5,Take Jour 114 for one of your University Studies courses! It is a fun  easy class  and Mr. Stewart is awesome!
5,Mr. Stewart is so awesome! He's one of the best professors I've ever taken. He cares  he helps  and he's very interested in his students well-being. He's also fun on TIPA trips!!
4,O-Chem 2 is a difficult class. . Dr.G Focuses more on the mechanism of the reactions and few problems here and there. Although this may not be efficient for most students  he really wants you to succeed. He makes it possible to earn 100% on at least one of the 4 exams -we got lucky for 2 (this is huge!!). He wants you to try- you slack

He wants to do you to try- you slack
1,I regretted taken class with him. He is just horrible. It is very hard to apply what he taught in class on exams. He's not a fair grader. Coming to his class does not worth with bcos you can not apply what he teaches in class on exams and home work. I will never advise anyone to take his class. He will mess up your gpa. His labs grading are worst.
5,Dr. G has gotten HOT over the years! And the clicking of the pen is even HOTTER! He's great  you won't regret it! Good luck!
1,Dr. Gallaher is an unfair grader. He will not follow his grading key  he will not return assignments from your first semester until your second semester so if you end up with a C you will have no idea why. He also has made students feel stupid when they ask him question and has had to apologize it.
2.5,If you can get to him on a good day he can be kind and helpful  but on a bad day he is rather condescending and makes you feel like a complete idiot. He makes really weird and boarding on inappropriate jokes. His tests are really tough and there is never enough time for examples in class. He is also a very slow grader when it comes to lab reports.
4,Gallaher is an awesome professor. The course content is not easy  but he makes it bearable. He is very funny and cracks jokes frequently. I really respect him as a professor. While you the grading is not the quickest  he provides very individualized feedback and it makes the wait worth it. If you need help outside of his course he will provide it.
4,He teaches organic chemistry. It is kind of hard to make organic appealing  but he finds a way. He has a funny sense of humor. The class is hard  but it is due to the subject material itself. He is always there if you need help. His tests are extremely difficult  but he tries to be as helpful as possible. One of the nicest professor at Carlow.
5,He's s great professor who genuinely cares about his students. He talks to people who talk to him so that can sometimes be misconstrued as favoritism. He teaches organic  a difficult subject very well. He's real and does not beat around the bush  which is nice.
3,First off  he is definitely NOT hot. EW!!! Secondly  he is a decent teacher  but he picks favorites and makes it blatantly obvious who those individuals are. His criticisms on labs/exams are harsh  rude  and not helpful. In one word: arrogant.
3,He is very helpful in class  but he will grade your labs very strict  & he will also leave rude comments on everything he grades
5,He is the BEST!!!!
4.5,He wants people to learn but it can be difficult to learn what to do.
4,He is very smart and knows what he is talking about! O-chem was something I knew nothing about  but I left loving it! His only downside is that he chooses favorites and is very arrogant. He was also very unorganized in handing back test/assmts/labs. If you can deal with that it is very worth your time to take his course.
5,He is an amazing professor with great people skills. If you are confused about anything he can clear it up for you within 15 minutes of his office hours. Take him if you are a chem major it will also help in the long run he is full of very informative advice.
5,No Comments
5,He is a GREAT instructor. I suck at the class though and it is mad hard and sometimes makes me want to kill myself  and everytime there is a test I get sick  I think it is because of the ulcer I got from being stressed  but I am getting through it and getting the extra help I need.
4.5,Wonderful man...too bad he's getting married!
5,Yes  his class is hard  but he teaches the material VERY well. It is a difficult course to keep up with...but if you don't slack off too much and ask for help when you need it  you'll be fine.
4,Hard as hell  but I learned a lot.
3.5,She doesn't really teach  it's mostly watching movies on the chapters  and the movies are boring. She grades really easily & the assignments are easy.
2,Horrible. Zero effort in teaching the class. Stupid movie after stupid movie.
1,There are a total of 5 grades. She grades easy because she doesn't care. The tests are 20 true or false. If you want an easy A take this class. If not- you won't learn anything of importance in this class.
3.5,this class was pretty fun  and she graded so easily. really nice professor  by the way.
2.5,No Comments
2.5,this is the biggest farce of a class that i have ever seen. and how can it even be considered a class if it's always cancelled? nice prof. but not a good one.
5,He's an awesome professor! If you pay attention and copy all his class notes  you can easily get an A in his class. We had a quiz every Friday (about 3-5 questions) and 4 tests in total. He does assign homework  but it's just so you can get extra practice and he doesn't even grade it. I will definitely take him again!
1,"The worst class I have ever taken. Attend tutoring twice a week in addition to seeking outside help. Very condescending. After asking to go over a homework question during the allotted time he responded by saying ""I can't believe you asked to go over that"". Overall rude and not helpful at all."
1,His exams are way harder than his quizzes and the homework he assigns. I got A's and B's on all his quizzes. I went to tutoring 3x a week and to peer study sessions once a week. I went to him for help and was told that he doesn't expect much from his students and he doesn't understand why I'm struggling. I attended every lecture.
2,This was the hardest most stressful class I have ever had.
2,i took CC102 with Mr. Peters. Honestly  the only reason why I passed is because the class is basically common sense. He is knowledgeable and excited about the subject  but he talks more than teaches. His notes don't always align with the book. His logic & grading is confusing . He talks fast and lacks enough patience to teach a class. Avoid him.
3,I thought I would be taking PreCalclus but apparently I am taking middle school math. I am not in any way prepared to move onto Calculus I next semester. We spent more than half of this semester completing basic review and he even commented in class that we have spent three times the amount of time on review than the book recommended.
2.5,Extremely picky grader. He takes points off for lack of punctuation on math problems. He is easily agitated and has no problem talking down to people and making nasty or passive-aggressive remarks. The worst part is that the material he teaches leaves you completely unprepared for the courses you need to take after. Avoid him.
1,Horrible teacher. He was confusing and boring. He graded weird. Really was not considerate if you did not understand. DONT TAKE HIM!!!
4.5,doctor peters is a fabulous math teacher  although he is a ridiculously picky grader!! as long as you follow his format on the board and make sure to copy it directly in your notes so that you can mimick it for tests/quizzes  you should be okay!! he's funny  too.
5,I thought this class was easy but I am amazing at Math  but even if you aren't good at math he makes sure that everyone understands what's going on.
4.5,He can come off a bit arrogant but he is always willing to go the extra mile and help you. As long as you're respectful he'll work with you.
1,THE WORST PROFESSOR I'VE EVER HAD.I WENT INTO HIS CLASS EXPECTING A LOT BECAUSE OTHER STUDENTS RAVED ABOUT HIM. WHAT A MISTAKE...HE'S ARROGANT AND NAPOLEANIC.
3,Tests are pretty easy but he can be stingy with points. He so boring though.
4.5,Intelligent  organized  has a contageous enthusiasm. Somehow makes difficult or boring concepts approachable & interesting. Will review concepts right before quizzes when students are confused. Straightforward testing  but a bit of a stickler on writing/proofs. Student-friendly grading points system.
4,Made Statistics easy and understandable. If you are not math literate I would suggest you take him.
5,Dr. Peters is a fabulous professor. Anyone that can make calculus understandable deserves a gold star. He has a lot of enthusiam for the subject matter. He is a very nice person and always willing to help if needed. Clearly  this is a very intelligent man. I love Dr. Peters!!!
5,Mr. Peters is a good guy. He is really enthusiastic about Quanitative Reasoning and gives really good (and as many as you need) examples. I was never good at any math and i dreaded taking this course(esp at 8am). But I'm telling you... take Mr. Peters if you aren't a math person  it will make your semester easier.

3,Dr. Peters is a nice guy and his classes are pretty easy... I didn't learn much but each class was a new adventure.
4.5,ken was the best math teacher i have ever had. he makes math so much easier and makes learning fun! thanks ken!
5,JJ made you work hard but she was so knowledgeable  I learned a lot. She cared about whether her students were doing well. Even though she seemed strict and tough to talk with  she was pretty easy to talk to once you initiated it. And she would bring scones for AM classes and snacks and tea for PM classes!

5,I love JJ!!!! I took her for every class that I could. She was like a grandmother. She brought tea and snacks to class and allowed you to really be able to sit back and enjoy English and Literature without having to stress out about your next paper
5,One of the greatest teachers at SSU - extrememly knowledgeable and pushed students to their potential. Also quirky and fun  she'd bring juice and scones to AM classes and tea and cookies to PM classes!
3.5,Lots of writing  but a nice lady who loves teaching and is definitely spunky
4,she seemed really laid back in class but if you visited her in her office she made you feel stupid and inept. encouraged passion in her class  had some spunk.

5,I dreaded speech class and Laura made it fun. As long as you follow her grade sheet  which is very clearly laid out on what she wants  you'll get an A. You do need to KNOW your speech. She's a wonderful teacher  I miss her class even though speech is my number one fear!
4.5,Took this as an 8 week class. Two chapters a week and two quizzes a week. Pretty straight forward  and you do have to do the reading if you want to do well on the the written portions of the quizzes. There is one long paper that's do by the end of the class  and I suggest you do not procrastinate on it like I did. It takes a long time.
4,She is a very friendly and enthusiastic teacher. Really easy class
4.5,Took this online as an 8 weeker. Relatively easy class  keep up with the work and you will be fine. Teacher seemed nice VIA emails  had no other contact with her. Final project takes a while so get started early. Interesting course  I enjoyed it.
5,Great teacher who definitely does not get enough credit for er efforts to teach students.
1,Treats students more like friends than pupils. I needed a teacher and not a friend. At times hard to follow. Take with caution.
1,A giant critic. Teaches the class as if she is constantly getting high on her powers to critique and judge  rather than teaching the students to learn  she teaches the students to memorize and judges based on how well the instructions are memorized. May be describe as cool  but as far as a teacher goes  i wouldn't recommend.
5,Everybody HAS to take speech (aarggh!) Thankfully  I got a great teacher. She was very encouraging and got the class to encourage each other.You've gotta do the work  but she helps you and always keeps on top of reminding you when stuff's due  which helps. I'm a bit scatterbrained sometimes!
5,Took an online speech class with her. Need to read the whole book! But the material was easy to read  she is readily available for questions. Awesome teacher!
5,"This teacher rocks. I had ZERO interest in going to this class but I learned much with her ""stage material"" outlines. She is very supportive of everyone and tries to get you to be a good speaker. One of the best teachers I have had and I would take this class again in a second. I have used her outlines for other classes for presentations."
4.5,I took this class over the summer cuz I heard you have to do less speeches and you do  only 3. I was so scared going into it  but it really wasnt that bad. Like I said  3 speeches and 2 tests right out of the book. She can be pretty harsh but she still gives you a good grade as long as you have the written wrok done how she wants it. Easy class!
3.5,cool teacher  funny  and you may actually learn something in her class if you play attention and participate. I haven't got a grade from her yet so my fingers are still crossed.
1.5,I had her for class and at first she was cool but then I had to miss class for health reasons and she went bullistic! I would not suggest her unless you think u can turn in EVERY assignment be on time to EVERY class and never EVER miss a class
3,She is very fun teacher !!!! Can be a little tough but nothing we can't deal with. Speaches are not too hard. Good advice- choose the topicks you care about otherwise she gets upset!!! I would recommend to take her class! She also lets you out of the classroom earlier !!!!
2.5,Speech assigments are pretty basic  however  I do not like being graded in front of 20 other students. I would prefer a basic Thank you  and sit down. She goes on and on about all of the negative things about the speech. She was more interested in theatre then speech. Don't take this class unless you have thick skin!
1,she is an egomaniac and she is crazy. unclear  never holds office hours  never seems to know where she is going when she teaches. i suggest avoiding her
4,She's a very nice teacher and I have a lot of the same views on life and the fine arts as she does. She may be really tough at times  but it's only because she wants to make you the best you possibly can be.

1,She is really self-centered. Doesn't care about her students at all and talks negitively about them in class. She gives bad grades to people who do the work and work hard and others who don't care about the class she gives them excellent grades. DON'T TAKE HER. YOU'LL BE MAKING THE BIGGEST MISTAKE.
3,His lectures are boring and just talk. Does hand out notes. His test are amazing  not easy  but well made. You can reason out questions and he will accept them if your reasoning is sound. Not a my way or the high way teacher  as long as you prove your answer. Learn the fundamentals of physics by heart and you will pass his class.
1,Expect very poor comprehension in this course. Grading is very rough.
1,"HIS NOTES DON""T HELP YOU ON EXAMS"
1,He's kinda rude if you ask him for help and not sympathetic at all.
1,Took this class in summer. I cannot recommend anyone to submit themselves to the hellish confusion and utter futility that pervade this professor's classroom.
1.5,The good  he gives you the notes and the sample problems. The bad is that the lectures are dull and less exciting than just reading the book. He has a particular way that you have to work problems on test  but does not use that method when showing problems. All of your points lost will be format errors. Not cause you didn't understand the subject.
1,Hard to stay awake and pay attention. Too much material to go through to prepare for tests. Would not take him again. Unless you absolutely have to  or if this is the only class you're taking  don't take him. :(
1,Our class signed a petition against the way he teaches to give to the school board. It was a challenge to pay attention for more than 2 minutes. I had to repeat my question to him 6 times once until I was almost screaming.
1.5,"I found myself more worried about following ""his way"" then actually learning the material. The problems that he works out on the board would be counted wrong in his exams. He avoids doing problems his way because its a waste of time  but yet still expects you to do it his way. The class is fine  just chose a different instructor."
1,OMG there was 28 of us to start and its 4 weeks into the semester and theres only 10 of us left!!! Lets see how many will be left at the end of sem. My bet is 4
1,"So many problems: 1)doesnt know how to ""teach"". 2) Cant hear the student asking questions. 3) Takes whole class to do 1 problem. 4) FORCES us to solve the LONG and HARD way. If not done like how he done it  minus 10. I took Phys soph High school and i have 3.6 GPA  so no im not stupid. His class is just horrible. ACC needs to fire him  IMMEDIATELY."
1,Prepare to do a lot of outside study to learn anything in this class. All lectures are just PowerPoint slides and frequently have mistakes in them. He takes off points on HW & tests for things like not showing work on basic math and not using the exact format he uses on formulas. He also has a hard time understanding any questions people ask.
1,Take this class to fail.
2.5,The professor teaches in a boring approach. Its all powerpoints. He wants your work to be done EXACTLY how he does it. I like physics  but im not learning despite the hours spent studying. There are only 10 students left in class. He gives out a lot of handouts  which he revises constantly. I do not advice anyone to take him.
1.5,Homework may be 20 problems you miss 1/2 of one question & lose 15 points.Not even wrong  just don't show your work or work a different way than what was shown.Spends the class doing 1-2 problems  only to almost finish someone from the class tells him what he did wrong and he starts over.More than 1/2 the class dropped before the 1st test.
1,I am a junior from TSU  and he is beyond a doubt the worst prof I have ever had(or heard of).he thinks that he must teach at the MIT level  takes his responsibility way to seriously and truely just doesnt know how to explain the subject. I mistakingly thought I could just teach my self and go to the tutoring labs but you have to be a master to pass
3.5,The class was fine. You are allowed to take notes into the exams. So long as you put in the hours to prepare there is no problem.
1,the worst teacher I have every had. I took him for engineering physic. Spends to much time going over the note that he did not even write himself and do no help. Does not explain himself well. His test are super hard  no one got higher then 85. There were 28 students when the semester started and only 3 people were left when the semester ended
1,dont take him
2,"It would take him the whole class time to work one problem! I've seen him ""target"" the folks that may ""seem"" trouble makers. He grabbed this girl by the arm and took her outside. He thought she was being disrubtive  but she was asking her neighbor a question.One a good note he will let you make up his labs and sometimes get away w/late Homework."
3,He's a great guy~I can't really blame him for doing so poorly on the final exam. I agree with the previous comment  you really need to know your stuff for the midterm & exams as he does not tell you anything at all. He's still one of the better one's I've had  very energetic lectures making soil seem somewhat interesting. GoodLuck if you have him
3.5,timmer is very nice  and seems to know a lot  although his lectures didn't contain much actual information. one reservation i had  though  was that he gave us a practise test for the final  and it couldn't have been any more different from the actual final. why even bother?
3,I dropped this class. Timmer isn't a terrible professor and he's a nice passionate guy but his expectations are unclear. If you take one of his classes  know EVERYTHING from the textbook  even if he says otherwise. His test questions are very specific.
5,Great teacher. Very clear and super intelligent. Kind and cute. I learned a lot.
5,Awesome teacher! NO textbook  no written assignments  no tests. 4 speeches  3 outlines and you r done. Take him for your speech classes!
5,Easy grader but make sure if he says 2 full pages that it is 2 FULL pages. You must see 2 plays during the semester and write a small review. Lots of notes like 10 pages a class period. He gives study guides and doesn't take attendance. great teacher
5,Very passionaite and understanding teacher! Extemely fair!
5,He is an awesome teacher! NO homework except for outlines and outside reports. He doesn't teach you stuff u don't need to know. You get out of class early a lot of times to prepare for speeches. He is very helpful in explaining how to become a better speaker!
5,Great guy knows what hes talking about  easy going Easy A if you come to class (BUT NEEDS TO LOSE BEATNIK STYLE)
4,Sometimes he wasn't very understanding of certain situations  but as a teacher he was awesome. Very clear and very supportive.
4,Very cool guy. He's really easy going and doesn't teach you stuff you don't need to know for the class.

5,Craig is such an awesome teacher. The content isnt easy to begin with but he makes it better! He cares 150% about his students that is for sure. Kind of nerdy but in the best way - take him you wont regret it!!!
5,Zoology was the best course I've taken so far across 3 different colleges. It wasn't difficult to pass at all  was extremely interesting & the classroom is loaded with specimens. Craig is an amazing professor and just a pleasant person to be around in general. Dress for the weather  as you should be prepared for outdoor excursions at any time!
5,I love Craig! His zoology class was really interesting and he's so adorable in a sweet nerdy way. Honestly he's my favorite teacher I've ever had! I just love his personality  however  His class was extremely hard for me. I ended up getting a C and they was a miracle. The tests where you had to identify species by their scientific names were horrid
5,Professor Stettner has a wide variety of knowledge about species from fish  plants  animals  etc. He takes the time to explain important concepts and is approachable by office hours or email if you have issues. If you are not the best at science or not a good student  there is more than enough extra credit to keep your grade in good standing.
4,Craig is amazing. At first you'll find him quirky and different but he grows on you. I made the mistake of missing lecture a lot and that really affected my grade because EACH lecture he grades and gives points for participation. He does offer A LOT of extra credit and his discussions are outdoor and super hands on. We did a lot  good experience
5,I loved Craig's class. He's such a nice teacher and you can really learn a lot if you pay attention. Plus the outdoor days where great!
5,Craig is my absolute favorite teacher of all time  I have taken zoology and man & environment with him and I am going on his field bio class to Costa Rica this winter. Zoology means a lot of memorizing but he gives a ton of extra credit on the tests and in the class in general so it is easy to do well. Man & environment was the easiest class ever.
5,Hands down my favorite Biology professor! Would recommend!!! You get a lot of extra credit and its just an overall fun class. You go outside for most of your labs. Craig is so understanding!!! Everyone loves the guy!
5,Craig really is awesome  he gives a ton of extra credit and really does care about what he teaches. It is seriously impossible to fail the class if you show up and do some extra credit. 100% take this man's class if you can  he really is awesome. I am taking one of his classes again next semester.
5,Awsome guy. Very smart and passionate about the world. GIVES A TON OF EXTRA CREDIT. Impossible to fail with all the extra credit.
5,Craig is AMAZING!!! He's a really cool guy and knows what he's talking about. There are 4 tests total  which are hard  but he gives over 100pts extra credit so it's like one bad test didn't happen. It's Man & ENVIRONMENT so you do go out almost everyday but I loved it. It was so fun and interactive. Great teacher who's passionate and cares
5,I took this class during the summer  we went outside almost every single day to walk along the lake  in the woods & sometimes to do some very messy &gross activities. Going to class & outside earns you participation pts. He is not very good at conveying material in class so you NEED to read the book to do well on exams. There is LOTS of memorizing.
5,Craig is an awesome teacher! You can really tell he is passionate about what he teaches. Also the class is a bit hard (10+ exams) but there is so much extra credit you can still pass with a good grade. You also do go outside a lot but it's a lot of fun! This was my Favorite class & professor and I wish I could take it again.
4,Absolutely in love with his job and studies. Very enthusiastic about the subject matter  and lots of opportunities to get hands on. Beware of skipping out on lab or classes though - tests often cover material that is not in the textbook. Does give tons of easy/free points in the way of in-class activities.
4,Me Stettnar is a really good teacher. His lectures are very understanding.
5,He comes off weird at first but you'll get used to it. He knows his stuff and he's truly so nice! He offers a lot of extra credit and chances to do them so he wants you to pass! You can do bad on the exam and still pass the class with a B with all the extra credit opportunity. He crams a lot of questions on the exams too!
5,Craig is an amazing teacher  probably my favorite and I do not like science classes. He's quirky and a little weird at first but you will love him by the end  he's hilarious. Do not take bio 103/104 if you do not like going outside because that is all you do. If you do like going outside  it's an easy A. No homework except to read. Study for tests.
4.5,Craig Stettner is awesome! I did not want to take a science class at all  but he definitely made it worth my while. He offers so much extra credit (over 100 points)! I got D's on tests  but still ended with an A in the class. Every lecture he gives you exercises which are nice grade boosters. Expect to go outside. Craig is really nice and helpful!
4,This class was so much fun. Expect to go outside ALOT. The tests are hard but he gives SO MUCH extra credit  it's impossible to fail. He's just a great guy and loves nature.
5,Professor Sterner is he best! he is the nicest man I have ever met. He truly cares about his students  and only wants them to do well. I would take his class again anyway  and i am not even smart in Science!! We go outside when its nice out and his extra credit projects are so much fun!!!
5,He is by far my favorite teacher at this school. He may seem cold at first but he is so caring and understanding with each student. As long as you put in the effort you can pass with an easy A.
5,This is a great class to take for people with no previous experience. He will help you get through every speech. Tests are so easy  as long as you put in effort and show up  youll be fine
5,One of the best professors I have ever had. He gives good feedback  has an upbeat personality  and will help you out with any difficulties. He makes his lectures interesting and puts you at ease when presenting a speech  which especially helps for the anxious. His study guides for tests are terrific  and I highly recommend him!
4,Communications majors this is the one to take! You will learn so much. He is highly skilled and really cares about making you a better speaker. Best instructor hands down.
4,Im TERRIFIED of public speaking and after this class i cannot say I am less so  but Mr.B is a caring prof who really wants you to do well! The comments saying to just try aren't wrong  he's an easy grader and I should have gotten a B cause of my exam scores but ended up with an A anyways? Also happened to a friend of mine. Just try and you'll pass.
3,He Has Us To A Lot Of Speeches & Quizzes. Bought 2 Books But Only Used One. Is An Okay Grader. Would Choose Someone Else...
4,I feel like I actually had to work for the A in this class for both the exams and the speech. So if you are taking a lot of classes and you want an easy A for speech  I suggest you take this class over the summer because you are required to work hard for the A. Also  you have to practice for the speech to get a good grade as well as read the book.
5,Very approachable professor. Understands that public speaking can be nervous to many  so he isn't harsh when he gives criticism. His grading is easy to understand. Overall  practice your speeches ahead of time so that you'll be in a good spot. There are a few exams as well  so you do have to read some chapters if you want to do well on those.
5,He makes you feel at ease and his grading method is clear and precise. He is also very approachable. I highly recommend him if you have never taken speech and super nervous about it.
5,Really good professor. He cares about his students and always wants them to improve. He knows everyone fears of public speaking but he makes the class a friendly environment. Tests are easy. Never opened the purple book. I used the white one to help me with our speech outlines. Very kind. You have 6 free absence passes. If you go over  you fail.
5,He generously grades speeches even if they are bad and understands public speaking is hard. He wants you to succeed and was my first professor in college to see good in me. The tests are easy as long as you read the book. I've learned so much in this class so if you take SPE101 be sure to take him!! Ask about extra credit I got 25 points added!
5,Took SPE at my home place. Almost passed but no luck. Had to repeat it at Harper thought the course would be a joke. Wow I was wrong! Professor B is the dude to take. Prof B is dope. He makes you learn how to speak publically and then you grow confidence and stuff. Lot of hands on in front of everyone. Be prepared. You will learn a ton from him!
5,Overall great teacher! Make sure to read the book and do the study guides before each test  the tests get harder and harder.
5,Mr. B is a very good speech professor. He understands most of his students hate public speaking but he just wants you to do your best. Some of his lectures are painfully boring but listening to someone talk about speaking tactics isn't fun anywhere. Show up for your speeches on time and you'll do fine!
5,Mr. Ballantyne is an amazing teacher. You are allowed to miss six classes without it effecting your grade. There are 4 to 5 speeches. As long as you keep improving and meet the required time you'll get an A or B. Just do not miss the day of your speech because you can NOT make it up  you will receive a zero. VERY kind and caring. Wants you to pass!
4.5,Mr. B is very enthusiastic about speech  he loves what he does and it shows. Hes very easy to talk to  and will give you feedback on his thoughts of your speech. He creates a comfortable environment in his classroom so when you go up to speak it isnt scary. You must show up to his class or you wont pass  he keeps track of attendance.
5,Great Professor! Really helped me out with every little detail of my speech and didn't seem to rest until we both knew it was the best I could do. Very great Professor and a very great man.
5,I have extreme anxiety when it come to talking in front of people and it wasn't easy but Mr. B is a very generous grader and just wants you to do your best. If someone with anxiety like me can pass this class with an A than anyone can. Take speech with Mr. B.
5,Mr. B. is the best speech professor anywhere. I HATE public speaking  but Mr. B. made us feel comfortable and laid back. He grades on improvement  not by expectation  meaning if you do poorly on one speech  but try harder and do better on the next one  he will take that improvement into account and boost your grade. He just wants to see you try :)
4,Professor Ballantyne was a great first speech teacher to have. Class was mostly lecture preparing you for speeches  then giving speeches  and there were 4 tests for the semester on lecture and the book. Since class was all lecture it was not fun  but is speech class fun? No. You have to show up  pay attention  and try hard and your best on speechs
2,Classes are very boring and she is not very nice if you have to miss her class. She was very rude to me and was not understandable at all. I would not recommend her.
4.5,Dr. Burns may be unorganized  but she really tries to make the material interesting  and has a lot of unique knowledge about working class backgrounds. She is also very approachable and is interested in different student perspectives. The video choices of hers are also great.
1,I've had to take almost all of her classes for my major. She is the WORST. She is late for almost every class  unorganized  and rude. Her classes are boring and she knows about what she teaches from books (no personal exp.) She is also a BAD advisor!
3.5,Very interesting class. Nobody really participated in class except for a select few. She is disorganized  do not expect your grades back a week after the due date.. maybe a month later. Very easy midterm and assignments. Easy A!
2,If you need organization in a class she will not be the teacher for you. She is very disorganized and just rambles on about the material. She does not give back assignments on time either. I personaly learned nothing in this class.
1,Don't take this professor.
1,No Comments
5,I was unsure at first but this clas tured out to be a lot of fun. The professor worked hard at making sure the class got the concepts of teach social studies. However  if you need a lot of structure and organization in your classes this one isn't for you. But  if you like to learn in a more relaxed  free flowing manner  give it a try.
3,She was a good teacher  but I felt that she forced her feminist views on me a little bit too much. I am not sure how she feels about men  but I like men  so please... lay off the guy-bashing
5,Narrow students can't stand his defense of trad'l family amid a torrent of moral relativism. They're the mainstream sheep
1,If you get him for con law (or any class really) be prepared to learn everything yourself as his lecture adds nothing. Really irritating man.
3.5,"Prof. Wilkins is an intelligent man. He constantly expresses his conservative views regarding****marriage even when it was not relevant to the class discussion. Will gave grade boosts to students he ""recognizes."" Would recommend going to office"
3,"Other comments posted are bunk. Although he is conservative  he is very respectful of students who offer opposing views. Since con law is convoluted  inconsistent  and contradictory  Wilkins presents it as ""clearly"" it is."
1,"Arrogant  narrow-minded  self-loathing  closeted ""gentleman""  who thinks he's the smartest guy ever born (women don't count for anything except makin' babies and cookin' casserole) and is on a mission to prove it to every one of his students."
1.5,Articulate and capable  but has a very narrow conservative point of view. It is his way or nothing. Legend has it that he has the highest GPA in the law school's history and plans to keep it that way.
2.5,Theatrical  entertaining style  but is not open to real discussion of views that counter his John Birch-like constitutional theories. I have to read outside class to learn real constituation law.
5,She is one of the best dance teachers I have ever had. Very clear and very helpful.
5,Tressa is the kindest teacher in the department. She's an easy grader and is very patient with people who struggle. She is also just adorable in general. Such a kind-hearted person.
4,patient and concise
5,I love Tressa! She has brought out the dancer in me that has been dying to come out. She is very helpful and encouraging! I wish the dance department offered non-majors class on a regular basis.
5,Fun  fun  fun  fun!
4,Tressa is a lot of fun to work with. She's very encouraging which is a good thing if you're falling behind in the class. Made the class bearable.
5,gotta love tressa. she's the best!
2,not the best - tries
5,HE IS A GREAT TEACHER I LOVE HIM........
5,I love this teacher. I took three semesters with him  if I have any math class I will take with him with pleasure :)
5,Great teacher and person
5,He was AMAZINGGGGGGGG
5,One of the best math professors there are .
5,I took Professor Burns for Calc II. This professor really knows his stuff. He is very funny and is willing to explain to you until you understands the material. He give practice test before exam and it goes over. if you study the practice test you will pass the exam. Recorded his lecture  posted on YouTube any time you could access and review.
5,Prof Burns absolutely LOVES to help students with Math. He will spend as much time as you need  to help you understand it. He offers multiple ways of solving a problem & lets you decide what works for you. He always makes you feel good about learning something & keeps you interested during the class. Does NOT call on you  if you dont want to be!!
5,Awesome professor
5,Burns is amazing. If all people learned math from burns from start to finish  we would all be math wizards. He'ld give you the shirt off his back to help you out. Great guy and great professor. I wish i could take more classes with him. Tests are easier than the homework. labs help with understanding and boost your grade. A great experience.
5,Awesome professor really knows his stuff.
5,Great teacher!! Math is one of those subjects I hate the most  but prof. Burns helped me understand it in matters of minutes made it much more simpler. Thanks professor Burns.!! We need more professors like you. :)
5,He's an awesome teacher. Best math teacher I've ever had.
5,So  I just want to say that Burns is an awesome teacher...no doubt about it. His love of math makes the class interesting. You know he enjoys what he does from the way he acts. He is always smiling and is very easy going. He has solved difficult problems in front of the class. Very impressive! Side note...he is an avid player of chess! Pretty cool.
5,Best teacher every! Makes sure everyone understands before moving on. He the only math teacher I have had that made math seem fun.
5,Great Prof! Helped me through one of my toughest subjects  math. His explaining was alot better then the book he gave us.
5,This professor is the best I have seen yet. He cares so much about you passing the class  that he will stop teaching just to make sure you get the problem correct. He makes mathematics simple and fun. There is no way you can leave this class confused or angry. He ALWAYS puts a smile on your face. Professors should learn his style of teaching.
5,he is an amazing teacher. i always struggled with math and thought i hated it...he makes me excited about math and it is now my favorite subject! he is one of those teachers you want to stay connected with  THE BEST
5,He is an awesome professor I ever have
5,BEST TEACHER EVERRRRRRRR!
5,Prof. Burns is honestly the best teacher you'll ever come across at STCC! He's amazing  and helps you out as much as he can. He understands the students and is very flexible. I recommend everyone takes him!
5,AWESOME PROFESSOR His class are tough be expected to read and analyze the material because the questions on mid terms and final exams are not going to directly jump out at you unless you actually read read the material. He is a honest person and he is understandable unlike some professors so just be honest with him and you will do fine
4,Awesome Professor. I loved his approach to teaching. We did have a surprise group project which was not on the syllabus but I liked that he graded on individual contributions because some people were just terrible. He was great wit answering questions and clarifying topics and he participated in the forums along with the students. I'd take him.
5,Took him back in the early 90's for English Legal History (2 courses) and one other I forget at the time. Loved the classes at the time  got some of my best undergrad work out of me. Then again  his courses inspired my ill-fated (and short lived) law school career  so not sure if I should recommend him or not.
5,Smart  helpful and fair professor. Don't expect to be entertained  but those are some tough subjects to make interesting.
3,His class is boring. but how can anyone make English Law interesting? Especially during the 16 and 1700 class. his test are diffcult so are his papers. but he does give you a clear direction of where to go.
1,would contemplate slitting my wrists during his class  just for entertainment to keep me awake...so boring
4.5,Sawyer taught some and had us in study groups some. He was very lax about attendance. Grading seemed fair. We had papers but no tests in History of English Law from 16__ to 17__.
5,Professor Sawyer was a great and enthusiastic teacher. Very helpful in guiding you in the right direction.
4,Great professor. Enjoyed his class. I felt he was very fair about grading.
2,He's very knowledgeable but all over the place. It didnt' help that he wrote the book. The only real study group I had in undergrad  and that was so we could teach the material to ourselves. He's smart  but I don't feel like he can convey the material. His tests are also difficult  but fair.
4.5,The class I took with him was Christian History  and Dr. Sawyer did a great job of hitting the main points and keeping class discussion on track. There was a fair bit of reading  a few short papers  one big paper  and no tests! Sawyer's a cool guy  very knowledgeable and a thinker. He does talk quietly  so ask him to repeat if you didn't hear.
3.5,Nice guy  class was boring (I took it for a filler
3.5,No Comments
2,Very intelligent and knowledgable about his topic  but somewhat confusing. COuld have been the content of the course.
1.5,"There was a major lack of communication with this professor. She did not return emails and seemed very confused about grading. I would not recommend her. If you can find another professor for this class... go with it. She takes weeks to grade and is very ""last minute"" about it. I paid for her class and yet was never able to communicate with her."
2,Not a bad Prof  but don't recommend  she messed with BB grades and entered wrong grades  was a pain due to doing it at end of sem. Easy B gotta work a lil for the A
5,SHE WILL KEEP YOU BUSY BUT IT HELP YOU ON THE TEST!!!
1.5,I took the 8 week course online. Pro.Jost gives a test review for midterm and final you look up answers on your own  this only covers 60% of exam. Expect a lack of communication and late grading.
1.5,Med Term online. Easy course. Prof Jost is completely hands off. She does not respond to phone calls or email. Takes several weeks to grade assignments.
5,Professor Jost is awesome. This is a difficult class  but it's not hard if you apply yourself and do the work. My only criticism is that this could really be an online class. You come to class  open blackboard on projector  read powerpoint from blackboard verbatim  go home. North campus isn't the most conveniently located.
2,Mrs. Self proclaimed medical terminology wizard needs to attend a course on common courtesy.. She comes off as arrogant and will not return emails/phone calls. I think she even makes up some of the acronyms used... If you are already pretty fluent in med term and need a somewhat easy class  then take this class  if not look elsewhere.
1.5,In order to be successful you have to be able to do the work on your own. Her test material come from all over the place and are unpredictable. Her study guides are useless because she do not test what is on them. She is hard to get a hold of and never returns calls or emails. Hybrid course tests are in testing center outside of classtime.
2,This class was absolutely horrible. Took her over the summer as a hybrid class. No one could ever get ahold of her...not even our lab teacher. When the tests were actually graded  they were graded by her assistant and graded incorrectly. Im still waiting on my final grade to be posted..which was due yesterday by noon.
4,she was a great teacher and would help anyone on her own time.
1,"This teacher is usless if you are trying to learn. She is very smart i giver her that  but as a teacher useless. Her lectures were nothing to do with the test MOST of the time  the notes she handed out were very confusing and useless  you NEVER knew what was going to be on the test. basically she just is not ""teacher"" material."
1,This Professor Is useless  had her for the online portion of Micro  and it was HELL!!! you don't know whats going to be on the test  and it an online class but you do all the test in Labs + lab test  and she doesn't put your grades up on blackboard after the test. DON'T TAKE HER  RUN!!!!
2,Ms. Jost wasn't helpful at all. As a matter of fact-- still waiting on grades promised earlier. Stay away.
1.5,Very frustrating teacher. Had a hybrid with her  and she doesn't respond to e-mail  no phone calls back. We only got our grades after Ms. Thompson got on to her for not grading tests. Not sure what it is she's doing behind the scenes-- but she needs to use better time management  or work less teaching. Avoid her. Ms. Thompson rocks!
1,I would not take her again. She taught the online portion for the hybrid class  but not the lab. This makes it difficult because it's like 2 different classes! She never responds to emails and doesnt answer her phone. You never know what is going to be on the test  so you have to study everything since you cannot get ahold of her to find out.
3,This is a hybrid class  she will e-mail you within 2 days of you sending it.Tests are multiply choice and given at the beginning of class and then you will take the lab quiz. The reference materials are too numberous making it difficult to gauge what might be on the test. Absorb as much as you can or be sorry on test day.
1,Had her for online mcb2010c  she will not reply to your email..so get used to that! Her tests come from three different sources so prepare to study...
3,She is a very interesting teacher  a little on the nutty side buy very inteligent. She has a habit of geting off subject  but she grades and test fairly. Expect alot of reading and homework time to get an A in her class though.
3.5,I made an A in the class but I had some med. term. experience before I took this class. She is a good teacher  she give practice tests which are similar to the mid-term and final  but there is alot of memorization  so if you DO NOT like to study don't take this course!
5,Very understanding  helpful and eager to teach. Many classes (5-6) were cancelled this term due to various issues - getting both her programs re-accredited and an unfortunate situation with her loved one. No big deal - READ your chapters and you'll be fine. She simplifies everything. If you can't pass this class  you won't pass anyone else's.
5,One of the most enriching classes I have taken during my undergrad. Dr. Siegfried cares not only about her students but about their academic achievement and challenges you to become a better writer  thinker  and human. Her expectations are incredibly high and getting an A is a challenge  so get ready to read and write but the work is well worth it
3,Hardest grader in the BYU English department AND you have to get a 95 to get an A. Basically means that getting an A is impossible (though A- is achievable for the work of an A+ in a different English class). Learned a ton  but worked a ton for it as well. Dont regret taking the class but probably wouldnt take again.
5,Brandie has the highest expectations of any prof I've had at BYU. She makes you earn every single point on tests  papers  and participation. Getting an A from her is a real challenge. BUT she's the best prof I've had. I learned SO MUCH from her and will take every class I can from her in the future. If you really care about your edu  take Brandie
5,Prof. Siegfried teaches her subject so well and in such depth you actually learn truths about life and not just forgettable test garbage. She will invest in you. Prof. Siegfried has written me 4+ quality letters of recommendation (first job  law school app  and after). Dont be afraid of getting a B+ and learning from the best English Prof. at BYU.
1,Don't take this class if you care about your grades. I got high A's on everything (including second test and the final) except for a B on the first test and a B+ on one paper and I got a B- in the class. You are required to comment multiple times each period. Have to keep a time consuming journal. This class is absolutely not worth the effort.
4,Professor Siegfried believes that her students are capable and intelligent  so she pushes your limits more than any professor I've ever had. However  the work is worth it
5,Brandie is one of the best professors at BYU. She makes you work for it  but you cannot help but be completely engaged in her class and come away totally psyched about what you learned. She is a hard grader with a lot of assignments  but if you're not lazy  taking her class will be one of the best academic experiences you'll ever have.
2,Don't take this class unless you're already obsessed with Shakespeare or you're a glutton for punishment. Dr. Siegfried is kind and brilliant  but the course load is ridiculous. The midterm (take-home) takes 6+ hours  the reading is very heavy  and she expects heavy annotation for each reading assignment.
4.5,Dr. Siegfried is the bomb. Her class goes beyond the text
3.5,This was by far one of the most incredible classes I took at BYU. Dr. Siegfried is brilliant and a little bit strange  but she had a way of evoking such great thinking from us during discussions and in papers. Fascinating teacher and very helpful when it came to our capstone paper.
4.5,This was by the far the hardest class I've taken at BYU. Siegfried's expectations are extremely high  but I learned so much and am grateful I had her as a teacher  because every other class will probably seem extremely simple compared to hers. It's a lot of work  reading  writing  but she really knows her stuff and helps you whenever you need it.
4.5,Best Senior Course out there. There is a lot required of you (reading  watching films  etc.) but none of it is wasted time. The midterm and final projects are difficult  but nothing you wouldn't expect. She is open and willing to help you with your writing  and you'll become a better writer from taking her class. AMAZING professor. Beautiful class!
4.5,I took Dr. Seigfried's class duing my Junior year. I'm a 5th year senior now  getting ready to graduate  and I can say that she has been the most influential professor I have had at BYU. The principles she taught stuck  even if  or especially because I had to work for them.
4,I took a class from Professor Siegfriend about a year ago  and I still find myself thinking about the thinks she taught us. She has high expectations. I'm graduating soon and realizing that she was probably one of the most influential professors I've had. Changed the way I look at the world. Highly recommended.
5,This class was SO AWESOME! If you're trying to decide between professors  I would definitely choose her. She made us work hard  but she believed in our ability so I never felt like it was impossible. Her lectures were inspiring and I always learned something. What's really cool about her class is the applications it has to other areas of life.
5,Such a great class! Her class lectures totally blew my mind and I learned tons of useful analytical techniques that I applied to other classes. I especially appreciated the time Professor Siegfried took to conference with every student in regards to how to improve their writing. Highly recommend!
4.5,She is so amazing. She really pushed everyone to think and act like scholars  and not just students. She is way encouraging and super friendly. This class was the highlight of my educational career. I could write novels about how much I like Prof. Siegfried.
4,I remember reading all the postings before the semester started and promised myself I would not let her scare me off after the 1st day. What everyone is saying is right... SHE IS THE BEST PROFESSOR AT BYU. I've never been pushed this hard academically (i usually average low B's  high C's). I just got a B on the midterm. If I can do it anyone can!
2,INSANELY HARD PROFESSOR! I tried to meet with her about certain aspects of my grade  and she seemed extremely hard to get in contact with  as well as unresponsive to emails and inquiries. I would NOT recommend her if you care about your grades at all.
3,She's a very hard professor and she expects a lot out of you. The amount of reading is rather obnoxious and she expects that you'll reach a whole new level of learning just from being in her class. Sometimes she's funny and she seems nice  but I think she expects far too much for a survey class.
5,Great lectures and articulates the concepts very well. Course materials are very well organized. He provides slides that are fill-in-the-blank so you pay attention  and it's not hard to with this teacher. He also records his lectures along with the slides which is a big bonus.
5,Kraay was great lectures were amazing and he used so many examples if you didn't understand the concepts. If you didn't go to lecture then you won't do well. I didn't use the textbook much but it would have helped. Good class.
5,The course itself is really hard  but if anyone was to teach it right it's him. It's clear he's taught this course for a while because he is so good at explaining concepts that are really tough. It takes time to understand but he makes it a lot easier  and cares about his students. Get the textbook  its worth it!
4,The lectures were clear  concise  and they made sense. Prof. Kraay was well spoken and always knew what he was talking about. He could answer any question the students asked him about the material.
5,I freakin love this man. Best professor I have ever had. His lectures are so clear and concise  he knows exactly how to speak so that everyone paying attention really understands. He also records his lectures and posts them so that students who miss class can easily catch up. His tests are very fair and true to the content. I loved him and his work
5,such an easy course if your at least somewhat smart
1,Tests are way too hard for a first year mandatory class. Almost 40% failing by second quiz. So unnecessary to make this course so hard. Ya he cares but doesnt make it easy so whats the point
5,pretty easy as long as u have him. just write what he emphasizes in class and you are golden. dont ever try to write in ur own words  just write down (to highest degree) what he says in class and lecture notes.
2,Nice guy and cares about his students. BUT  really tough course for first year and really hard tests. Ridiculously hard. MUST go to class!!!
2,Exams are based on things discussed in lecture so you need to go to class. Papers are graded exceptionally tough  he doesn't bell curve but the average always tended around a C. Even if you make the improvements based on his comments  it won't mean you'll get a better grade because of how subjectively he marks.
5,This class is an easy A. Kraay makes the content easy to grasp with tons of examples and his lectures are great! Would 100% take his course again!
5,Klaas is a great prof. I highly recommend if you have to take SSH105  make sure he's your prof! You can tell he really cares about his students  I have nothing but respect for the guy. Make sure you attend lectures and do textbook exercises (EMPHASIS ON TEXTBOOK EXERCISES). He's a pretty fair marker and will let you know exactly what he wants.
5,AMAZING prof. One of the best I have had in a long time. Tries to connect everything to the students and encourages discussions in class. . Don't really need the textbook because he posts all the topics in his ppt slides  which is great. Readings are dry but if you go to the lectures  you don't have to do the readings  which is great.
5,Kraay is an AMAZING lecturer  PHL110 was a really interesting course  I actually learned something from him. However  you really cannot skip class (he doesn't post full PPTs) and he is a very tough grader. Even with my interest in the course  I found it really hard to balance such a demanding elective.
1,If you don't go to class you wont pass at all. YOU CANNOT MISS ONE CLASS. He leaves blanks in his power-points and you are only able to find the answers in class. At the end of the class he does not re-post the power-points with the missing words  so you are unable to study off of them if you miss a class. And there is no textbook to look at. DONT.
5,i was nervous because many reviews i read said the course gets difficult. i didn't find that it was difficult at all  and i'm not really a student that keeps up with work. i never even opened my textbook and i always left class 15-30 minutes early for my next one across campus. you can tell he enjoys the topic and care about his students
5,This class probably gave me the most anxiety. I was literally shaking before each evaluation. This class is composed of 4 quizzes. Final is 35%. Prof Kraay is definitely one of the best profs at Ryerson. My anxiety probably had to do with the fact that I was a 1st year student at that time but it also did not help having the lecture Friday evenings
5,Amazing prof. Take SSH 105 with him and you're golden!
5,A great prof and person overall. Tests are always reasonable and to the point. Lectures were always interesting and he even uploads the audio of his lectures which is a GREAT help to auditory listeners!!
5,Klaas was a great prof. Critical Thinking is an incredibly boring and slow course  but you could tell he was passionate about it and really knew the material well (I'm pretty sure he played a role in writing the curriculum?) He posts the audio and powerpoint slides for every lecture on d2l  so you don't have to go to class. Overall a great class
3,Profesor Hafeez is an okay math professor. She knows the material pretty well. The only reason you need to attend class is because of the poppers. If you don't get something you can always ask her questions.
2,Not a very good teacher. Lectures are long and you walk away learning nothing. Don't take her - I respect her origins  but she has a heavy accent and it's quite hard to understand her sometimes. Also  she is BAD AT MATH. Makes MANY mistakes and often confuses the entire class. Stay away from her if you're taking her in a big lecture...
4,I am currently in 1311 online with professor Hafeez. The class layout is very clear. Email response was ok at times response were short & unclear. More importantly  this was an easy A  if you do the homework  take every quiz and remember the poppers. There are several opportunities to do well. I have never been a math person and I did very well!
4,Her class was an easy A. The only thing you really need to do is just study her test and you're good. She sometimes messes up but overall she's a great professor.
2,Took this class for winter mini. I don't recommend her in terms of her notes since her notes are disorganize and lectures are pointless to attend. If you plan on taking mini  be prepare to work hard since this class. Test is like the practice exam  so do it! Try your best to do well on the first 2 exams since exams get harder. There was no final.
2,This online class has lectures twice a week. There are pop quizzes (poppers) in every lecture  practice exams mimic the real exams and your grade on the practice gives you extra credit toward the exams. You have 20 attempts to get 100 on your quizzes and practice exams. You have the option to opt out of the final if you maintain a B or above.
3,This course is very heavy on online HW and quizzes. There is four exams and the reviews tend to be helpful.
4,I am not good at math and she made it very easy to understand. I took this class online and her lectures are posted if you cant log on when shes on. There is homework quizzes and poppers due every week but relatively easy if you follow along. Exams are taken at casa and easy as long as you study and do your work for the class.
3,She can be a mess. Her online lectures are everywhere. Sometimes she forgets to record half the time and if you're not watching it live then good luck. But the material was easy. Stuff you learned in high school so it wasn't a problem.
2,There is a slight communication barrier with her speech which is manageable but  her email etiquette is not very good. She doesn't read your questions fully and answers only half of your questions IF she even responds. Her lectures can be confusing because she gets lost. Her syllabus was very unorganized including the calendar.
2,She makes a lot of mistakes when she does problems on the board  so you have to correct her a lot. It is also difficult to understand her. The good thing is she does the math problems then posts them on her website  so you can look over them later. Quizzes due every 3 days  even on Saturdays  and homework due every week. Poppers are a big thing.
4,This class is really what you put into it. The Homework really helped if you at least try to do it before going to class. It was a usual Math class  she would solve math problems with everyone and she will answer any question we had. The class can be easy if you really do the homework.
3,Ms. Hafeez isn't a bad professor  but she's not going to spoon feed you. If you're good in math and have good study habits  I would say take her. If not  it's best to take someone else. She goes pretty fast so it can be hard to understand what's going on. I passed with an A but I studied my butt off. Her reviews help a ton for tests.
2,She tends to be unorganized  messy with her handwriting and unattentive to the blackboard chat when we  as the students  try to correct her. It was to the point where I actually had to not go to her online class anymore because all she did was confuse me more than she taught me. All in all  I got an A by self-study and teaching.
2,Took this class as winter mini. Lectures were all over the place which made it difficult to follow. Overall do not take her an online class.
5,Currently in her class and it's so easy! just pay attention to her notes  do the practice tests  poppers and quizzes and you should be fine.10% of your grade from your practice test is added to the exam grade. Also if you're happy with your grade after the 3 exams you don't have to take the final. She is very sassy and sarcastic but i find it funny
3,"Ms. Hafeez seemed ill-prepared for class  and normally just winged her teaching. Still  as long as you do the homework  quizzes  and in-class ""poppers"" (daily-work that she uses to check attendance)  than you'll be fine. This class is easy to pass  as long as you do the necessary work."
5,This is a review for her WINTER MINI SESH STATS 2311 First of all  she's very engaging in her live lectures. She cares a lot about her students  often offering to meet w/ us at UH to help. Since this course is only a month long  it's reasonable that she goes at fast pace  so pay attention or self study a little. 3 Tests  quizzes  and poppers.
5,Hafeez is extremely sarcastic and a bit stubborn but overall a good teacher and is willing to answer any questions you may have. Poppers every class session  but are easy. Homework and EMCF due every week  3 tests and an optional final to replace lowest test grade.
5,I took her course online and although I didn't like the online aspect  I truly loved her teaching. She is very funny and caring of her students. She will stay after class hours and help those who need it. I selected lecture heavy because it's all online so it is  lol. Watch her lectures  do her work  & the test will be very easy! An A is possible!
3,Took Women and Creativity and Feminist Philosophy with Camilla. The concepts that are taught are very abstract and I would recommend waiting until jr. or sr. year to take her classes.
3.5,I took Camilla twice. I loved her. The first class was women and creativity. There was a lot of reading  group presentations and stuff but if your intrested in Womens Studies its worth it. I bought some of the books and read majority of the information  payed attention in clas and got an A & B.
5,Dr. Hardy was a great professor. I've read many negative reviews about him but those must have been the students who were expecting hand outs and did not show for class. Dr. Hardy is fair  you must comply when he tells you to show up for class and turn in assignments on time. He helped with test prep and gave extra credit. He was awesome! I'll SAY!
1,Dr Hardy is extremely rude. He will laugh in your face about questions you ask. At one point he told me he wasnt talking to me anymore. Also he is not willing to work with you when you have a issue. Our online system calculates grades wrong I received a D but if you calculate it it adds up to a B he still wouldn't fix it. Saying it wasn't his issue
1,Haven't understood him since day 1. This was one of the hardest things i've ever done. He doesn't explain the problem or how to do it  just writes it straight out of the book and expects you to know it. Hope this helps you decide to not take this class.
4.5,Very Helpful and wants you to succeed! Bring your text book and a calculator. COME TO CLASS  DO NOT BE LATE! Study  study  study! You will pass his class and the compass if your LISTEN and do what he tells you to do... Dr. Hardy wants you to pass and he is there for you! Thanks to Mr. Hardy I am out of Math 98 and well on my way!!!
4.5,Dr. Hardy is a wonderful teacher that knows what he is talking about! A math wiz! COME to class  BE ON TIME! He seems tough but he is preparing you for the Compass Exit Exam and wants you to understand the material. He is very helpful! Come prepared  bring your book and LISTEN IN CLASS! I passed Math 98 & Compass Exit Exam. THANK YOU Dr. Hardy!
1,Dr. Hardy has been the WORSE math teacher I have EVER had!He does not explain the information well AT ALL! If you wanna actually pass this course  DO NOT TAKE HIM!!! He has no remorse for any student  although unless your black! He also does not explain th infomation well at all  along to go with that he tends to mumble!!!
3.5,Dr. Hardy expects you to LISTEN and pay ATTENTION in his class at all times. He offers extra credit..and sometimes give you take home test..Yay! He really wants all his student to do well in his class and gives each student an opportunity to do so....it's up to the student what grade he or she will make.
4,Dr. Hardy expects you to LISTEN and pay ATTENTION in his class at all times. He offers extra credit..and sometimes give you take home test..Yay! He really wants all his student to do well in his class and gives each student an opportunity to do so....it's up to the student what grade he or she will make.
2,This class is not for beginners or for those of you returning to school.You need to have a very good understanding of Algebra to take his classes. His classes are very hard if you have no understanding or are new to Algebra and you must come everyday or you WILL fall behind.He does give chances for extra credit sometimes.DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS.
1.5,Hardy always came to class late  sometime even over 20 minutes. He was always poorly prepared and we rarely covered things on the test. I'm glad I am good at math and already knew the stuff he was trying to teach  because if not  I would have been screwed. I only needed the class for the credit.
2.5,I got 100's on all assignments  and ended up with a C in the class.He will not change a grade  even when wrong Attendance is MANDATORY. I thought the class was extremely easy. Even if you work 10x harder turn everything in on time or never miss a class he won't use that in your favor. The final had things we never learned or talked about in class.
1,Dr. Hardy is HORRIBLE at teaching.. He need to improve in his teaching skills. Attending class everyday is a MUST or you will be left behind. He will give you extra credit to help your grade. He's sorta fair when he feels like it. Go to the tutoring lab because they will help you! I won't recommend his class to people who have a hard time in math.
2,I really stuggle at math and he made me even more aware of the fact that I have a hard time. I cried everyday that I was in that class because he was so hard and I could never understand what he was teaching. He does not explain the material well AT ALL!! I had to withdraw!! It was a horrible experience.
2.5,I agree with the other comment that he isn't for the faint of heart (I was ready to drop the 2nd day
1,Dr. Hardy is the WORST teacher I have EVER had my ENTIRE life!!!!! I wouldn't recommend him to my enemy! I went to his office to ask him for help and he laughed in my faced. I haven't had a math class in 7 years and he was NOT willing to help the slightest bit. I withdrew so I wouldn't fail.
1,Dr.Hardy is the most incompetent teacher I have ever had the displeasure of knowing. Had I not known math before I started his class  I would be failing. He is VERY RUDE and is completely disinterested in his students. If you aren't black he doesnt care about you. So if you are going to take his class  white people  you better get a tan!!!
2,he is the worst teacher possible. no matter what you do you can please him  he will not help and if you ask questions he talks to you like your dumb. when he grades he does not make sense. and when he teaches its like reading off a teleprompter. i have never seen him be nice or fai.
4,Dr.Hardy is a very fair teacher. You MUST DO YOUR HOMEWORK!!hint(you never know when it might count as your test. Math was never easy for me but  I made an A in his class. You will need to go to the study lab but  it pays off.
3.5,Dr. Hardy is NOT for the faint-at-heart  immature or lazy. He expects you to catch on quickly  and is not going to baby anyone. If you do the work  you should pass. Also  he's not very helpful  so be ready to spend time in the tutoring lab
1.5,Most days he is 5-15 minutes late to class  then he sits down and reads off a powerpoint. Pay attention and take notes because this is a class where you do have to teach yourself most of it  it isn't uncommon for him to laugh at your questions and simply tell you it's easy and he already showed how. Even so  class is passable with effort.
5,Oh my God! I made a C on 1301 with Shelton and an A in her class 1302  she got me interested in history  awsome teacher the best. Too bad she will no longer teach at San Jac. srping08 was her last sem to teach..
4.5,She was a great teacher! I took her in a mini over christmas break. She was good. I would suggest her to anyone!
4.5,she's a great teacher.. print out notes from a website and you fill in the blank in class. teaches off overhead. 3 tests and 2 assignments. not a hard class at all. i'm not a history person but i enjoyed it!!
5,Very nice teacher. Her class is easy. Sit there and listen(you dont even have to take notes)and you will pass. Quizzes are extremely easy as well. I would take her for all my other classes as well if I could.
5,I dropped HIST 1301 three times before I took her class. And I got A! Highly recommend to someone who do not like to read too much.
4.5,I was nervous about taking history in a mini but wow. No book. She gives you fill in the blank notes and her tests were so easy that you can't NOT get an A. I learned stuff too! I'm telling yall...take her!
5,attendence is mandatory for extra credit given for showing up and needed if wanting to raise grade. Super silly  cute  short  redhead history loving machine!
3.5,shes good. the fredrick douglas and primary documents stuff is whak though
5,I can't belive she dosnt have a chili peper. she deserves 2. I have never liked History  it was always my struggle class in HS but she makes History fun  interesting  enjoyable and easy. I wish she taught every subject. YOU HAVE TO TAKE HER. I got an A and learned so much and it was my favorite class.
5,Had for 1 and 2 as high school junior. Easy teacher and very enjoyable. NO BOOK!
5,TAKE HER!!!! I dont even like History and her class was a breeze. She makes it interesting I was not bored at all make sure you dont miss class. Shes great cause she makes her own notes that are very clear and helpful. I got A's on all of the tests!!If she were to teach other classes that I needed I would take her again!
5,excellent
5,Hilburn was really nice  easy and simple. everything is spoon-fed elementary knowledge. I HATE history  and have therefore never retained anything from a history course till now.
4.5,Reviews at the beginning of each class. Multiple choice tests. Easy paper. No book required  print 'fill-in' notes off of a website. Easy to get a hold of. Amazing and funny woman. Would DEFINITLY RECOMMEND HER! ...if you can't make it in this hist class..then WoW..... Beth Hilburn=Amazing
5,Great teacher and she makes history extremely interesting. Everyone in the class really liked her.
5,I highly recommend taking history with Ms. Hilburn. She makes learning history fun and interesting. (even if you don't like history) She is very nice  and funny during lecture. And the tests are multiple choice! What more could you want? I wish I had taken her for 1301 as well!
4.5,This was a fun and interesting class!
5,SHE IS AWESOME. I LOVE HISTORY AND SHE MAKES IT ALL THE MORE FUN TO LEARN! NO BOOK NEEDED...MONEy/ TIME SAVER!
5,I love her! She's so cool. Took her 1 & 2. Makes history very interesting! All round...(100x)Easy! If your not good in History...take her! You will love it! Save money because you don't need a book! Print notes off BB and go to class and fill in the blanks. Tests & Quizzes are straight off the notes! I'm going to Miss you MS.HILBURN!!!
5,WOW!! class is sooo easy! If you want an A take her!!! No book needed & she does reviws w/ class b4 test. (which are basically the answers). 50 mult. chice no essays! Taking as summer class now!
3,very nice guy. he comes off very quiet at first but he really does love his students. you do have to try. he will push you for assignments and projects but only because he wants to see everyone do their best
5,Dr. George is an excellent professor. If you do the work and go to class you will do fine. He is also very willing to help any students who ask.
1.5,Goes really fast and acts like you already know everything about fabric. usually tests are HARD. He even told us before the first test that half of us would drop... and he laughed. Also verrrry boring
3.5,george is a pretty good teacher. gives a quiz one day a week and its only 2 questions. there are 3 tests. MAKE SURE YOU STUDY. the class is a joke if you study and take notes. power point every day. he goes kinda fast so i suggest using a computer for notes. he isnt really into teaching this class b/c hes engineering so hes pretty lenient .
2,hes a great teacher! he gives alot of information. just pass his tests and quizes and you'll do great in his class. you dont need to buy the txt book
4.5,He really gets down to buisness. Class always got out a few minutes early and he always got everything in. Hes very helpful if you need help just go to him. The only thing that can be a downside is he went very fast. But if you ever missed something in the notes he was willing to give it to you after. Take all the notes and you have no problems
3.5,gives a lottt of notes on the board and projector. take good notes because the tests are kinda hard and you need all that information to answer the specific questions on the test. doesnt really give hw
2.5,Does he know his stuff? I dont think so. Ask him a question and he does not know about it. Just keeps giving stupid assignments and thinks he is doing a great job. If you want to learn something forget ths man...if u just want to pass take him
4.5,what a fungi
4,No Comments
4,Easy class. Makes the class interesting. I would recommend taking him.
3.5,Prof. George gives hard tests  a lot of the time asking specific questions  he is very knowledgable about the subject and even though he doesnt take attendance showing up on days when everyone else doesnt results in bonus points on exams which are needed
5,He expects a lot from students but if you go to class he is very helpful.
4,He goes really fast- but you learn alot
2,He is an awful teacher. Cancelled class so many times in the semester with short notice without approving it through the department. Assigns essays which are very subjective and unclear grading. Wouldn't recommend him.
1,This class was just him trying to prove to the students that he was a good parent. He is very arrogant and self consumed. He provided no help and did not even bother to learn our names. He also cancelled class way to many times  and we probably did not cover half of the material we were supposed to. If you want to learn  do not take him.
2,He cancled class too often and the material  half was intro-psyc and the other half was his life story. This teacher is concieted and self righteous  rarely alowing students to explain themselves when a question is asked  instead he opts to hear himself speak. Easy enough if you can memorize and regurgitate. Don't take if you actualy want to learn.
3.5,He is ok. 4  6 page essays. 4 exams. Exams are a bit tricky but not impossible if you study. He canceled class a total of 5 times. Nice guy. He is alright.
5,Professor Burge absolutely knows his stuff. He is passionate about child development and mentions his grandson and basketball team every class. Only take 1 exam and the final. 1 or 2 BB assignments and 3 observations of kids under 18. I would definitely take him again.
5,Professor Burge is one of the nicest and most interesting teachers that I've had so far at Towson. He is extremely interesting and his class is a piece of cake. You do have to study for his tests and memorize quite a bit for the essays  but other than that it's worth taking his class. If I had the chance I would take another one of his classes!
4.5,TU is lucky to have him as a prof! One of the best teachers that I've ever had. Very entertaining and straight forward. Gives great examples about what he is lecturing on. Take good notes  review them before the exams- no text needed. Can't wait to take him again!
1.5,Such a good professor! His tests are straight from the notes and he pretty much tells you whats going to be on them. Makes class very interesting because he talks about his experiences as opposed to lecturing from notes. Highly recommend  and don't buy the book.
5,Really enjoyed this class. Do not buy text  all info provided in notes and exams are from his notes. He has very interesting examples from his experience. Pay ateention  study notes  you will do well. I looked forward to this class and am taking a class with him next semester because of this. Sometimes he comes off a little sharp but he is nice!!
4.5,very nice guy. laid back and makes class interesting. he knows what hes talking about and very knowledgeable. doesnt require the use of a textbook. tests are straightforward. 3-5 page paper on a disability you take on for a day. would definately recommend to others
4.5,very nice guy. laid back and makes class interesting. he knows what hes talking about and very knowledgeable. doesnt require the use of a textbook. tests are straightforward. 3-5 page paper on a disability you take on for a day. would definately recommend to others
5,AMAZING TEACHER. Knows his material. Very entertaining. Makes going to class fun. Would take him a million times more. No textbook and is very straight forward about the exams
3,Professor Burge was a good teacher and makes it clear what is going to be on each test. There are a few out of class assignments that take a lot of effort to complete. Make sure you work hard in this class because Professor Burge has very high standards.
4,Great Class with lots of discussion. There is no textbook. Prof is funny and has tons of experience in the field. Would highly recommend this class. No exams but lots of papers to write.
3.5,Pretty laid back class. No use of textbook and we pretty much ran through test material because we got off topic so much. Always got out 45 min. early  and always told us what would be on the test (mult. choice and lots of short answer/long answers). Also there are 2 observation papers that he grades harder than you would expect! Interesting guy.
4,"Burge is the man! Loved taking this class with him. There is no assigned textbook for this class so all material is straight from lectures. Has a tendency to ""wonder"" at times during discussions but overall  very pleased. Two exams  two observation papers  one final project. His expectations can be somewhat vague but great guy overall! Take him!"
5,Fun teacher. Lots of discussion. NO reading. Definitely knows the subject well as he has had a lot of jobs in the field.
3,Class was okay i guess. If you like a class with stated guidelines DO NOT TAKE. I was often unclear about what he expected from me on the work because he never stated what he wanted exactly  but if you do bad on the work he does let you do it over again. test are easy if you study. lots of stories about his son. he is over all a nice man.
5,He is extremely in to teaching and has a very good way of getting points across  however  you really need to study for his tests. Not necessarily the multiple choice  but the essays. He is very down to earth and funny but don't expect an A unless you put forth some effort. Get ready to hear funny stories  mostly about his son. Great guy!
2.5,Don't buy the book  he never uses it. If you like listening about his son  great because that's all you are going to do! It was an easy class but I didn't care for him because all he talks about is himself and not what's on the test. It's an easy class though.
5,Some instructors insist their students memorize a bunch of unimportant facts  like dates or names. Good instructors make sure that the ideas seep in  and don't focus on useless details. Jeffrey is a good instructor. I feel like I genuinely learned  and I feel like my perspective on ethics have made a change for the better after finishing his class.
4.5,Like they say easy class  but what i liked most was the fact that he pushed us to be better people and actually apply what we learned into our life. Don't take if you want a challenge  but take if you want to be a better person.
2,Prof. Nielsen  while a good person  did not teach well. We hardly learned anything in class. He seemed to not care about the class or what he taught. It was not challenging at all  despite the fact that it was an Honors course. I recommend him if you want an easy A  but not if you want education.
4.5,Prof. Nielson is way awesome. His class is easy  and he's always willing to help you. He's so lenient when it comes to grades and when you turn things in  it's awesome.
4.5,Great class! It was easy but I learned a ton!
4.5,Nielson's class was great. Assingments wern't too hard and had very clear due dates. The class atmosphere was laid back. Nielson's knowledge of the subject is pretty vast and he makes it easy for one to learn a lot.
5,No Comments
5,Class is too easy  but I guess that's why its 105. Nielsen is a good professor  seems very widely read and educated  and was fascinating to discuss serious questions with.
4.5,Incredible professor and human being. If you get a chance to take a class of his while at the College  do it! You won't regret it!
4.5,This class was real easy. The guys knows what he is talking about.
4.5,Makes an impossibly difficult subject at least mildly comprehensible. Moves very fast  so be careful. Assigns more reading than necessary  but lectures very clearly. A nice guy -- doesn't grill you in class. The class would be great if we didn't have to move so fast. Should really be a 5-credit class.
5,Brilliant. And open to non-traditional approaches (fiction  plays  whatever) to the third year paper.
4,Turned me off law school.
5,One of the best at HLS. It is Con Law  so it ain't easy  but he does a great job of explaining difficult and complex topics. Not the most famous Con Law prof at HLS  but far more engaged in teaching than Tribe. Take this for a solid base  then Tribe for Advanced Con Law.
5,Clarifies a lot of tough law  but the class is still hard.
2.5,"Awfully dodgy character  if you ask me. I never like his ""guess what I'm thinking"" tests  especially the essays. Really didn't understand the usefulness of the tennis quizzes either. I guess I have a lot to learn."
4.5,Rockin'!
4,All her test are online  don't stress. They can be taken more than once.
5,Great professor! Every test is online and you can take them unlimited times. Only 1 essay for this class. Very easy class!!
4,I absolutely love Dr. Woolard
5,Awesome class with awesome professor. Will use these skills for the rest of my life! Thouroughly enjoyed this class with Woolard.
5,This Class is very easy. I recommend taking it during the summer sessions if you want to avoid the boring lectures. I took it during the summer and we didnt have to attend class very often  just did the the online tests and worksheets which are very book based and(also ask very personal health questions)and you'll Ace this class no problem as I did
5,Literally made me into the person I am today. Would not be where I am without her.
5,Awsome teacher. And her class is a complete waste of time as far as learning is concerned. But she could tell you eveerything you need to build your schedule and complete your major. And is just very passionate about sports. I recommend her highly
5,fun loving teacher... great job
2,Easiest class I've taken  but also the biggest waste of time. Didn't learn anything. We met most days and just watched her search on google. She was not prepared. She has an open door policy  so she will always help you. Good at giving advice  but bad teacher.
2,Easy class but she gets off subject bad. She spends most of the time taking about what to do if your going to be a teacher  which has nothing to do with the class. All the test are online but you have to look up every question because she goes over none of it in class.
4.5,easy  easy  easy. tests are online and you can retake them as many times as you need. If you need an elective. take this class.
5,Love Love Love her!!! The only professor at Campbell that has never shut me down when I have ask for help. She is very helpful and inspiring :) Wish she taught more classes.
3,she is extremely easy. she cancelled class at least 10 times in one semester because she had other obligations. All quizzes are online. don't even have to buy the book because the labs are online!
5,Very Best Professor! Dr. Woolard is a true college professor and she really cares about your grade and you!
5,Best teacher at campbell truly cares
5,Doc is the best campbell has to offer. So down to earth an easy. Take her. You want regret it.
5,the best at campbell
5,man if u dont like this teacher you like no one. incredubliy easy and an so down to earth. take her
5,Doc. is the best teacher anyone could ask for  she rocks! She is willing to do anything to help you  and such a nice person  if you make less then an A in any of her classes  you need to drop out of school  you dont need to be here!
5,Dr. Woolard is a good professor she is more than fair  she goes out of her way to help the student. She will help your GPA  I have never made less than an A in any of her classes.
3,I practically have to do the entire lab before class if I want to finish  but he gives full credit regardless of how much you turn in. Quizzes are difficult.
4,It was a lab class  so mostly homework done in class. He was very good at explaining the information though  and was willing to help you  as long as you don't tick him off with stupid questions. be respectful and inquisitive and you'll do fine
3,His assignments are easy. Go to class and listen  you can sleep if you like. Can't review his lectures (not posted online) never follows schedule. TESTS ARE IMPOSSIBLE  LITERALLY  BUT......He curves test like none other. For example a 35/50 on one test was an A  so just study at the last minute for the tests and beat your classmates.
4.5,I first took this class with Robert Ridge. Both professors are good and give good demonstrations  but Matheson did more demonstrations and his slides had more images. As a visual learner that was very valuable to me. I understood much more in his class. Tests are in class. I recommend him to students who are single parents due to his flexibility.
1.5,He may be smart and know his stuff but he is a HORRIBLE professor and I love physics. He constantly talks down to the class and acts like he is revolutionizing your world view  or like you have never thought about the universe before. He rushes over formulas and never does them with you  he just shows a slide of how he did them.
5,One of the best teachers/lecturers I've ever had! Matheson is the bomb  and very considerate of the students he's teaching. Take some time over weekends to watch physics movies online-- grabbing the conceptual picture will help tons!
2,Extremely unorganized lectures. Nearly impossible to take notes from. Rarely has a physics demo actually work.
4.5,He expects a lot from his student you will need to work. However he will help you if needed. He usually grades on a curve  and a very kind one at that. He's friendly and will gladly have a chat about physics and how it works  especially if it helps your understanding in the class.
5,Professor Matheson is a very smart and nice guy. He is more than willing to explain any question you have until you understand the concept. He gives difficult homework and test but grades it very graciously. If you do the work you will get an A in his class.
1.5,Professor Matheson is an extremely nice man  but makes no sense whatsoever. Because his lectures were so hard to follow most of the class was left reading the textbook  going to the Physics lab  and studying in large groups for hours upon hours.
2,Adorably dorky  but not a great teacher. What he teaches in class you understand  but his assignments - which make most of your grade - you can't understand. If you must take this class from him BE SURE TO COME TOGETHER AS A CLASS AND START A STUDY GROUP! Only way I have survived the semester.
1.5,Easy going nice guy but class was really boring he lectures the whole time and its hard to stay interested. Plus the subject is very difficult. Lots of homework reading and test. Don't reccomend for a general requirement class
4,He's fairly easy  and grades on a curve. He's a pretty mellow and nice guy. Even though you don't 'have' to go to class much  I think it helps because he does a good job at explaining concepts in the book
2.5,There are quizzes every other day and assignments every other week. The questions are ridiculous. He asks things that don't make any sense. This class is boring. However  he lets you take the tests in class and lets you talk to students in the class. Avoid this class at all costs. I didn't learn anything.
4.5,A nice man that knows what it is that he is teaching. I don't understand the class at all  but it is enjoyable at times. The textbook doesn't explain things well  although we use it a lot. An expensive class. Maybe not a first choice class.
4,He is a great teacher! Cool thing was is he has actually been out in the feild before teaching! You will learn a lot if you come with the right attitude! I am not interested in Astronomy but he is  so it makes it more interesting. Don't take him if you fall asleep easy! I like his class  but go to class  and he like people who ask questions.
5,AWESOME TEACHER---one of the best. He actually has a degree in physics--unlike some other physics teachers at UV-high (UVSC). He explaines things VERY clearly. I would highly recommend him.
1.5,I found him very confusing. The text book is huge and he doesn't explain the concepts very well. If you can avoid him  do.
4,He isn't very clear as a teacher and his tests are hard but he is very helpful. He is very generous grading as well. He won't fail anybody that tries.
5,He is a great Professor. I have learned so much in his class. He makes class fun and very interesting. He shows how physics applies in our life. He is very knowledgeable about the subject and I would highly recommend him as a physics teacher.
5,Prof. Murray is very knowledgable and her lectures are really interesting. Heavier on readings but as long as you read them before the tests you'll be fine. Very fair grading.
4.5,Knowledgeable professor. The material lends itself to dryness  because much of it is a repeat of material studied in several other MCC classes. Not a demanding course if you stay on top of the materials and screenings. I enjoyed the class  her structuring of the class and her dry wit.
4,I took Television History and Form with Professor Murray this semester. She is a good professor  very clear. A bit boring at times but overall a good class. Grading is done in a very straight forward manner  and if you go to class and do most of the readings/screenings you will get a good grade.
3,She is a very fair grader and all assignments are fair. She is also very nice and helpful. It was her first time teaching Amateur Media  she knew a lot but often her knowledge was around photography  the class was kind of boring and the articles and lectures were often common sense or dull. The class was more history based then I thought.
5,One of the best classes/profs I've had at NYU.
2.5,i thought this would be an fun class  but she's quite a hard ass. TONS of reading. i thought the focus would be more on the cultural impact but it's all technical and about rules and regulations of TV. i kind of hate this class.
4,Great teacher. It's a fun subject and she is organized and clear about what she requires. The midterm and final are extremely straightforward (just do the readings at some point). The research paper is work  but the fact the subject matter is interesting  so it goes by fast. I would definitely recommend this professor and class!
4,She's very nice and she knows what she's talking about. Make sure to take good notes!! Bc the tests rele come from paying attention to what she says in class. A lot of rdgs  pretty lecture based  but with very fun  enjoyable TV clips. She's cool!
4,Awesome. Very knowledgeable  has a clear plan of where she wants to go with the class. Concentrates a lot on radio in the beginning  so expect a lot of historical readings. Very good about answering questions and clarifying when you are confused. Highly recommended.
1,*
5,Very interesting professor. Very nice  helpful  willing to work with you. Available to students. Not a difficult professor - fair. Normal work load.
5,really really easy. she's nice
5,No Comments
5,Show up  review a bit  pass. It's that easy with such a brilliant professor as Bvb. No reading required  just a CD that is optional if you need help reviewing before the 3 tests. A visual analysis paper that should not be an issue if you spend some time on it. There might be a lot of material to memorize but Bvb curves a lot.
5,One of the best professors I've had. She not only wants you to pass but actually do well. She allows you extra credit if she sees you put in effort. Her lectures are very interesting  she is extremely knowledgable/passionate. It is so different from your other classes just by content- very refreshing. You will need the CD  which is a bit expensive.
5,She's my favorite art history professor! She's super sweet  is a practical professor. She doesn't make you remember dates which is awesome if you know art history classes. She's clear on her requirements and always accessible.
5,Professor Von Barghahn-Calvetti  or 'BVB' as she prefers  is easy to like because she clearly enjoys her work. Lectures are extremely well-researched. If you're looking for an easy A with little work  go elsewhere. She expects a lot of research for papers & presentations. Still  she is always available for feedback & is generous with grading.
3,For the sake of your sanity  do not take this class unless you have a painful passion for memorizing 600 paintings (and their artists) for 3 in-class exams. Extra credit is generous but staying awake in lectures is grueling. As a Finance major  there was nothing interesting about the class and I don't recommend it for analytical people.
2,I have trouble understanding why all of the other reviews are so positive. She was an easy grader  but we had to do excessive research for oral presentations. Also  she made many political comments that were unrelated to the course  regarding feminism  the ACA  the Iraqi war  etc. Her comments were unprofessional at best. Do not recommend.
5,BVB is the BEST. she's absolutely life-changing  and one of the leading experts in her field. so so brilliant. she's such a wonderful person who truly wants her students to do well & is willing to go above & beyond to help. Tests are hard so you need to put in the work and don't skip class. textbook is usually a CD of images that you will use
4,BVB is great. She's really passionate about her field and her knowledge and research is impressive. She wants you to be as passionate about the information as she is. She's clear about assignments and will gladly clarify. That being said  there is so much information to memorize for exams and her tests cover a lot of material.
5,BvB is one of the best professors at GW. She has a love for Renaissance art  which is infectious. Her lectures are fascinating and clear  and she is a pretty easy grader. She really cares about her students  so it pays to get to know her. I have taken many classes with her and hope to take more. She is everything a student could ask for.
2.5,Very long winded lectures. Seemed angry when asked questions. Claimed tests would not be too hard  but required absurd amounts of information memorized.
4,Great  engaging professor but the only reference for the class is a $90 CD that only works on PCs which is really annoying.
4,The one bad part is an expensive CD. But  we could drop 2 of 4 quizzes  bring in a few pictures of work into the tests  email for notes if we miss class  and do lots of extra credit. No readings  and class prepares you for tests.
4,"BVB is a lot of fun  and truly understands the hard parts of being a student (""I won't make you do readings  I used to hate that..."") She has extensive knowledge  though I wish she would focus a little more on the art and less on the politics and royal affairs. If you take Northern  be ready to study many French chateaus and royal portraits."
4.5,You have to know 300-400 art pieces for both the midterm and the final. As a result you won't remember much from the course  but she does give alot of extra credit and she seems to want people to enjoy the course. Her Spanish Art one course was the best because you really get to look at art from a monarch's perspective. It is easy to dote on her.
5,BVB is a great teacher! She tells you a lot of information in each lecture  but she will repeat things that are likely to be on the exam. Take notes and remember artists' more famous works. She's extremely nice. Take her classes!
5,this woman is so amazing and nice. very friendly and will even email you notes or extend deadlines even if your excuse is because you woke up late or are too lazy to do it on time. the class however is so boring and depressing. exams are easy if you study the notes and memorize the slide names and artists
4.5,She is a very good teacher. Very knowledgeable about art history. Her lectures are very thorough and you have to able to take good notes. Her exams are hard but she curves and there is extra credit  so its not too bad
5,An amazing teacher and a great human being. Knows a lot of the subject matter. Exams are challenging but great. Art Historians have to take al least one of her classes. You will be able to keep waht you have learned for teh rest of your life. Great Class.
4.5,Wonderful! She talks fast  but you can always ask her questions. Very easy to talk to. She is cute and a sweet heart. You won't forget her. Take her if you are interested in art.
5,I took two courses with her in the same semester-I loved it! I couldn't have been more excited to wake up at 9 am. Her teaching method is to tell a story  sometimes making implications. Its like going to listen to your favorite aunt and have her show you pictures and tell you stories about them. Great professor! Fair grader
1,Terrible teacher. Avoid.
4,Nice person  not a nice professor.
1.5,This was the worst professor I've ever had at GW. Seriously avoid him. He's mean  overly critical to students  and just plain down rude if he doesn't like you. He seriously scared me. He was just that bad of a professor. Take another class because most likely you won't get an A or even a B in his class.
1,This professor is hands down terrible. He is condescending  critical  and extremely rude to your face. His grading is unfair and harsh  and he offers no help or extra assistance that is of any use. DO NOT take this class.
5,I really enjoyed this prof. He has high expectations and helps a lot too. Attendance is mandatory  as well as participation. I learned a lot in his class and have lots of respect towards his knowledge.
5,IGreat professor! You can tell he's passionate about the subject  and clearly expresses his expectations. He's also very helpful with papers and assignments. You don't really need to read the books  because of the films. As long as you participate in discussions and get on his good side (which won't be hard if you go to class)  you'll do fine.
1.5,"Forget ""tough but fair"". He's not fair  and his toughness is artificial. If you fail to make the arguments he wants you to make  in the way he wants you to make them  the grade you receive will not reflect your work."
2,Professor Fruscione was incredibly condescending. He clearly picked favorites and if he didn't like you  your grade would reflect that.
3.5,I took the Shakespeare UW with this prof  and he's a little harsh. He teaches you what you need to know  and I loved watching the movies. He grades really strictly. Make sure you develop all arguments. PARTICIPATE IN CLASS!!!!
3,Great Teacher...not so great of a person. I actually did better in this class than I thought I would. Attendance is mandatory (you get 3 after that it's your head) and participation is KEY. I would highly recommend taking a different UW if you can. I didn't really learn anything after this course either. FAIL
5,I took the class because I thought it sounded interesting. He's a really nice guy  but grades kinda harshly. You are allowed to miss 3 classes  but after that it hurts your final grade. There are 3 papers: 2 are 6-7 pages  1 is 11-12. You will definitely be able to better analyze both literature and film after this class. He's a great teacher!!!
2.5,Ehh
4.5,Is a tough grader  will get really snippy if you're tardy more than once  will get snippy if you are absent more than twice  will get irritable if not enough people participate during class  even with all his moodiness he was very good at critiquing papers and always wanted his students to progress. YOU HAVE TO DO THE WORK! and come to class.
3.5,"Okay  Fruscione seems like a good guy. Definitely not an ""easy"" or ""generous"" grader... His moods seem to change frequently  sometimes he's really friendly  other times  he essentially will tell you have no concept of the English language whatsoever...This class was a lot of work for UW..."
4,Class was extremely boring at some times. The papers (about 6 or 7) were a hassle  but manageable. Easy grader.
5,He is very nice and helpful. Always available for office hours and answers emails very quickly. I really enjoyed the topic and he made the class fun. He picks good plays/movies and the papers aren't that hard. There are about 5 papers total and they're all about 5 pages the final paper is totally your choice on topic
5,Prof Fruscione is a great teacher! Really fun and simple class  read books and watch the film adaptations and write a paper about it. You can pick your own topic for the 10 page paper at the end and he's always open for questions. Even though we can miss class  I went to most of them because we always had good discussion. Highly recommended
1,avoid
4,This class was fairly simple and engaging for those who wanted to get something out of it. The teacher is a fun guy who is sometimes a little too lenient with the less bright people in the class. But having us listen to Chris Walken perform The Raven was awesome.
5,Professor Joe is a nice guy and is genuinely interested in his students getting something out of his class. This class is all about group discussion and hios film choices are overall really good and interesting. He is a fair grader who tends to give you the benefit of the doubt. I would recommend this class and professor to any student.
4,I had some health issues this semesters and she was very caring and willing to help. Class was a little boring  it's mostly just grading your grammar worksheets together  I almost wish it had been a little bit more challenging. Careful though  she was a much tougher grader than I expected for the big projects.
5,Professor Shelton was by far the best English professor I have ever had. She works with each student personally in order for them to be as successful as possible. She also has you work on one subject all semester long so all of the work you do is helping you develop your final paper. She is super compassionate and loving to all!
5,Professor Shelton was one of the best teacher's I've had my entire academic career. She helps you understand the why behind the papers she gives. She is very clear on her expectations and is very enthusiastic on what she teaches. She uses the book pretty exclusively  so Google will not save you.
5,I loved Linda! She was so fun. Even though there was a lot of homework she made it worth it because she would help you through it. We did a lot of group assignments and group talking. I would take her class again.
5,She is like the little grandma that everyone wishes they had. She wants her students to pass and will help them make that possible. If she sees your effort  she will work with you. The whole semester was spent on writing the final paper  by building it piece by piece. She's funny and really helpful.
5,Linda is a fantastic English teacher. She explains things clearly and openly. She will be the first to tell you that the assignment is odd or might not seem worth while  but she explains the why behind it. She is open and honest when she gives feedback  and really gives you keys to succeed.
4,She was a good english professor. There were times in her class where she loved talking about political and controversial things  which wasn't too relevant to english. But overall  she stayed on track. Her grading for papers is very fair and she gives great feedback on how you can improve. I would take her class again.
5,I loved taking this class from Linda. She is great! She was very understanding about everything. I turned in a few assignments late and she didn't mark me down for it. All she really cares is that it is completed and that we did out best. There are a lot of papers but she is willing to help you and accommodate.
5,She is literally THE BEST. She wants her students to succeed and wants you to get the best grade possible in her class. She does one on one conferences when it comes to midterms and your final paper. And she doesn't do a finals test! Your last research paper is your final and you finish the class a week early! Definitely has been my favorite.
4,Professor Shelton is not a teacher for the lazy or for the procrastinator. She is willing to work with you and will talk to you about grades if you want to know why you got a certain score. You will generally be writing a paper every week  but as long as you keep up with homework  you won't get bogged down.
4.5,Professor Shelton was one of the best professors I have had. She is always there for you when you need help during office hours  after class  and she is invested in student's success.
5,Linda is the kind of professor that makes you love the subject. Grammar is tolerable at its best  but Linda made it interesting and fun. She is a very skilled instructor and she knows her subject matter. I believe attendance is key for receiving an A  but I never wanted to miss her class  so this wasn't a problem.
1.5,If you take this class be prepared to write a lot. Linda is a harsh grader with the major assignments. Most of the assignments were a waste of time. She is not helpful and her instructions are unclear. She told me I had a good topic to write about and my summaries of articles were good but then tore apart my final paper. Don't take this class!
5,Linda is awesome! This is the most interesting  most fun  and most relevant grammar class I've ever taken. The best part about Linda is that she thinks grammar is stupid so while she is teaching it  she admits it has flaws and encourages discussion about it.She brings in readings that challenge the idea of traditional grammar. Take this class!
5,LInda is so nice and so much fun. This class really prepares you for all of your other college classes. She will help you with anything  and she is way funny too.
5,Took this class as a hybrid  then needed to drop the class a few weeks in due to some schedule changes. She is a great professor  generates good discussion  interesting  and fun. However  as far as a 2010 course goes there is a LOT of writing: Way more than other professors for 2010 Several page papers due almost every week along with assignments.
5,Shes wonderful  and considering i hated the subject thats saying something. Learning about research papers is tedious on a good day but shes fun and smart and thought provoking and i never dreaded going to class. It certainly is work but never more than can be handled. You may not like the subject but you walk out with skill.
5,She is THE BEST professor I have ever had. She makes things incredibly clear and she teaches the simplicity of things without making you feel stupid. She is so helpful if you don't understand something and she is very approachable! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PROFESSOR! SHE'S INCREDIBLE!
1.5,very unclear does not know what she actually wants your papers to be about. You get to choose your topics but she is very particular. Grades harshly!
5,She is AWESOME! she's funny and makes class entertaining by telling jokes and stories that relate and help us understand the subject. She made grammar FUN! not too many tests (multiple choice done on a scantron) and a paper or two. Definitely recommend taking her! She's like a spunky  young  funny version of my grandma!
5,Aurora is fantastic! Really cares about our projects and makes an effort to support us towards creating a fantastic final work.
4,Aurora is a really great lecturer! The class was interesting and a delved into a variety of topics regarding modern media. You have to do the readings though and show up to lecture. Most of the material on the quiz is stuff she lectures on. TA's do all the grading as another review said. Overall  would take her again.
5,Great professor and amazing lecturer. Class consisted mainly of quizzes and papers. TA's do most of the grading.
2.5,Took her for Crime  Media  Violence. Very charismatic and interesting. Funny dorky jokes propel the otherwise dull lectures. Very hard grader  doesn't really tell you what you did wrong/what to write on. Not the best  not the worst.
5,She was a great lecturer and engaging  particularly considering it is a large lecture environment.
1,Talks way too much about herself  makes unfunny side remarks none of which have anything to do with the course which is actually  despite her  very interesting. If you want eye-candy  there are other places to look. Not hot  not funny  just... not.
4.5,I had her for two classes in one semester (Advertising & Society and Media History of NY). Definitely knows her stuff about advertising and increased my knowledge and interest in the subject. But she is a tough grader.
5,had her for advertising and society. extremely clear  knows what she's talking about. class was straight forward so there was no need to go to her to ask questions. definitely need to study for exams/tests but easily comprehensible material
1,Worst professor I've ever had. Refused to read my paper or answer my questions when I went to office hours and instead sent me to her TA. Absolutely thinks she's GOD and takes herself way too seriously. She's cold hearted and only cares about herself. I think she got pissed no one came to her lectures and failed everyone for the final out of spite.
1,Awful teacher. Incredibly boring. Would teach lectures and no one would show up. She would make sassy comments at people who did come. Very hard grader. Not a lot learned. You can take a lot better classes than this at NYU  do not do it.
4,Definately not the best at NYU  but she knows her material. Yet  she is so nerdy and laughs so much at her own dull jokes that her class is not really what you would call fun. Her quick facts are cool though.
4,I have Prof. Wallace for Advertising and Society  and I love her! She obviously knows a lot about the subject and has a lot of interesting  educated opinions (although she doesn't object to discussion). She has a lot of visuals (necessary for this kind of class) and plus  she's just adorable! But she doesn't take****  so don't give her any.
2,If you can take this course with someone else  do so. She takes herself too seriously. The lectures are dry and boring.
1,Boring class  boring material  monotonous lectures and cold atmosphere  I'd rather be giving blood. I highly do NOT recommend this professor to anyone definitely take another professor even if it conflicts with your schedule you'll be VERY thankful trust me.
5,Professor wallace clearly knows what she is talking about and she always tries to make the class interesting. I HIGHLY recommend her as a professor for any subject within communications.
1,Most boring class ever. If the material wasn't coma enducing enough  her monotonous voice should just about do it.
5,Aurora is the best professor NYU has to offer.
4.5,Great professor. Great class. Interesting subject matter. Pick a good TA  or the recitation is worthless. But  Aurora does a great job on her own. The people that complain are lazy.
3.5,Wallace is a pretty good professor.Her lectures were a bit dull esp at 9:30am but the material is easy enough and as long as you read most of the txt and attend most of the lectures and RCT you shouldn't have any trouble.The hardest part about the class was finding the motivation to actually attend.
5,Her class is really interesting  and its sucks that its early in the morning because its easy to fall asleep...but her class is interesting and shes really funny. Her tests aren't that difficult if you keep up with your work.
3.5,Ted is definitely a great teacher. Truly intelligent and influential in the communication field. Sometimes name drops. I had a really bad TA so it made the experience difficult. However  class was thought provoking and reading-intensive.
4.5,Very knowledgeable prof in MCC dpt. Widely covered issues and more-than-interesting lecture that makes legal issues interesting and inspiring. Although course work is a little bit heavy  not a big deal if you can handle Intro to media study well. DO NEED RESEARCH AND FINAL PAPER
3.5,Really interesting class  very knowledgable  few quizzes  no textbook  simple and easy papers. Magder is great
3.5,Ted is incredibly knowledgable and well-prepared. His lectures are very fast paced. You need to take notes on a lot of what he says  and not just rely on the powerpoints he posts on NYU Classes. He is not always clear but is willing to help.
4.5,Hands down one of my favorite professors at NYU. Extremely accessible  knowledgable  and well-connected. Every lecture may not always be of interest to you (since multiple sectors are covered)  but you can tell he's very prepared and interested in what students have to say. Work was fairly demanding  but manageable. Highly recommend.
5,Ted is a great professor
5,First  ignore the Steve Jobs comparisons. Black turtlenecks with black jeans are the only things the two have in common. I have had him twice now  and really enjoyed his business class. He can be a bit self-absorbed  and loves to namedrop. Nevertheless  great professor who cares about his students and the university. Highly recommended.
3.5,Ted is a great teacher and you really learn a lot in his class. His tests require a lot of studying but they aren't too bad. He gives many assignments but they are mostly interesting. Overall  Ted's lectures were usually interesting. Sometimes they were quite boring.
4,I had him for Business of Media. I learned a lot in the class  but he didn't really teach  everything was mostly self-taught (due to the weekly blog posts). He was interesting and had cool speakers and the workload was pretty heavy (a lot of writing)  but I do see the advantages of taking this class as it is very applicable to the real world.
4.5,I really enjoyed Ted Magder! His lectures were interesting and relevant. I appreciated his interest in his students opinions on current events and his humorous approach to teaching. Also  he HARDCORE reminds me of Steve Jobs.
1.5,nothing against him  the course material was not for me.You pick a media sector (either print video games  telecomm tv film or music) read the trades and blog then write a 45 pg research paper. This class has no critical thinking/theory and you hear stories about his famous friends and his soccer fanaticism.He has a soothing voice.
1,Meh. Overrated. Material is interesting though.
5,Great Professor. Very interesting guy. def take this class. If you take good notes and skim the text book the tests aren't too bad.Explains everything well  warm person.
4,Intro to Media Studies  great class. Lectures online  doesn't take attendance  but go to recitations because they do help with understanding some of the more complex articles!
4,Magder is the best! Lecture's are far from mandatory (in fact you could miss every single one and nobody would notice) but it's helpful to attend and his lecturing is engaging. The workload wasn't TOO much  but it definitely wasn't a breeze either. MC was tricky but luckily he reformatted the final quiz to only one essay!
3.5,Attendance is not necessary. Going to recitation will probably be enough for the quizzes. Multiple Choice Questions can be very tricky so beware. Be nice to your TA  she/he will boost your mark.
4,He reminds me of Dr. House. Expert in his field and very knowledgeable and engaging in class. Difficult for me  though  to figure out what he wants on some assignments (I've gotten everything from a B- to an A+  so I'm a bit confused because I don't feel like I did anything different ) but he's a good professor. Lots of reading!
3,Took his intro class and when he offered Business of Media  I jumped to take another class he taught... even though it was 930am on a FRIDAY. He's an amazing teacher and really supportive if you reach out to him. Didn't need to use the text book much and he was a pretty easy grader if you generally participated and did your Blog entries.
4,This is a larger class that feels small because Ted allows students to take control of their own learning. He brings in great speakers from his contacts and the blogs & long-form sector analysis projects are useful to show future employers.
4,Attendance not taken at lecture but necessary to attend to include lecture notes in essays. Multiple choice q's can be tricky. Class was quite enjoyable overall.
1.5,Thank goodness for his TA who didn't mark the papers very hard. Dr.Hynes knows a lot  but he didn't teach clearly. The lectures weren't structured  impossible to take notes. Not the hardest prof on planet earth  but nothing special.
3,"Hmm... he was alright. Knows a lot about what he's talking about and the topics were interesting  but no good notes provided at all and way too much time spent on ""how to write"" an essay as opposed to the actual course material. I learned most from the textbooks and got away with skipping class. He yells at the class sometimes for stupid reasons"
4.5,WAY too man unfair ratings. He is kind  helpful  knowledgeable  and a great person.
2.5,Darren Hynes  although whilst not always the most organized  is very passionate about the material he teaches and is always willing to help his students. Worth taking a class or two with him!
3.5,Dr. Hynes is a nice professor but his classes seem unprepared and disorganized. However  he is very clear and sets his expectations. The material is not hard but some of it has to be self-taught. This class would have been much more engaging if he prepared his lectures but overall it is not a difficult course and is very interesting.
2,Hard to make history of witchcraft uninteresting  but this prof does not seem to even know what he's talking about half the time. He does not respond to students questions effectively and does not prepare lectures well. He usually just ends up reading out of a book  or showing us useless movie clips. Easy to get extensions on papers though.
3,He's a nice guy  but his lectures aren't much beyond average. If you have an interest in the subject he can be a really helpful guy  but to the uninitiated his lectures seem a bit dull.
2.5,A really nice guy but awful at lecturing! He could put you to sleep  his lectures were unorganized and didn't make sense  didn't help with the assignments/tests. Way to much reading  and dead boring texts. Not clear on what exams were based on  his notes never make sense. Fair marker  dead boring  but kind and lenient.
4,I found Dr. Hynes very helpful. He had a thorough knowledge of the course material and wasn't an overly hard marker. He tended to lean towards the philosophical side of 17th C European history which isn't my area of interest but it wasn't too difficult. He could stand to be a bit more exciting but I found him to be a really good prof.
1.5,Pretty useless. Enjoys walking around the class and rambling. He doesn't do the actual marking  but his teaching assistant marks fairly (Though slowly). Doesn't give notes  and it's hard to tell what you should write down since he includes so much irrelevant content in his lectures. Take Philosophy 1200 with Flynn instead if you want
1,If you are intreseted in history take another class. Spent most of the time talking about essays and very little on actual subject. No structure to lectures  impossible to take notes.
1.5,well i dont have much to say about this guy but i will say hes a easy marker but u have to study on your own cuz he doesnt give notes or slides but its ok course if u dont know nothing about philsophy then stay away or at least away from him
1.5,Darren Hynes is a horrible prof. He makes going to class useless because he just stands up front and rambles incoherently. Theres no notes or structure and when asked to explain something he does so by responding with something else that you cannot understnad. If you have to take this course  do so with a different prof!
3,I found this prof great. Very laid back and engages the class in his discussions  eager to hear students thoughts (especially in the area of morals and ethics) He is a fair marker and very approachable. To be honest I barely made it to class  but had interest in the material and came out with an 80 in the course.
1.5,Clearly out of his element with History. No notes were given  books(no text)were used often but gave little idea of all aspects in the course. 2 papers 15 term definition midterm  and a cheat sheet for the final that included 15 definition terms and 2 essay questions. His TA was the only reason I did so well in this course  he was useless.
2,Though a highly intelligent man with a kind heart  Darren is far from a great teacher. His lectures are unengaging and often straight from the textbook  and he gives poor guidance on assignments. He does leave excellent feedback on papers  but the fact remains that he simply cannot communicate the material he's meant to be teaching.
2.5,I was a tad bit disappointed in this course. He is all over the place with his work which gets a bit tedious. Though he is a nice guy and an easy marker I can't help but think that it is not his class to teach.
3.5,I found Darren Hynes to be very approachable  knowledgeable  and efficient overall. I will admit that I was bored in his lectures and found that he did little to make the course interesting  but he marked students fairly and simply took all of the material straight from the book. He wasn't my favourite  but his course was relatively romper.
3,Although very unclear  he's a great prof. His lectures go all over the place  but he relies on the texts  so if you bring those to class you'll understand his lectures. He's willing to help and wants people to do well in his class. He has a great knowledge of the subject matter  but can be a little vague about what he wants in assignments.
3.5,Dr. Hynes is approachable and is extremely knowledgeable in his field. His lectures can be funny but are usually dry  however  I found him to be a little too laid back and even vague at times. I found his course to be neither good nor bad  mediocre.
5,This was my first MCC class I took and I loved every second. She is the nicest person and always listens to what you have to say. She is extremely clear and knowledgeable of the subject. There is a lot of work but the essays are fun topics and if you do the work you should be fine!
4.5,Professor Sussman is my favorite instructor at NYU thus far. I was nervous at first because I don't like speaking out in class  but she makes everyone feel comfortable and I feel like I have learned immense amounts in this course. She is always friendly and although she gives a lot of work it is worth it especially if you plan on being an MCC major
5,Best professor I've had thus far. hands down. She genuinely cares about her students  and is an overall awesome person. The class is very discussion based so it's very lively and student driven. All of the things she expects you to know are in her presentations  so  honestly  there's no NEED to read the stuff she assigns but most is cool. TAKE HER!
4,The discussion setup of HumanComm makes the class. A fair teacher  always wants to hear what every student has to say and will NEVER shut anyone down. Extremely nice and the class is fairly easy if you do your work. A lot of reading  and a few papers/tests over the semester. Readings are helpful  but only sometimes necessary around half the time.
2.5,She gives the most work out of all the other professors who teach the same course.
4,I had Prof. Sussman for Intro. to Media Criticism. Her classes are very interesting and she knows what she's talking about. It's really easy to get a good grade in the class as long as you listen to what she has to say. The tests are a lot of writing  but she prepares you really well.

1,Doesnt understand students nowadays  he expects too much. He gave us our first exam the end of October and expected us to do well on 7 chapters of studying.
4.5,Tough but fair and willing to help but you gotta ask.
5,Dr. Wiseman is an awesome professor. He expects students to work for their marks (which is the way it should be!) He uses great examples and has a great sense of humor. I would definitely take more courses with him. He is passionate about the topic and makes it easy to attend class. Overall I would rate him an A+ Professor.
5,1st year classes are easy  upper year classes require a lot more investment in time. A great guy and prof. I went through some tough times and he helped me out more than most. He knows his stuff cold.
4.5,marks easy in first year courses but in second and third year such as cart and geomorph he expects a great deal more although if you go to class and study high marks are quite possible
3,Wiseman seems to really know what he's talking about. He's always willing to help  even if he seems a bit aloof. Only complaint is that he has a tendency to assume his students know the materials as well as he does. Good attendance is reccommended - but his tests are never very difficult.
3.5,He is a good prof who tries to ensure he is making each point with clear. He is hard to approach however  as he always seems busy. Make sure you have questions prepared prior to speaking to him  or he'll treat you like your stupid!
1,Dr. Wiseman is very strict and has no patience for students that have families. He does not make try and meet the needs of a student that is going through a hard time. And also as well  he does not narrow down what to study before an exam.
4.5,Super class. Nice guy  helpful  easy to understand.
4.5,expectations are too high but he marks easy and is fair
4,He has high expectations for his students but this only helps you to learn how to do it the right way. Once you get through his first years class  his other classes are a breeze  he just likes to weed out the dumb people
4,He's a really cool prof. He's young and has kids  so he knows what it's like to have a life outside of classes. The textbook is useful  but most of the testing materials come from the lectures. He also tells you what is going to be on each test  which are not cumulative.
5,"Every moment spent in his classes was like staring directly into the face of god  and having him stare back and say ""You are my most wonderous creation""."
3.5,"STOP TALKING WHILE I""M WRITING... I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU JUST SAID BECAUSE I AM TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING FROM THE PROJECTOR... Great teacher I must say but geez man you'd better have a good outline for what you are SPECIFICALLY looking for on the exam... Unless you give us a day to write it...I'll name my next pet fish after you."
3,Smart man  only if he knew this is not a 4th year course. I give him an A on what he knows and a Z for thinking that we'll know as much as he does at the end of the course. Your Laptop is garbage. I sit there wishing he would just ease on his marking right vs wrong (people get nervous too man. You're not that cool.
3,Chauvinistic  favoritism can be a problem. A good guy once he gets to know you.
2,There is no help here when needed  he's cocky and you are never right....
3,Easy to understand but....could anyone be more cocky?
4.5,get past the rough exterior and a great prof shines through
4.5,Knows his stuff and will prove it.
4.5,If you are interested in successful professional and academic work in the not-so-distant future  this is a realistic professor to take a class with. You can decide how much you can read and handle from an assignment standpoint. Professor Collins is an excellent teacher who challenges her students to be the best they can be. You can't ask for more.
4,Beautiful woman. She will challenge your mind until you ache from thinking  but she is a genuine  interesting  and brilliant scholar. She treats you like an adult  meaning she is totally on your level  but expects nothing less than professional work and vigorous discussion. She is amazing  and I'm really disappointed that NYU is losing her!
5,I had Sue for Language  Thought and Culture. It was at 9:30 in the morning and her great energy made it a lot of fun! The class literally changed the way I view the world  and culture's role in absolutely everything. It also was why I decided to go abroad.
1,I regret not dropping this class from the start. There is just so much reading for this class it's almost unbelievable. She's a really nice lady but I physically cannot keep up with the readings. Stay away if possible
4.5,Although she may be intimidating  I can honestly say I learned more from her than any other professor. If you're lazy then search elsewhere. Sue is a lively force  she pushes you to produce your best work  and gives you the education every student should hope for. Definitely a professor dedicated to her students and their educational well being.
5,I have never been so simultaneously entertained and intellectually stimulated by a professor until I took Media Crit taught by Sue Collins. Sure  the class was challenging but never painful
4.5,I don't know what NYU students who complain about the difficulty of a given class expect from their education. It's one thing to recognize a challenge but quite another to characterize such rigor as a shortcoming of the professor. Sue Collins is an excellent prof. who fairly challenges her students. Lazy individuals-please spare us your thoughts!
2.5,I had to drop this class. She assigned literally three times more reading than the other professors for the same class. Also  there is an incomprehensive quiz at the beginning of the class which asks random and trick quesitons. Almost half of the original class was gone within the first three classes.
4,Collins taught two of my core classes (Ad and Soc./Media Crit.) and was enthusiastic and extremely knowledgeable of the subject in both
5,Sue is probably the best professor Ixe2x80x99ve had. Ixe2x80x99ve probably gained more from her classes than from any other. Her enthusiasm about teaching was present in every single class. I canxe2x80x99t imagine people not liking her classesxe2x80xa6 unless they donxe2x80x99t want to do the work and learn. I only wish all of my professors cared as much as she did.
1.5,If you will take this class you will feel as you are in the militery.
2.5,No Comments
1,1. Her assignments and teaching styles were very unfocused. 2. While the reading was interesting  the discussions following lacked insight and direction. 3. She refused to entertain viewpoints other than her own rigid ones  which greatly inhibited the ability to learn.
4.5,No Comments
3.5,Sue was a fun prof to have although the class was a bit vague and it was sometimes hard to tell what she wanted. She was willing to help  but sometimes stuff still didn't make sense. Overall not a hard class for me  but it was for some people.
3.5,Sue is a very nice person but sometimes it feels as if the only right way is her way. She can definitely be a very hard Prof. and she makes you work. Although  she puts a lot of emphasis on class participation which is nice.
3.5,No Comments
5,This class is pretty challenging. Consists of 1 group project completed in class  2 tests  and many homework assignments. Chen is a great professor but the topic is hard to grasp. You must put effort and time in this class to do well. Show up to class  read chapters  and ask questions and you should do okay. Confusing class but it is manageable.
4,This class is really hard if you let it be. You just have to pay attention in class  do all the homework and class activities  get C's on the tests and you will do fine. Dr. Chen is a cool lady and really relaxed. She teaches really boring classes but does her best to help you learn the material.
5,She is a great professor that will go out of her way to help you. Class is interesting  however  there are some concepts that are hard to grasp. There really isn't much homework at all  other than reading the chapters from the book. There are 3 quizzes and a final  but the final is just questions from the 3 quizzes. Read  Go to class and take notes
4,A really great professor  she knows her stuff. You need to pay attention in class and seek help outside of class or you will fail the exams. Midterm and finals were both hands on. Final project used concepts from the entire semester. The textbook is only used for studying so if you can borrow someones do that. Attendance is mandatory.
4,The class is really tough due to lack of introductory material. It jumps you right into the nitty gritty. Her tests are really hard but if you do well on the assignments and projects you are sure to get at least a B
5,"I have had the honor of knowing Dr. Chen. She has been my professor/advisor throughout college. She is one of the nicest most caring professors i've ever had. She truly cares about each student and for their success. She gives great homework feedback and is always willing to help. We all call her our ""mom"" at school. Great professor!!!!"
4,Dr. Chen is an excellent professor! She cares deeply about the success of her students and she is always willing to help. Pay attention during her lectures  take notes  and ask questions. She is the best professor I have had a Ball State.
3.5,Most instruction takes place with videos and through practical applications. She is always quick to respond to questions and willing to help.
5,She is a good teacher and the material in book are helpful for exam. I think it is not a difficult class to pass if you do homework carefully.
4.5,She's deffinatly my favorite ISOM professor. She gets students engaged in class and connects with you one-on-one. Available for help and if you don't understand something  ask and she'll clear things up and bring it to a level thats relatable to you. You have to work for a good grade. Loved the class though.
2.5,She thinks she's a good professor but her lectures are utterly pointless. She's confusing and goes off on tangents that are irrelevant to the class material. I would probably look for a different professor in retrospect because  although I received an A  it was a stressful 100 level class and I learned nothing.
1,Tests are almost impossible  her grading is extreme  and so hard to understand. Avoid at all costs!
1,Horrible! Avoid at all costs! Her tests are impossible and this class is very intense for a 100 level class
5,Easily the best ISOM professor. I too have had her for 4 semesters straight  and her classes have been extremely rewarding. She's serious in course work  so expect to work hard for your grade while building useful skills for your first job. She goes out of her way to make sure you succeed
5,One of hardest working professors at Ball State. Always very helpful with questions you may have  and grades assignments very fast. She makes an active effort to get her students interested in IS and the course. Always responds to emails very quickly. Attendance is mandatory  but every student should have her as a prof before graduation.
5,Great professor you get to know in the ISOM program. Takes a vested interest in students  and makes a huge effort to assist in any way possible. Labs were engaging and better than powerpoint lectures. Stay on her good side and get to know her  i've had her 4 times now for my Info Sys major. She is very knowledgeable  and a great professor to take.
4.5,Dr. Chen is great. She really tries to help you understand this material. She's also available outside of class for extra help. Her tests can be complicated  but if you study  you'll be fine. She's a great prof and I'm looking forward to future classes with her.
4,Professor Chen generally knows what she is talking about  but sometimes she is learning how to use programs as you are
5,very knowledgeable of the material and extremely helpful. She will go out of her way to make sure that you succeed in her class.
5,I had her and loved her. She was so nice and helpful that it made the class interesting. It's a lot of common sense  but you still have to do all the work and study to do well. Just stay on top of things and you should come out of Chen's class with an A!
1,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS YOU WILL HATE YOUR LIFE AND CONTEMPLATE DROPPING OUT OF COLLEGE
1,Literally so unclear  grades papers harshly  don't take his class. You're going to regret your life if you take his class.
1,It's obvious that Moran is very intelligent in this field  but this is  by far  the worst class that I have taken at NYU. He makes you write three 10 page papers that are worth 75% of your grade and participation is worth 25%. It is basically impossible to get an A. He leaves rude comments that make you feel horrible. Terrible teacher and class.
1,Please  for the love of God  do not take this man. He is rude  comes up with outlandish course guidelines  and is extremely condescending. Don't expect nice comments or constructive feedback
1,"He is by far the worst professor I had at NYU. He does not elaborate on what he actually wants to see on the paper and if you don't follow the ""protocol""  you won't get anything higher than a B or C. I went to see him outside of class for the second paper  and everything he told me to put on the paper was ""wrong"" when he returned it."
1,Worst professor I had at NYU by far. He's always confused in class. Papers are absolute nightmares. Based on his crazy model  they have no thesis and cause you to repeat yourself incessantly  and then come to no conclusion. His markings are very rude and his grading harsh. Impossible to meet with and gives 5 days to write 10 page papers. 100% awful
1.5,Five weeks into the semester and I've never regretted taking a class more. The comments he leaves on ungraded homework assignments are hurtful and upsetting
2.5,Lectures are a complete waste of time. Unfortunately he takes attendance so you have to go or get someone to sign you in. Quize's are easy if you study and have a good TA. The key to enjoying this class is having a good TA. That being said  professor Moran is sweet and very understanding. I recommend you take him  you learn a lot.
1,Moran is the WORST professor I have ever had at NYU. Extremely unreasonable grading and no clear direction was provided. Unreasonable grader  uninteresting class  uninsightful marker  rude human being  and just a pain to be around. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS  EVER. You have been warned.
5,I genuinely loved Moran's class. Very insightful. He had a lot to share in great material and also personal experience. Highly recommended.
1.5,I am a senior at NYU  and he remains the worst teacher I have EVER had at NYU. Horrible. Avoid at all costs. History of Media and Comm with Moran is a class that makes the quality of education at NYU look pathetic.
2,Worst teacher I have had at NYU. Ridiculous paper guidelines and horrible grading tactics. The point of this class is not to LEARN  the point of this class is to try to guess what he wants you to write  and write about that. You are required to attend class and my grade was actually dropped a grade because I missed two classes more than allotted.
2.5,Paper's are silly: ridiculous structure  not cohesive  and fails to resemble an academic paper. Follow his instructions  and avoid using any original thought or creative exploration. His lectures are repetitive and antidotal  and often don't adress the subject. No possibility of a shared learning experience  because he already knows everything...
4,had him for history of comm. last semester. work load wasn't hard but was tedious. had to write essays on every few chapters of his book. for lectures he basically recited his book that HE wrote so no one went to class. easy grade!
4,PROFESSOR MORAN IS THE MOST ADORABLE MAN. HE IS EXTREMELY HELPFUL AND DOWN TO EARTH. FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS TO HIS ESSAYS PERFECTLY AND YOU WILL GET AN EASY A. HE IS NOT LOOKING TO TRICK ANYONE  JUST TRYING TO GET YOU TO FOLLOW HIS LECTURES. IF YOU SHOW UP TO CLASS  YOU MIGHT ALSO MAKE A LETTER GRADE DIFFERENCE. HE RESPECTS STUDENTS WHO RESPECT HIM.
2,His lectures may be entertaining because he is so knowledgeable and incorporates many anecdotes  but I have not had good experiences with him in person. He has been extremely rude to me and I have witnessed him be rude to other students. It ruined my experience to say the least
4,didn't really have a book or lessons plan...mostly anecdotal lectures. not really any work to do besides one final  long paper
3.5,Mostly irrelevant anecdotal lectures  but overall a nice guy. Weird essay assignments  but easy once you get the hang of them. The way I found was to number the questions 1-18 and then write the numbers in the book by info that will be helpful in answering that question  b/c then your essay is mostly quotes.
4.5,I had him for History of Comm and he was so knowledgeable. His essays are really particular  but as long as you follow directions you'll get a good grade. What he talks about in lectures is good info for his essays. Overall a fairly interesting class.
5,I had Terry for Mass Persuasion and Propaganda and absolutely loved him and the class. I definitely recommend it!
5,This man is a genius. He was by far the best professor I had at Western. His lectures were insightful  meticulous  and often times hilarious. Best of all  he tactfully and efficiently poke fun of idiots (i.e. his grammar lectures after an essay test!).
4.5,Great lecturer (if you can get past uhm's and ah's:)  provides good in-depth examples and great summaries (you can study for tests from them!)  and is always available to help. He expects you to read the material prior to class and loves relevant questions. Read  come to lectures (daily!) and you'll get an easy A.
1,I counted the number of uh's and um's and there were 55 in 5 minutes. I found I was so distracted by his speech impediment that I couldn't focus on the words in between the uh's. He's a stubborn old man who grades unfairly. His tests are long and hard. The reading was difficult to keep up with as well. This class was a GPA killer.
4,Knows his stuff  and expects you too as well. He called out some kid in class because the kid made a dumb comment. I like that. Lots of reading. Tests are hard. Going to class is essential. Don't use pencils.
2.5,Long lecture  feels even longer because of his lecturing style. Difficult to understand his lecture  but plentiful class notes make up for it. Difficult to prepare for the examines  since there is no study guide whatsoever. Too much reading  and even the reading materials are boring. He even changed the exam format a week before the Final.
3.5,It was difficult to stay awake during the lectures and pay attention. I the reading tended to be more interesting than class. The information is interested but Stoever doesn't deliver it well (to say the least). Not a hard class but I wouldn't recommend it.
2.5,Very boring  likes to walk as he talks and his facial expessions are histerical. Good info but hard to hear what he says.
1,This was the most boring class I have ever taken at Western. I got the worst grade in this class I have ever gotten in college. He has an interesting sense of humor  but I think he is rude  and it is very impossible to follow his lectures without falling asleep because is voice is monotone. I couldn't go to class without falling asleep.. STAY AWAY!
4.5,"One of my favorite profs. Has a very dry  sophisticated sense of humor  an awesome lecturer. Each hour is well planned  and information efficiently delivered. He does make some funny grammar comments when handing tests back:anything else. ""The Brahmin priest offers a sacrifice on the ALTAR. The vet ALTERS the puppy dog."" It's all in good fun."
2,Most boring professor I have ever had. Very monotonous  very difficult to follow at times. Assigned too much reading for full-time students.
3.5,Interesting but the reading is very dry. Prof. is very particular about grammer and spelling on essay tests. He is a little dry but the material is interesting.
5,He is a brilliant man. One of the best lectures I have had. Very concise. Take a lot of notes. Very interesting. If you do most of the reading and have an understanding of the basic concepts you will do fine.
5,Stoever is overflowing with knowledge and he has that sketchy genius personality that I dig in a prof. Probably one of the most influential professors I've had to date.
4,Finally a professor who made me feel like I was in college! I loved Stoever and the class. He's incredibly intelligent and has a a pretty funny sense of humor that you have to kind of catch. Take really good notes  study hard and watch your grammar on the exams and you'll do great. Highly recommende
4,Smartest. Prof. Ever. He and Dr. Stoops are literally the smartest people I have ever met. All his classes are great  be sure to take VERY good notes. People claim he's hard  but he really just doesn't take crap from dumb people. Great experience  highly reccommended!
3.5,Very hard material! Very knowledgable
4.5,Brilliant  has a sense of humor  you get exactly what you put into it. Work hard and it'll be one of the best classes you'll take.
4,Dr. Stoever is the best professor I've ever had at Western. He is brilliant  interesting  and truly passionate about the subject. I recommend him to everyone. He is  however  very  very tough. Don't take this class if you aren't prepared to read and listen. LOTS. But it's totally worth it.
3,Oh my god a professor that actually challenges his students more than a high school teacher and covers the material in depth as fits the job ... lets all get online and write bad reviews because somebody assumed that we were actually intelligent enough to handle being taught like adults.
3,Lectures are interesting  but not always clear. The reading load and tests are very reasonable. It is important to read the material for clarification. He also pays close attention to grammar and spelling on tests.
5,Paul was the voice that I needed when I was just coming into my own as an artist and photographer. He made me concentrate on mediums outside of my comfort zone and was critical but encouraging. I wouldn't' be where I am without him.
3.5,im a little sad to see so few reviews for sparks  he is great  alot of people hate him  with good reason  hes an antagonizer  he has no idea how to do anything other than make you feel something  hes not a teacher hes a old man sharing all that he knows  and it may or not be alot  but he gets under skin better than a sliver  he does name drop  he d
5,Definitely the best professor I had while attending Evergreen and art school. Incredibly helpful and knowledgeable about the art world and a fun professor. I feel he really helped my work grow and pushed me. As a woman  I didn't find him to be anti feminist/woman at all. His retirement is a HUGE loss to the evergreen students.
1.5,Picks favorites  biased  made creepy jokes around me when I was alone with him(I'm a girl)  uses the same slides for lectures over & over. I didn't like him at all.
1,He's a name dropper. What more do I have to say? Anyone who takes his advice to heart is a fool.
2.5,Paul picks favorites. Paul has his own agenda. Paul has his own agenda for what you should do with yourself. Be careful  especially if you end up being a favorite. Some say he lives vicariously through the work of his students. All I'm gonna say is that he has an agenda - for you and for your work.
5,don't take his class if you're a ****  not if you're a woman! why not transcend to substance? he's not out to judge anyone personally. Art CAN be****ty. not just because it's got no talent. personal working process & style has to been CRITICIZED to improve. self-involved catharcism is why no one gives a**** about art. we have to take drastic steps towards art that actually ROCKS. Paul has crystalized this vision that may never be seen again if it's been seen before. prof's don't come this UNstuffy.
1.5,He's a horrible lecturer and a poor class planner  but he?s honest when it comes to the art world outside the classroom. His teaching style isn't anti-woman  but definitely anti-feminist.
4.5,Overall good guy and fun to talk to. However  his art knowledge is primarily based in the late 70's/80's and says all art is cyclical and therefor has no need to go to see any new art because he has already seen something like it 20 years ago. He claims to retire every year for the last 10 yrs and it shows so get it over with and hire FRESH.
5,Amazing teacher. Really liked him. Brilliant artistically. Highly recommended him. A treasure.
4,Paul is very knowledgeable and very reasonable. He wants you to participate in your own education. I am a woman and I had no problem with him.

1,Stay away if you're a woman!
5,Paul is old-school Evergreen and close to retirement. Take his class before he's gone! He's practical and no-nonsense and has a great sense of humor. He also happens to know many of the prominent American photographers from the last 50 years.
4,Dr. B is pretty legit. He's super easy going. and there is no possible way to fail his class. People have legit sat in class and listened to music during his lectures and still make A's on tests.
3.5,Very kind and approachable! Never made me feel uncomfortable because I'm not a music major!
3,He is a mellow guy  never had a prob. with him  very easy style of teaching
5,No Comments
5,The BEST!
3,Very nice guy  his class is just made up of attendance and take home quizzes that are 50-60 questions for each chapter. Just do the quizzes during the lecture and show up very very very easy A
3,This class is the easiest i have ever taken. He is a little boring and rambules a lot. But he gives all take home quizes and all the questions for the mid-term and final are from the quizes.He is a sweet older guy.
1.5,Horrible. I can't stand sitting through his pointless lectures that don't even pertain to the material being covered. He mumbles on and on and he gives out too many take home quizes that are extremely time consuming.
3,When i took him last semester he was cool.. this semester is differnt. He isnt very helpful anymore bcuz people took advantage of him. Im a strait A student and i failed the midterm bcuz He wont help on the chapters any more  which sucks! he does give extra credit though. beware: he changes! dont know what he will be like next semester..
2,Very slow and rambles on about things that don't pertain to the lesson. Boring is the word.
3.5,He does babble on in class about useless info(his kids and grandkids)lol..but hes an awesome guy. you have to maintain a A complete all assignments and not miss more than the amount of absences and you dont have to take the final!it was a huge stess relief at exam week.but just in case u do have to take the exam  refer to your quiz book and u'll b
4,Quiz book needs revision. Lots of work but very easy.
2,If you have to give the class a revised textbook  how about a revised quizbook? Cons: BORING  opinionated  mumbling  subject-changing.Pros: very knowlegable  nice guy.
2.5,An extremely easy A. If you don't mind listening to the ramblings of an older prof  whose lectures are too much useless opinion and not enough substance.
1.5,very easy A. hes not to good of a teacher  but if youre looking for an easy A  that is the teacher for you.
3,He lectured on alot of history around the 50's. He never covered much material after that although we still had to take quizzes on it. A nice person but became mundane after a while.
4,As an older professor  he has good insights in the history classes. He's very flexible and the assignment are very easy. Take this course to get a pretty easy A.
4,I had Mr. Matthews and I thought he was very nice and his class was easy. Anyone looking for a easy A  take this class
2.5,Stop giving your own opinion on every single topic and let the class interact every once in a while.
5,Best Bio Professor EVER. He gives great feedback everyone should take his classes I know I will continue to take his classes
2,If you have to take this class please do not take it with this teacher because he is extremely hard. I took him for BASIC bio and I'm currently taken his anatomy class on line and man does he make the questions HARD to find. I passed his bio class with an 2.0 and now I'm trying to pass his anatomy class on line with at least an 3.0. Don't take him.
1.5,Is a very dull instructor. Has practice questions on blackboard which are actually on the tests. Lets you use a 3x5 card with notes for each test which helps alot. Most of the questions come from lecture notes (also on blackboard) I would not recommend him unless you have no choice. he does take attendance via sign in sheet.
2,He's really nice. The class is easy  but make sure you study from the book.
2.5,I would not recommend this teacher to my worse enemy.He is very boring and to me he does not know what he is talking about.If you ask for help he tells you that he went over it already and that the notes were on the board.He will totally put you to sleep.If you have to take this class please do not take this guy.
1.5,I am sure he is a nice guy  BUT he does not know how to teach. He graded one of our lab tests and then I noticed that he had graded unfairly on my test. That was the beginning of him being on my bad side. He is NOT prepared whatsoever! He would say something and then do another. Do not hold him to his word. Drop his course/do not take it from him!
2,Doesnt really seem to know what hes talking about. He is very nice but the class is unorganized. You never know what the test is going to be like. You don't even know what to study. You never use the book and he gets off topic and starts talking about his life frequently.
3.5,I took his health class online. IT IS SO EASY & pretty interesting too. You DO need the book to answer the bi-weekly quizzes/tests  which are easy  only a couple of questions  and open book! U dont need to read the book
3.5,He really does know what he's talking about  and he's a really nice guy  but he doesn't really know how to teach. he goes through a lot of slide shows that pretty much copy paste what the book says. You must work hard in this class because you don't get too much from the lectures  it's just too boring. Don't take him if you're not interested.
2.5,"Took 7 week summer class with Jerry. Nice man just goes on very long tangents. We didn't do over half the labs and never had a lab quiz. Attendance and ""labs"" were worth 40% of our grade so you pretty much had to attend. Very easy 4.0 but did not feel I got my moneys worth."
4.5,I took him for an online class and didn't have any issues. There is a lot of reading assignments but the class was interesting and kept me focused. Assignments were pretty straight-forward except for the diet log which some of the instructions were a little unclear. He is a fair teacher and made my first online class a breeze!
4.5,A really decent professor  not too dynamic but very fair and friendly  easy to get along with.
4,He gets off track from time to time but otherwise is interesting. He certainly is not a bad teacher and you will learn something from his class.
5,All you haters must have been morons! Rogers is the best science dept. teacher there is! I enjoyed coming to class and learning  the enviornment is laid back and everyone is friendly  and participates along with the teacher! I learned the most from this class  don't believe the negative comments!
4,Aww  I read some negative feedback about Mr. Rogers  but it's not true. He's a good teacher  and kinda lets things slide. Just don't smoke around him  because he says smoking DESTROYS cilia  but we ALL know it paralyzes it..... Keep up the good work. He is good teacher.
4.5,i didn't think much of him  when i first started classes  but he's AWESOME!!!! if you EVER have a question  or are a bit behind  he helps!!! Give him a chance      your education dollars are well spent
1,"If you are looking for a class where you learn nothing and everybody fails then this class is for you. The longest I've managed to stay awake was to count how many times he said ""um"" He avereage 30 ums per 5 mins. But it'sa good class for insomniacs..Smells funny like a old shoe."
1,DROP!! He never gets to the point. He never knows what he's teaching. He fails EVERYONE!!! You teach yourself the work and besides he does not write his test or grade them. So he does not teach you whats on the test. Good class to skip and sleep threw!!
1.5,Boring! He rambles without ever getting to the point. His tests seem to be difficult  but it might be because he never gets to the point. Don't recommend him unless you need to catch up on some sleep.
1,he didnt even know what he was doing. us students helped him too much. its good he is only part time  but he shouldnt even be a teacher. i did get a 3.9. He didnt even take attendance  and i didnt even go to lab.
5,Worked with her on contract and found her to be extremely knowledgable. She opened my eyes to the atrocities happening in todays world and helped me find new ways to reach my students. She is a wonderful woman and a joy to work with.
2.5,Really good for an introduction to ME studies. Weak as far as covering different sides of an argument  but does use a broad arrangement of texts.
3.5,Unfortunately she is just not qualified to teach about the Middle East. Rather than providing students with knowledge they need to engage and combat the paradigms in question  she attempts to train them as activists. Perhaps this is because her knowledge base is in English Literature  and is seriously lacking in history and politics of the region.
5,awesome
4.5,Therese deals in the study of marginalized voices--the views and experiences NOT heard in popular education. I think she is amazing and one of the best professors I've ever had. She was always encouraging  never dominated in seminar  and has vast knowledge of feminist studies and the Middle East. She is awesome.
3.5,No Comments
4.5,Therese is a hard professor who expects a lot from her students  but is fair and supportive. Her lectures are well organized  engaging  and intelligent. She's a brillant woman who knows what she's teaching. She gives a lot of feed back on papers with helpful comments. I urge anyone to take a class from Therese before they graduate.
5,"Therese is the best! I highly recommend her to everyone. As far as her being ""biased"" towards Palestinians  she presents a balanced view of middle eastern issues often exploring elements our traditional media ignores. She is not the easiest  but you will learn alot from her if you open your mind and think critically about the material presented."
5,People say she is biased towards Palestinians  but are you kidding me? Thank goodness  cause I don't see a lot of folks pulling for Palestine in the U.S.r In other regards she's a valient professor who keeps and open mind towards other views.
2.5,Exteremly biased against Israel. Even though she claims to keep an open mind  she presented one side of the struggle in the middle east  and provided little voice for the other side to make its case. This class does not present a fair academic look at this complicated situation.
3,"Her middle eastern studies class was slanted towards Palestinians  but not by very far. It's not nearly as bad as the slant towards Israel that you see on the news every day. She assigned a book a week for a 4 credit 5 week class. The ""Roots of Terrorism"" class should've been called ""Roots of Arab Terrorism"" because that's all we covered. It was basically a modern history class. Oh  and we watched really informative and entertaining videos."
3.5,She is very passionate and involved with her subject - she will help direct you towards your own passion within the subject of Middle East Women's Studies.
5,No Comments
1.5,She promised a tough academic environment  but lost many students' papers and let seminar turn into personal stories. I asked if we could talk about the books she said I was being argumentative and I should keep my opinions to myself. My classmates exhibited more maturity than she did.
5,Super awesome at everything concerning literature  feminism or the Middle East. Great at explaining assignments in multiple ways if you hare having trouble understanding what she is looking for. Excellent feedback on all writing. All around great!
5,Therese is the best professor I've had at Evergreen. She is very knowledgeable and well-read  but not arrogant. She is great at running Seminars  which is so important at TESC. I hope I can take more credits from her in the future.
4.5,I like how she asks for feedback during the course.
1,Condescending. Her way or the highway.
1.5,do your readings or suffer her wrath
2.5,If you want to be preached to  take her env. course.

5,Nice guy and laid back. All tests are take home and there is homework due weekly. Offers extra credit. Just go to class and get an A. Don't buy the book.
5,Great teacher.
4,He is not hard...come on!!! compare to other teachers....he test are easy...in addition to it you have homework which helps you increase your grade (easy points).....Also tells you what to study from the test.....trust me if you do your homework you will be allright....I had a B....
2.5,Thick accent  hard to understand but straight forward  follows the book. His tests are not very hard and he is very liberal with his grading.
2.5,"He follows the text book and refers to many of the diagrams (he calls them ""examples""). Most classes are lecture for first half  then a computer lab  which usually involves some web browsing and answering some questions. Tests are T/F  M/C  an"
2.5,My god  what a thick Asian accent! The first day I wasn't sure if he was speaking English or something else.
5,machine learning
5,His enthusiasm for the course was infectious. Very knowledgeable and helpful. Course was very difficult.
5,Great prof. Very organized and enthusiastic. Assignments and tests were fair.
4.5,Charismatic  good communicator. Very enthusiastic. Difficult course.

1,This man is the absolute worst professor I've ever had the displeasure of interacting with. Arrogant doesn't begin to describe him. Weekly blog articles that are short essay length  vague grading rubric. He will not give you an A unless you stroke his oversized ego. Turn things in well before the due date or he will mark you down. DON'T TAKE IT
4,Has around 11 blogs and group presentations. Allows the blogs to be revised for higher grade. Grades fairly and offers extra credit. Be prepared to read a lot and participate in class discussions. Blogs make up a large % of grade.
1,Weekly blog posts are long  boring and graded very harshly. He also does not give feedback. Would not recommend to other students.
3,"I said ""So Many Papers"" because the weekly ""blog posts"" have to be minimum 750 words. Given a chance to make them up. He uses an emoji grading system on the blog posts  so I constantly had to look at the syllabus to see whether I got a 3 or 3.5 or whatever. DO THE BLOG POSTS EVERY WEEK. They are a HUGE part of your final grade. Real make or break."
3,He's tough at grading but makes it clear that he wants you to write well-written blogs that look professional/interesting and prove that you've read the texts and have thought critically about them. He's British  so his humor is rather dry and sarcastic--I loved it. Very nice as long as you are respectful.
1,Don't take. No respect for students or their opinions. Super sarcastic and rude. Reading is heavy and the only aspect of the class I enjoyed  that had nothing to do with him. He grades writing assignments in emojis: winky face + glasses is an A while frowny face + smile is a C. Upset I wasted my limited time (and money) on a course like this.
2,Dr. Burton requires his students to write weekly. A lot work if you miss class it will hurt grade even if you complete all the work. I wouldn't take him again
2,He is the worst teacher I've ever had. He is very rude and doesn't care about the students.
2.5,"Rob Burton  while a very interesting instructor who is at times thought-provoking to listen to  I will not take again. He has a very weird grading scale. Reading specific blogs  which are the primary source of our grades in this class (60%)  are graded not with letter grades or percentages  but rather ""smiley-faces"". He is also quite sarcastic."
3,The guy is a complete ass. He is rude to his students  if you come in late  need to use the bathroom or ask a question he makes a scene. But it is an easy class. He wont tell you your grade tho- you should just know it. ?
1,He grades really weird but there is enough opportunity for extra credit.
5,10 Week Summer Study Abroad class in Chiang Mai  Thailand. NOT an Easy Class  but A+ was doable by completing the reading and finishing the 3 required weekly blogs and 5 hours of community service. One of the best experiences of my life. Tony Waters Combo + Rob Burton was great. At the end of classes you will end up being saddER  but wiseER. Got A+
3.5,took this for my theme class  tons of writing and reading but hey its english. Cultural events were actually very interesting and enjoyable I did a few extras of those... class time is just book discussion and I hope the soccer book is never used again and most people in the class feel the same way (he was very upset when he found this out)
2.5,class is more like a book club  class was huge (about 100+ people). he'll call you out for talking or leaving early so dont do it (he'll actually stop class until you contribute). you learn a lot from the cultural events you attend. its hard to get into the grove of writing 2-4 pages a week in blogs because he wants them done a VERY CERTAIN WAY
4.5,great class!
4,Rob is a good teacher. I loved this class because there were very few student and we just talked about multicultural lit and pedagogical standpoints. I enjoyed most of the books and the blogs were a good medium for homework. I would take another of Rob's class.
4,This class was pointless...no more than a book club. Didn't learn a thing. Online blogs were a joke. As a teacher he was good. Not the most patient  gets a little frustrated when his point isn't getting across  but always means well. He cares about your grade and will work with you. Very helpful in office hours. I'd take him in another class.
4.5,Rob Burton has his flaws  but he'll grow on you. His class is great - he always assigns great texts  leads interesting discussions  and the use of informal blogs for homework is fun and engaging. He can be irritable from time to time but I wouldn't take it personally. He's not such a cold fish one-on-one as he seems in class. Recommended.
4.5,He's is really passionate about his job  for an english class it was a piece of cake. I would recommend it to anyone. He is VERY easy going and cares. I felt bad not going to his classes. He doesn't assign much  but when he does make sure to do the work. He expects that and WILL call you out. GREAT CLASS.
4.5,ENGL353 was one of the easiest classes I took at Chico State. For those who complain  they must have been really lazy. I skimmed chapters and wrote blogs (those are his assignments) and got an A. Rob is easy going guy and shows a lot of videos in class. Open to different opinions.
4.5,Very nice and helpful. She's very enthusiastic about microorganisms and infectious diseases. Allowed me an extension on my paper.
5,This is the best professor to take if you are not a biology major...she understands that the class is not made up of majors and presents the material a way that is easily understandable. The class is sometimes boring but attendance is not mandatory...I would highly reccommend the professor for Biology class
4.5,Shes a good teacher  but you have to study a lot to do well on the tests. shes very helpful tho and will answer questions and give extra credit.
2.5,Shes nice some of the time other times shes can be really mean and nasty  wont answer questions  degrades you if shes in a bad mood and asks if you know how to read  id advise not to ask her questions during lab but do everything possible to find the answer yourself. not bad of a grader. she knows what she is talking about
5,Really good professor-- science isn't my best subject  but I did pretty well in this class. She understands that many of her students aren't bio majors  and teaches the material in a way that's easy to understand. There are 4 tests and a final exam-- mostly multiple choice with 1 or 2 essays questions. I definitely recommend her.
5,Really nice and understanding professor!!! Go see her if you ever need any help.
4,nice professor  pretty lenient. gives extra credit. tests are pretty easy. very knowledgeable--just ask her questions.
5,Great professor. Makes subhjects as interesting as they could be  and gets the points of class along very well. She moves pretty quick  but if you can keep up its all good. Difficult class  but if you keep up with it you can get an A. Extra Credit was also offered.
2.5,Nice lady but kind of stand offish. I found that she doesnt seem to like to answer questions  she says to read the packet. Quizzes are pretty easy. Def. read the lab packet before class because she goes through the explanations pretty fast.
4.5,enjoyed her class
1.5,Horrible. She's mundane and teaches by reading directly off her powerpoints. Not to mention you can't understand her powerpoints. Does not care if students are interested in material  and does not try to make it interesting. Would not recommend!!!
4,Very good at what she does  she knows her stuff. Great course  am taking her for more classes.
1.5,"She sucks  answers all questions with ""read the book"". Subject is boring as hell already and she makes biology worse (didn't think that was possible)!"
5,good teacher
3,Very wild and hyperactive. Goes pretty quick. Nice lady  but certainly not the best bio teacher out there.
1,No Comments
4.5,Loved her! If she wasn't teaching about deadly bacteria  she could fit in just as well baking cookies. A real grandma type. There is NO SUCH THING as a 2 min. conversation w/ her. Love the powerpoints!
4.5,Very helpful  tries to make sure all students understand the material. Very willing to spend extra time and effort for extra help. Just go to class and try to participate.
4,Mancini is nice  though she seems like she's in a hurry all the time. You will learn the material  but won't necessarily have fun doing it.

2,If I wanted to be talk to like a kid id go to a day care. this woman talk to her students like we are 6 years old.
4,Very invested in her students. Will do anything to help them succeed!
1,This prof talks to you like you are a child of 7  not an adult of 19 -20. It's a joke. Haven't been in something so juvenile since 2nd grade. Insulting. Didn't learn a thing from her. Good thing students do her job for her. She doesn't seem to respect students enough to talk to them as adults. I don't pay thousands to be treated like I'm 7. Avoid.
1.5,Grades students' work against each other  NOT against a rubric. Has student groups teach subjects for her...and that's the highlight of the course. Class only covers the easiest theories that you'll learn better in other comm classes. Super easy workload. Don't think/try and you'll be fine. This course is about pleasing her  so just play her game.
5,Students actually teach the class most of the time with group presentations. Ferrante has no problem with interrupting a presentation to put in her two cents  but her comments are always helpful. Very easy class!
4.5,"Very friendly  helpful and responds to questions outside of class quickly. Complete assignments and speeches the exact way she lays out  she is sort of ""my way or the highway"" but lays out the requirements clearly. Do exactly what she says and you'll get an A or B no problem. She grades attendance and missing class causes major points off."
5,At first when attending class it seemed like it would be a ton of work. This turned out to be one of the best classes I've ever taken. She works with students and the students present on the theories in class. It's a great way to learn  we did activities and got to know everyone in the class. Honestly  one of the best professors I've ever had!
3.5,The class isn't that bad but she isn't the best professor. The whole class is having groups teach a chapter. This is fine but she interrupts a lot during presentations and doesn't let the group complete what they were saying.
1,We were supposed to learn how to write a literature review. What the difference between a research question and a hypothesis is. How to write acedemic papers at the graduate level. Instead we wrote undergrad level papers about our feelings  no instruction from her on how to find previous research  had no idea how to write a Lit Review. Epic Fail!!
3.5,Maps were a pain and graded subjectively. The essay exams and group presentations were no different. Professor is not very yielding in any manner.
3,This professor was very hard  but actually did a really good job teaching the content. At first the concept maps were a pain  but they actually were the best learning tool ever. No studying involved in this class... just homework and groupwork.
4,This class was really easy. The workload wasn't high AT ALL. I think some people are just too lazy to do a 10 minute assignment before class. She's a very easy grader  and even gives you opportunities to miss assignments without a penalty. You teach the class twice with a group and it's also easy. It doesn't take much planning at all! EASY!!!
4.5,This was one of my favorite classes that I have taken  she is a great lady and let's the class not only learn from her and the book  but from eachother and life experiences. I loved how she approached the material. I would definately take it  and whoever claims the workload is high  its a daily concept map that you get to use on the test.
4,pretty good
2.5,She puts too much of a workload on her students  and she doesn't even teach! She has groups present and teach straight from the book. Hello  who is the professor? Not to mention her grading scale is very steep  you have to be a perfectionist to get an A. You have no idea how she grades exams and what she looks for  so good luck.
4,She's a very nice and pleasant woman and easy to talk to. Her class can get a little boring at times (too many group presentations  it gets old fast) and there's daily homework assignments  but the subject was actually pretty interesting. You'd think comm. theory would be boring but it is so applicable to real life that it's interesting to study.
3.5,"The class isn't really difficult  but she assigns a lot of homework and two group presentations throughout the semester which require a lot of work. You can use your notes on tests (all essay)  but she doesn't really tell you what she's looking for so grades can be hit and miss. Her grading scale is tougher than most  an ""A"" is 95 % and above."
5,This is my favorite class I have taken ever. Prof. Ferrante's style is very different  and she requires us to give two teaching presentations. But the atmosphere of the classroom is very comfortable and the topics are interesting. I highly reccomend taking her classes.
4,I had this class years ago and i have to say she was a GREAT professor for comunications. Speeches suck and can be scary but it wasnt bad in her class. Very good learning environment she was one of my favorite teachers at UW-SP!
4.5,Solid professor. She teaches with a great deal of enthusiasm  which is great. And  she's extrememly understanding and helpful.
1,She allows you to use notes on the tests but her questions on the tests are so out of the blue. She has you read and write down questions regarding the text before almost every class and if you're thorough  it could take around two hours. Her lectures are not posted online and they mostly consist of confusing charts or pointless stock photos. WORST
4,Professor Spievak is super knowledgeable and Cognitive Psych is SO interesting. This class is definitely not for you if you dont enjoy reading articles  writing essays  or taking lecture notes without a PowerPoint. I personally did really well and liked her a lot as a person. Would take a class with her again!
4,The way she structures her class is meaningful and makes sense with the subject. You are expected to take the time to read all the materials she provides and take notes on everything. For psych majors this class is important! She is kind and funny and participating in class is easy to do and can be fun. She expects you to do the work .
5,One of the best professors I've ever had! She's definitely not easy  but you'll learn a lot if you do the work.
2.5,Dr. Spievak is a nice person  but as a professor I would never take a class with her again. Cognitive psych was a nightmare. She assigns long  dry readings for EVERY single class  and you may/may not have a quiz on every single reading or class period. No powerpoints  just speaks what you need to know. Very hard grader  never satisfied.
4,Very professional and focused on her work. Keeps students best interests at heart and pushes them beyond their comfort zone in order to better then.
5,Dr. Spievak is an outstanding instructor. She is an expert in her field. As long as you put in the work and dedication  she will ensure that you do great. She genuinely cares and your work in her class can without a doubt take you far beyond the class itself. She prepares you for grad school. Do not take  if you aren't willing to work for it!!!
2.5,I will NEVER take her EVER AGAIN. you guys say no text book is a plus  but with cognitive psychology you NEEEED a textbook and also the fact that she doesn't do actual power points with notes she expects u to read a bunch of articles. but heaven help you if you miss one day of reading. i will say she tries to make it fun as possible.
3,The reviews about this professor below regarding what type of course work is expected during this class are accurate. However  if you want to work with somebody that wishes to challenge you into becoming a better student I suggest this professor. She's tough  but she cares and if you put in the necessary effort and work hard you will see that.
1.5,Grades with check  check plus  etc. like you're in kindergarten. Very tough at grading. Too many readings. The tests/quizzes are timed and you are expected to write 5 full essays during the midterm/final. Talks too quickly. Attendance is mandatory. Quizzes at beginning and end of class. Horrible. Don't know how I passed.
1.5,"She is all over the place. Quizzes time you meet. She expects that you can write a PERFECT essay in 12 minutes (these are her quizzes). Tons of reading to do along with ""participation"" essays at the end of the class  which is timed & graded as well as the quizzes. She is extremely picky when she grades. You'll get a B- if you lucky."
5,She definitely has a way of making a room silent when she walks in. She keeps order in the class and demands respect to visitors. I enjoyed this class. Not much to it
1,I am an older student who takes her classes seriously and this was the worst class I have ever taken. Do not take unless last resort! Very hard and confusing! Barely keeping afloat!
5,She has the ability to walk into a room and bring silence. She terrifies me  but at the same time  I think she's awesome. I have no doubt she could be mean to some students  but that's because she has really high standards and expects you to work very hard to live up to them. Underneath her exterior  she actually does care about students a lot.
2.5,Well  I came into this class with a high expectation of this professor  since friends of mine really enjoyed her class. I found her extraordinarily difficult. She has you write numerous papers that have questions that are very difficult. She expects Masters level work out of a Undergraduate class. Don't take her unless you have lots of time!
2,Such a great topic with an obnoxious  arrogant and hateful lady. Come and see the way she often embarrass people in the class. She is too uptight  and the course materials has nothing to do with the course itself. Looks like what she googled off the web. I regret taking this class!
5,I should have waited till I had taken more psyc classes before because her quizzes are essay format and maybe this would help  but if go to every class  pay attention/take notes  you will do awesome and enjoy it. Of all the classes I've taken (now 8 psyc classes)  I use what I've learned here the most in school and at home. Highly recommend!
2,She talks relentlessly and cuts no slack for anyone. She doesn't like to answer questions or clarify what she means on assignments. Her tests are hard and she seems really excited about her material too bad she completely kills the fun out of it
4,Took her special topics class...she is a BRILLIANT woman and very excited about the material...as others said her class will be your life for the semester and she is tough but you will learn a lot...DO NOT take for an easy A or if you just want to skate by  if you're willing to work hard you will learn TONS
5,GREAT PROFESSOR!!! Everyone who does well in her class loves her. If you understand her style of teaching you should do well. If you are a bad notetaker you will not do well. She is excellent and I have taken 4 classes now with her and a lab each better than the first!
2,Class has both lecture and discussion. Couldn't hear him in lecutre  which was often not relevant. He often went way over on time. I'm not a class-skipper but did several times with this one  though discussion was mandatory. His paper assignment was impossible and he was little help.
4,Nice guy and very intelligent. Class can sometimes get boring but it's usually when the dumb student talk too much. Arjun is a great TA and helped me more than anyone get into a top grad school.
5,Awesome. Psych 101 made fun. Very comprehensive...really makes you want to be a psych major! Great class! Loved it loved it loved it!
3,Knows a lot  but is not very engaging in his communication of that knowledge
5,Vey interesting topic though lecture is dry. Professor is very nice and knows a lot. TA also teaches very well and is very cute
5,He is a great prof. Very helpful and Dylan also keeps him going. Lectures are boring  tests are ridiculous but not hard. His classes are all the same. Also  he reminds me of the sloth off of Ice Age.
5,awesome professor. best that i have had yet.
4,It was an interesting course and I am glad I took it. You learn alot of neat things about culture  geography and how everything interacts. It's really cool. Tests are equal yet really test your knowledge..STUDY!!
4,Interesting course and easy to follow!
5,Re: Class size. Do you seriously think it is the prof's fault that the class is so large? And for those of you who complain about his by the book style  would prefer he not touch on the books in class  but test you on it anyways? Anyways  this guy is a great prof.
1,One of the worst profs I've ever had. Lectures were a joke. Most question that he tests you with are questions that really that dont have anything to do with the concepts studied in his sellout. It seems he just wants to know if you've read it  not if you understand it. Thumbs down
3.5,The class gets extremely boring  but he can't change the material  although he could make the class more lively. He's a funny man  and I really enjoy his classes (when I haven't fallen asleep).
1,"what a horrible prof! why do you even go to class?you can learn all you need to know in his ""sell out"" and the book  his tests are posted...so you don't really need to go to class  his quizzes are dumb and are on useless crap u would usually skip over...NVR take him!!"
2,The idea of paying for classes is to have something contributed by the prof's lecture. He does not really say anything you cannot read in the well prepared reader and text  so no point of going to class aside from seeing slides. The class size was large so no discussion or questions. He's a reader.
5,HE IS AWESOME
5,All who says that he is hard should not be in university!
4.5,One of the best teachers I've ever had. I doubt I'll forget him anytime soon.
2,nice  but impossible
3,lectures tend to get boring after a lot of listening  is a lot of reading for the course  is easy class if put in the time.
3.5,Needs to organize better  funny and fairly interesting
4,not too hard  but can get boring after a while  focuses mostly on what he knows
4.5,like sitting in on family vacation slides  but his vacations insted of relatives
1.5,Wolfe's an excellent professor. He's extremely strict and the majority of his testes are extremely challenging. Take him only if you're serious about Biology!!!
1,terrible teacher.. dont recommend to anyone
2.5,He's knows his stuff
1.5,"this guy sucks. i know biology and i got a D! am currently retaking it with flores and i got an A on the first test. i recommend taking it with flores  he's straight forward. supposedly we are getting a new bio prof b/c wolfe was ""let go"""
1,Not a very good professor. Here are the high points: Lazy - often used old  outdated powerpoints. Tests - frustrating at best. I studied 15-20 hours for one  made a B
5,He's a great biology teacher. His notes are helpful if you actually study them. This is college  not highschool  so you're supposed to put in effort to get a good grade. I only went over his notes  read the chapters and did the online quizzes and made a great grade in the class. If you don't like studying or reading  i suggest you switch majors.
1,Dr. Wolfe basically read word for word from his notes. Most of the learning had to be done on your own. Attendance was mandatory....considering you are the one paying for your class it should not be up to him if you show up or not. The only person affected is you. I showed the entire semester  but it did not help me.
5,Great teacher  I don't care what anyone says. His exams are hard when you've came straight from high school where everyone is spoon-fed. They're not hard when you take a couple hours to read and understand the material (Isn't that what you're supposed to be doing anyway if you're majoring in biology?)
1,This class is very hard. The professor just makes a power point from the book and reads it to the class. The lecture is very broad and the test are very specific. I would not recommend ANYONE to take his biology class  it is worthless. To do good in the class you have to read and understand every word in the book!!!
1,The way that he teaches really does not help the students at all. The only thing that he did was make a power point of the chapter in the book  then read it off the screen. There was really no explaining of the material that actually helped. He hardly ever interacted with students either. I could have learned as much by only looking at the book
4.5,Maybe Dr. Wolfe has changed this semester  but I think he's incredibly clear in his lectures  and his test are easy as long as you study hard for them. I'm taking 18 credit hours this semester and I still managed to get a 94 on his first exam. Take him  you'll learn a lot.
4,ummm.. for the comment below this one... i think you have the wroooong teacher buddy. nice try though.
2,yeah he is hot but he is a fresh college grad. and thinks he is the stuff and thinks he knows everything and thinks we are graduate students or something...to hard and to fast
3,Worse professor I have had yet. just reads the slides if you ask for explanation only makes you more confused and than spends half class talking about mushrooms. tests are completely irrelevant to notes. don't know how he comes up with some wuestions. but he has a nice personality.
4,all these young bio students complaining about basic general bio.. haha poor kids wait til you have to take the REAL bio classes... if you cant handle it now i suggest switching majors. it doesn't get any easier and neither do the teachers
2,Not a good professor at all. Yah  it is college  but he's just ridiculous. Test are irrelevant to half the stuff he talks about in lecture. He doesn't know how to teach at all. I'd take someone else...
5,"""if this is college""...then quit ****ing about having to study you ****ing babies"
2.5,Every nerd who says this is college blah blah blah...We're talking about the teacher everyone knows college is hard so stick to the point. Wolfe isn't the best.
5,this is my third biology class with Dr. Wolfe...with an A in all three classes. i think he is an excellent teacher  very straight-forward and willing to answer any questions you have  even outside of class. of course you have to study and pay attention... welcome to the real world. this is college  not 5th grade!
1.5,Not as bad as below that was too harsh. Needs a new approch for the class though. I had a tough schedule last semester and he was my only C grade.
4.5,She reminds me of Chris Rock. Her crude humor will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what she will say next? This class is everything you wanted your tenth grade health class to be like. Very easy B if you show up. You might not like her if you are easily offended or are uber sensative.
3,Be warned  Hartos has some very crude raw humor  but I personally laughed like crazy every class she taught. BUT the work is boring a tedious and she has a strict absence policy. Also no curve and half the time she sends her TA's to teach for her. But just give a little effort and an A or B is no problem.
4.5,very easy...take notes and u'll pass  funny easy professor
4,Great class!!! I made a B but i could have made an A if i would have put forth a little more effort!! Shes fun!
3,Easy A if you pay attention. Crazy professor  doesn't show up for class half the time. Assignments are easy - all or none credit basically. Tests can be a little tricky if you don't read the book  but all the extra credit makes up for that. Overall easy class  just weird teacher.
4.5,Whoever said that she doesnt give extra credit must have been in the wrong class. I got a D on the 1st test and still got an EASY A. There was the chance for over 35 extra EASY points troughout the semester. She is hilarious  and will say just about ANYTHING. I would definitely recommend taking her.
4,This woman is a little crazy  but in a good way!! She gives lots of extra credit for group work  outlines  and Jeopardy. Tests are fair.. just be sure to read the book as well.. Take her for LBST credit..its a pretty easy A!
4.5,Hard tests but makes class fun...cool teacher!
4.5,I think she is hilarious and class is never dull. If you read the chapters and study  you will d fine in her class  and if you need help  do no hesitate to ask...the conceptual questions at the end of the chapters are a big help on the tests.
2,All we do is take notes. She gives no extra credit  and tests are VERY HARD!! You can study all you want  but it's not going to help on the tests. Don't take her.
5,Not the fairest grader in the whole world
3.5,He is a good professor who is not a difficult grader. He wants students to do well in the class  and gives tests that reflect the class material. Sometimes is a little all over the place during lecture  but overall  pretty clear and easy to undertsand.
4.5,I thought he was a very helpful teacher  actually teaches and writes notes in class unlike Westmoreland who expects you to learn it all on your own. Helpful and nice if you go in for extra help  if you do the homework and keep up with the work you will do well
3,The thing is  he does not grade fairly
5,Feil is an excellent teacher  though his tests are pretty tough. He explains problems very clearly.
5,good prof  helpful
3.5,good guy  taught well  decent tests
2.5,was not very consistent - had to write a chapter of logic proof and mine was the only critiqued in front of the entire class :( - not very helpful as an advisor
4.5,wow is he hard  but very good
5,I hated math until I took Dr. Neal's Calc I class. Then I took his Calc II and he convinced me to be a math major. I'm extremely grateful to Dr. Neal for making me feel so confident in myself. He's very caring and notices when something is wrong with a student.
3.5,hard. I had to take it for my major though
4,Dr. Neal is a very hard  very nice teacher. He is also one of my favorite people alive. He is dedicated to the students and cares about them to the fullest
3,Great guy  kinda awkward  and really hard. He is way too smart to be teaching an intro class. He cannot connect with normal people.
4.5,great professor. crazy hard
4.5,He's really fun to have a class with  but the homework in Proof Techniques is extremely difficult! It balances out in the end. If you enjoy a challenge  and you already have a firm grasp on calculus  take his classes.
4.5,Dr. Neal reminds me why I love math! He makes sure you truly understand the material. He has the best nerdy jokes too.
5,great professor. hilarious in a nerdy way. very hard class  but you learn a LOT
3,Funny in a very adorable  dorky way. Sometimes random  notes can be difficult to follow. Assigns a TON of homework and while none of it's ever due  I always felt bad knowing I had several hundred (no joke) calc problems I should be working on... tests are hard
2.5,I thought he was a good teacher. He explains stuff really well and is available to help.
5,The best math teacher I've ever had. He is so good at explaining things  it's really easy to understand what he's talking about.
4.5,Great guy  funny in his own nerdy way  extremely awkward but seriously kind. You have to work hard for his class. It's not easy  has plenty of homework  but if you work  you'll get what you want.
2,Dr. Neal was very funny. He is sorta awkward and nerdy  but in a good way. I enjoyed his class  becasue he was funny to be around  but he wasn't a very good teacher. I had a very strong calc. backround  and still had no freaking clue what he was ever talking about.
4.5,Humorous.. makes 8:30 calc worth going to. Always willing to help. Does assign lots of homework  but practice makes perfect! So just do it!
4.5,Dr. Neal is a great teacher! He gives a lot of homework  and does let you out late  but he is always willing to help. He is very enthusiastic about what he does  and is just such an awesome and funny person.
4,Agree with previous comments: seems cold at first but then he warms up to you and starts joking about things. Always lets you out of class a few minutes late. At times he can be unclear about material but he's willing to help you understand it.
5,Dr. Neal is so awesome! He seems a little cold at first but after a while you warm up to him! he is so awesome! just sit in the front row and joke around with him! he is very personal.
1,He's not a good teacher and holds you late every freaking class period. The man is nice and a little awkward but is only good at teaching one on one. He gets too nervous in class to teach.
5,Great man and great teacher. If you think that he is easy though you probably have only taken Calc I with him and not Fourier Analysis--and YOU suck at math.
3,For a Calc Class (101)  it was very easy. If you think he's hard  then you're just bad at math. Study a little bit. He's helpful and lenient when need be.
5,She is a good prof. She def. wants to help you if u are willing to try she will do what she can to help you do well. Her tests are fair  and if you do the reading you know what is going on she will like you and appercaites a hard worker
4,No Comments
4.5,Lariece is a really smart woman who knows how to relay info to others  but she seems a little impersonal. Tests are kinda hard  because all of the questions are open-ended. There really isn't a whole lot of work on syllabus either.
4.5,Great Professor  very willing to help. Do the reading and you will do fine. Very fair  not a lot of work except for reading a chapter a week  and 4 tests. Tests are hard  but fair. Very nice fair Professor  also good for non-majors!
2.5,hard quizzes  easy tests  easy exam
4.5,Prof. Brown is really good at what she does..she's thorough  always helpful  and cheerful. Def. take a class with her.
5,Shes nice

4.5,Dr. Gallaher is a fantastic teacher and truly cares about the success of his students. He gives amazing examples and uses many anecdotes in class in order to help students understand the material. He is most definitely the best English teacher I've met in my collegiate career and I'm glad I had a chance to take Comp. 2 with him.
5,This class was amazing! Its not your usual 4 or 5 page writing course. He makes things very engaging and different. We pretty much never used the book and the writing assignments were super easy. Also  we practically never stayed the whole class time.
4.5,It was a very easy class. All we did was write a couple papers and talk about the book  yet I still left feeling like I had learned something. It was not what I expected for accelerated composition. Highly recommended.
3.5,Take this class and this professor. No standards  no accountability  no guidelines. Easiest A I ever got (only A). Take the class durin yur hardest term. Cake.
5,I had Dr. Gallaher for Creative Writing: Poetry and he is awesome to have as a teacher. Really laid back and he made the class really fun and I always looked forward to it and went to every class  though he doesn't care about attendance. I liked him so much  I even made him my advisor. Definitely would recommend any of his creative writing courses.
5,He is an awesome teacher. Very easy class and easy to talk to. He makes learning fun and an overall great teacher!! I recommend taking him if you can! You only have to right 2 papers all semester with a length of 3-4 pages!
4.5,He's a great guy and the tests are very easy  he's willing to help you out alot!
5,This guy is crazy fun. He is really funny and I look forward to his class every day. He seriously cracks me up. Also  He's a good teacher. He presents things in way that makes you think differently at them. Bring your book. You'll just go over the chapters. Homework is pretty easy. Lots of in class discussions. I LOVE his class. You will too.
5,Yes  John is a FUN teacher  and he's a great guy to talk to. However  attendance is a huge issue--not his  the class. He doesn't hold his students accountable for attendance in his upper level classes  so a lot of times class is pointless. You could attend every day and get the same grade as a person who came the first and last day.
3,I'm not a fan. The free-willed nature of the professor is liberating  and for that I commend. However  that strength is the seed of his destruction. He offers hardly any challenge for the course  and is evident he isn't taking it seriously. You're better off with other professors.
5,Amazing  erudite  inspirational
4.5,I had so much fun in this class. I looked forward to attending every day  he really made the class interesting and funny! Was also very good about working with the class on due dates and helping with papers. Great teacher :)
4,Gallaher is my favorite teacher I had my first year at Northwest. He makes class fun and entertaining with his many jokes.
4,John is by far the best professor I've had at Northwest  he's not like all the other english department teachers who bore you with pointless material that you can't even understand. He makes the class fun and worth your time!
4.5,He tries constantly to not make the class boring or like basic book classes. He loves hearing student opinons because they give a different outlook to it. I recommend it to anyone especially if you don't like taking boring regular literature classes.
4.5,He's awsome and entertaining. Dosen't just stick to a certain schedule or course outline. He tries to get you understand and likes to hear his students opinion on the literature.
5,Every Northwest student should find a way to take a class with him at least once.

4,"funny guy  doesn't take this class too seriously. Also doesn't grade too hard  just make sure you put a lot of ""feeling"" into your essays. The papers are easy  b/c all you have to do is write about yourself  no research required. I'd recommened him  definitely."
5,Pretty cool. Keeps things to the point mostly. Wanders around a bit but that's ok. Funny. Doesn't take himself too serious.
5,"This professor's class. African American Lit was my favorite class of my university career. He challenged us to think about racially heavy topics. This is a very good thing for people to do. We ignore race far too often. The sentiment usually goes ""we all know racism is bad  so what else do we need to talk about."" He also chose wonderful texts."
3.5,The readings were really interesting and he's obviously a very smart guy. Intimidating at times and after taking numerous English classes  he is most definately the hardest marker that I've encountered..
4,Absolutely amazing. One of the best teachers I've had in my lifetime.
4,I found this class challenging and enlightening. Dr.Stewart is an animated lecturer who is passionate about his work. I found him a little intimidating  but he was always helpful when I went to see him. I loved the readings. Highly recommended.
3.5,Found this class irritating. Everyday he would tell us to read something and then the next day he would make US discuss it. Exam was HELL  he wanted you to memorize specific non-important quotations  it seemed. Found him arrogant but I don't doubt he has great analytical skills  which I picked up in the class. Too much content on race issues for me
4.5,very approachable very funny! be prepared for a lot of discussions
1,No Comments
3.5,He is a terrible professor. Some girls think he is hot  while some guys think he is cool. However  he is a rigid marker  a boring lecturer  and a cranky person. It's as if he gets off on trying to strike fear into some of his students.
4,Fascinating lectures  great material and an incredibly smart man. He's hard as Hell but he is generous with extensions. Beware the final exam.
3.5,I found his lectures clear  although I found that I could teach the material to myself better. This professor took me before the senate on plagiarism charges which I was innocent of and he ignored me as a student after the allegation which was extremely stubborn of him. He has a rep for doing  watch out. I still thought he was a good prof thou
4.5,I'm SO glad I got Prof. Stewart for my Short Story class. He was a fun and interesting teacher with a well-structured class and fantastic lectures. He's not shy about his own opinions  but he encourages opposition from his students as well. Definitely looking up his other classes to take in future.
5,Anthony is one mean (shut your mouth!). I'm talkin' about Anthony (and we can dig it!)
3.5,Very pompous concieted and overal I felt like I learned very little from the course.every class he would let students rant on about how each story related to their life-group therapy-esque .gag. I only marginally disliked him until I had medical problems and he accused me of lying to him not being a serious student.seemed like nice guy- but an assh
4,ShortStory-I understand how people think he's pompus and arrogant  but that made me like him even more. I found him funny rather than rude. Made the class more like discussion period rather than just a regular lecture. This was one of my fav classes. I found him helpful  he gave me good direction for my paper. Exam was more difficult than I expecte
4.5,(2304=Short Story
1,i hope he reads this one day and knows that straight up  the guy almost ruined my first year. with all these professors trying to make u feel welcome  here is dr. stewart and his condescending remarks and attitude. not a good person  and not a good teacher. i tried to tell him i was struggling  he couldn't have cared less. a real egomaniac  and jer
1.5,I had Dr. Stewart in an honours seminar a couple of years ago. He's one of the worst professors that I had the misfortune of encountering at Dal. Pompous  egotistical  inflexible and--unfortunately--not that good. That being said  if you're willing to follow his lead and you love critical theory  you'll probably be fine.
3,not only is dr. anthony stewart an unreasonable professor  but the man is  simply put  a pompous ass. he stalks over his lectures like some intellectual giant  when in reality he is just another run-of-the-mill professor who takes himself too seriously. his classes are always filled with racial overtones as well  and he'll constantly remind you he'
5,best marge simpson impression ever. Great prof  cares about students  funny  genius.
5,awesome prof. funny  smart  and kind. REALLY HARD MARKER & BRUTAL EXAM  but worth it because his lectures are great. i didn't skip once!
2,My worst grade for a course so far in university. I think it's the annoying overuse of textbook material that makes the class hard. It's very frustrating when all of your marks come from exams (based only on textbook material)  and there are no assignments or lab work. His slideshow notes are terrible - they contain only words and no explanations.
1,Horrible professor. Tests are irrelevant to material discussed in class and picks one-liners from the textbook that aren't important. WOULD NOT discuss this course.
1.5,Needs to be more things marked not just tests
1,Worst prof. Terrible  sexist prof. Makes jokes or comments and then spends 10 mins explaining he didn't mean it to be sexiest or racist. Lectures suck  all he talks about is his life and things from Toronto. Has biased opinions that he will share. Tests are complete bs. Puts stuff on there we've never discussed  you have to read every word in text
4,I was not a fan of Human Geography however Urban Geography was my favorite class. Was very interesting and he used multiple relevant examples. I would definitely take another class in the 200300 level with Dr. Eberts.
1,Worst class I have taken at BU. Professor not engaging and tests were not relevant to exams. Most test questions were insignificant facts etc. Sitting through the 80 minute class is extremely boring. Hardly worth attending since the lectures barely reflect the tests. Very disappointing.
1,Terrible prof! Worst class i've ever had  there was no point in attending class as he never talked about anything related to the course. Loses track of what he is saying and frequently has to read out of textbook or his notes. Refers too much to Toronto area where he went to school. Tests are b.s.  noone ever knew what to study. Students beware.
4.5,This class was a lot of fun to attend. The lecture notes were a little confusing at times. overall I would recommend it to anyone.
4.5,Very helpful if you have questions.
2,Inredibly boring
1.5,Unbelievable. Left class for a dentist appointment and expected us to sit around and wait for over an hour for him to get back.
2,He talks about such b.s. sometimes and things that weren't relevent to the class. His tests are aweful! just make sure you read the textbook!
4.5,I found Dr. Eberts to a very helpful. Although at first he may seem hard to approach once you talk to him he is fine. His Second and Third year classes are much better than the first year ones as he is more interested in the subject he is teaching.
3,Class lectures somewhat interesting but mostly dull. FAR too much focus on Toronto/Ontario. Assignments marked hard and often accompanied with useless/thoughtless comments. Exams quite difficult and don't adequately represent lecture/textbook material covered.
4.5,somewhat boring but has his random funny times which you dont expect and hes super nice to talk to. you learn a lot in this class and the tests/exams are really easy. good class overall
2,What a useless man  worst classes ever. Very dry lecture  test are impossible plus you have to deal with his snide little comments when you recieve assignments back. Avoid his classes at all costs
1,the worst prof ever!!cocky  rude not helpful arrogant....a complete ass
2.5,I think Eberts is really knowledgeable but NOT very approachable. His tests arent bad but he doesnt really help you out at all with notes  since he basically just talks about pictures. I also dont like his comments about people leaving his class  what if there's an emergency?!? and why do you care?? its not your problem if they dont wanna learn.
3,He's an okay guy  with an interesting lecture. But on tests  he picks the tiniest detail to test you on. Plus  there was a 50% midterm and a 50% final...what's with that?!
3.5,Knew his stuff and made the class interesting. Not very approachable.
5,I LOVE RON CAMERON. I take a class with him every year. He's my favorite professor. I've learned so much from him and I get that he's idiosyncratic but you will learn from him even if you don't like him. But he's hilarious and crazy and great.
5,He is the best person ever. He is a genius  totally energetic and all over the place  and totally devoted to teaching. He's also one of the funniest people on campus and definitely has the biggest personality on campus. I love him and have taken two classes with him and because of him I'm going to be a religion major. I've learned SO much from him.
5,Ron Cameron is the most amazing professor I've ever had. He is an incredible lecturer  and he is one of the leading experts in his field. He runs around the room  acts things out - you can tell he's extremely passionate about what he's teaching. He's also hilarious! Be sure to take a class with hime while at Wesleyan!
3.5,He is one of the smartest Proffesors on campus because of the fact he has taught this class for around 3 decades. His grading however is ridiculous and I assure you that you will get no higher than a B. Do not make the mistake I did by taking this class. GPA killer.
1,Horrible teacher. He seems passionate but it is about nothing. Hard to understand. I couldn't stand one and a half hours in a class with him. Worst lecturer I've ever had. He outright said Christianity and every faith is beautiful but wrong -- so derogatory.
4.5,Best teacher I've had a Wesleyan. His enthusiasm for the subject was infectious. I went into the class thinking I was going to drop it because the first reading seemed dense but he manages it to make it interesting and enjoyable. As long as you do the reading and take advantage of office hours when something is unclear  you'll be fine.
4.5,He's the man. Really interesting lectures and reading. Got me interested in studying religion.
4,Professor Cameron is a really enthusiastic guy  he is so well learned and his lectures are never boring. He really knows his stuff. He is a really tough grader though  I would get a B+ on his exam and he told me I did extremely well.I don't consider a B+ an extremely good grade  but he does. Focus on the topics he emphasized  they'll n on the exam
5,Prof. Cameron's enthusiastic interest in teaching and in class materials makes classes enjoyable and fantastic for learning!
3,amazing. take his class. He is crazy and a hard grader but good for the mind and really teaches a fascinating class.
2.5,Honestly  he is one of the most eloquent men I have ever heard speak
4,"Really really awesome. So so smart and he presents a very interesting view of the new testament. A lot of work  but really worth it. I learned so much. And he teaching method (including interesting uses of the word ""****"") is very engaging."
2.5,No Comments
4,I took him 15 years ago - and my biggest regret was not taking more courses with him. Yes a funny accent and at times goes on a bit - but brilliant  passionate and provoking.
4.5,Get past the Elmer Fudd accent and you'll find one of the best teachers Wes has to offer. Truly loves his subject and communicates his enthusiasm to his students.
4,He rules. Totally worth it.
4,completely awesome and engaging  although sometimes he's so hopped up on caffine it seems like he's the only one who has any idea what he's talking about...
1,Dr. Hall is a professor that you should avoid. I went to her for help and constantly wanted to improve in her class but she didn't care and didn't help me. She is very smart but not so good at getting the info across. Take someone else. Trust me.
2,If you're looking to take Hall for Sounding Numbers... AVOID THIS CLASS. Yes  it's easy but I've learned absolutely nothing. Longest lectures ever and they make no sense. She gives quizzes every Thursday. I personally hated this class because I had no interest in taking a music class. You HAVE to read her notes and she gives a crap ton of homework.
3,"Dr. Hall is a genuinely nice professor. She will let you make up quizzes and homework with some leniency. Homework and quizzes are assigned bi-monthly without the use of a syllabus calendar. Rachel will say ""at any rate"" about 5 times per class. Very hard to wake up for this class if its at 8am."
2.5,Don't take symmetry. Most pointless and confusing class I've ever taken. She's not a bad professor but the subject is just very confusing and abstract. It was a very awkward class. She will assign homework that doesn't make any sense  mainly because the textbook makes no sense. I would not recommend anyone taking this class.
1.5,Terrible professor. Does not know how to teach. Would not recommend taking her unless math is your strength. If you've taken calculus before its very easy but still rough to sit through.
3,Professor Hall is very nice and helpful  but her class can get boring at times. All the homework is on the syllabus and usually it's due once every other week. When homework is due you have a quiz. Sometimes she gets confusing  but as long as you keep up with the work you'll get a B.. will have to work a little bit for an A.
2.5,Tests aren't too bad  gives study guides for every one  final was easy  as long as you show up and take good notes as well as complete the study guides you will get a good grade in the class
2,She is such a hard grader and I would never ever want to take a class with her again. The tests also rarely make sense and the homework doesn't follow the noteslecture at all.
4,She is more interested in her music math classes than in this one for sure  but overall is a good teacher. If you don't get something the first time  she'll reteach it to you in a different way in office hours. Works with all types of learners. Must attend class if want help...skip if you want  but don't expect her to help you if you're stuck.
2.5,This class was pretty difficult and Dr. Hall was not much help. The text book is impossible to understand. Dr. Hall is very smart but doesn't have any people skills at all. Even with that  if you study hard you can still get a good grade.
4,"I was in Dr. Hall's class for two semesters of Excursions. Got into a lot of subject matter you wouldn't classify as ""math."" Wouldn't call it easy  but wouldn't call it hard either. Although there's usually one hard test per semester. But the quizzes every Friday can pull up your grade."
4.5,great teacher! gives an easy quiz every class period that is only 2 or 3 questions and she goes over it directly before you take it. gives 2 weeks to complete hw assignments. very helpful  easy b+/a
1,The class is really boring  and she is no help at all. I went to her office a few times and that was just a waste of time. The final project is kind of interesting. Tests weren't too bad if you knew your stuff.
3.5,Good teacher. Like a grownup teenager in a math genius body. Games almost every week!
2.5,hard class. quizes once a week. she is super smart when it comes to math but doesn't always know how to teach it well. wouldn't recommend if you did not have calc before
4,Great professor  tough material. You will get from her class what you put into it. As long as you show her effort  she will do her best to help you.
3,Nice person but perhaps on a different intellectual level at times. Lectures can be hard to understand. She will always help you if you ask and not too hard on due dates. Can grade hard at times.
5,She is one of the best profs at SJU.
2.5,shes nice and tried to make class fun sometimes  but pretty much didnt teach anything although she tried...she knows what shes talking about but didnt know how to teach it...we pretty much had to teach ourselves calc 2...i wouldnt recommend
1,just say no!! she is horrible
1.5,Worst class my first semester of freshman year. She is very disorganized  her lectures are all over the place  so it is hard to take notes  which also makes it hard to study for her exams. Her grading criteria and prompts are unclear  leaving you with little to no idea on how to do assignments/study for tests. Do not recommend.
2,She assigns a lot of readings  but you can get by without doing them as long as you take notes in class. Harsh grader on papers
4.5,I had her for African History which was good  but if you can get her for a smaller seminar  she is fantastic. Laid back  extremely intelligent  and very responsive and really tries to help if you have questions. Not always easy  but fair. Great prof.
2,....
3,The class itself was difficult and the I had a hard time in trying to understand what the professor wanted to convey.
3,Her class was interesting and well structured  but is covering a very difficult subject matter so it was understandably difficult at times. Extremely nice and knowledgeable woman.
2.5,nice lady. lectures are dull and pretty repetitive. it hard to keep track of terms because she doesnt go in chronological order. she grades pretty hard and points out very trivial mistakes. but gives flexibility with paper writing.
4,Lorelle Semley is incredible and extremely knowledgeable. Very engaging. The class was very enjoyable and a hell of a learning experience. Very harsh grader  though. Take her classes when she returns from sabbatical in the fall of 07
1,The class was terribly boring. Only 5 other students and it was a seminar. So poorly run with no guidance from the professor. It was a pretty bad class especially considering I was so excited to take it.
3.5,No Comments
2.5,this class has all the potential to be interesting  but it isn't. her lectures come right from the reading assignments  and aren't very engaging. sometimes it feels like she doesn't know her stuff.
3,Man can he talk! I would often find myself zoning out. He mostly just reads directly from the book for the entire class period without showing any visuals or anything interesting. One redeeming quality is that he is extremely funny  and injects his humor throughout. Your entire grade is dependent on the two tests: midterm and final grades.
5,He is an excellent professor. He knows the material he is teaching. I enjoyed his class because he tried to connect the past and the current events. He does his best to make the class interesting and also is very kind and tries always to help his students. I only had 1 midterm  3 papers and 1 final. Take him! He is a very nice professor.
2.5,He gives a lot of papers and is vague on the material. For the midterm and final he gives you six essay topics to memorize but only two are on the test. Extremely stressful.
2,This guy LOVES to hear himself talk! From the time class starts until the very end  HE'S TALKING! Everything he says comes right from the book! The tests are outrageous and the papers are incredibly hard! He's a nice enough guy  but he's a horrible instructor!
3,He's a nice guy but his teaching style is extremely boring. This class was one night a week  three hours and he doesn't give any breaks which wouldn't be so bad if he mixed things up a bit. The three papers we had for the class were on topics that only got touched on the week before the due date. Tough grader. Wouldn't take a class with him again
2.5,Doesn't like his teaching style. No power-point straight from the book. Not specific of what he wants in a paper. lectures are long and mundane. Makes you wanna go to sleep! Gets distracted easily.
3,class is not an easy A but its not horrible. theres weekly papers  two tests and a final exam. the tests consist of 25 MC and 1 essay. he hands out potential essay questions a week in advance. MC choice questions are difficult but writing a decent essay is enough to make up for that. overall  he is a really nice prof even though the class is hard
1.5,DO NOT TAKE HIM! Papers every single friday on what we talked about in class. You have to fit every reading in the paper somewhere and theres at least 20 readings. Its awful. At least 6-7 reading for each class. Gives no help even if you ask. Tests are impossible! FIND A DIFFERENT TEACHER IF YOU ARE TAKING THIS CLASS!
2,NEVER TAKE THIS MAN  paper every Friday  tests are impossible  class averages about a 60 each test. Doesn't curve. Grades the papers unfairly and is very unclear as to what will be on the test.
2,Don't take this class! So much reading assigned for each class and a paper due every Friday. A few tests with mc on very minute details and an essay on each test.
5,The class itself is easy considering that there are only two tests and Dr. Zeman gives you study guides  although they are long  that lay out word-for-word exactly what you have to know. Attendance/participation are absolutely mandatory  but Zeman is super friendly and lays out everything clearly and is very receptive to questions.
4.5,Very interesting class! Quizzes/ tests were challenging but if you study hard you'll do fine. Only drawback is that there were six required books for American Military and War. Either way  I'd take it again.
4.5,He's a good teacher. Class is somewhat boring just listening to his notes  but the class is easy. we only had one paper  three exams. the exams are kind of hard but he makes it very clear what you need to know. im taking him again next semester because i really liked the class
5,Funny guy  he really knows his stuff. If you read the textbook  you will be fine for the tests. Make flash cards and do the essays before hand and see him during office hours - he will give you answers and help for the tests. Very laid back  can't wait to take him again!
3.5,he is a SUPER nice guy and LOVES history  but class is very hard. used to be that he had quizzes once a week which were a pain  but the tests were impossible so at least you could count on them to help you. got rid of quizzes so now it's just the impossible tests... VERY HARD!!! for a GER i would recommend someone else
3,he's a good guy  genuinely. no more quizzes  and really difficult exams. but he wants you to do well so if you see him he is an extraordinary resource. he will go out of his way to make sure you are doing well if you just show you care. you dont HAVE to read the book  but it does help a lot. he goes over everything imp't in class. id take him again
3,To everyone considering taking him  heres a warning.Hes totally changed his style. No more quizzes or matching on the tests. The tests are all fillin and he gives no specificity on who to concentrate on so u have to know who over 300 people are for a test on top of at least 3 essays  which he grades hard. Cool dude  but be cautious.
4,very hard class  68 was average score on tests  doesn't give quizes anymore  and you have to know all the people from the text. nice teacher though.
4,zeman is the man. TAKE HIM. 2 tests make up 75 percent of your grade and the questions on the test are directly off the quizzes. plus he gives you the essays ahead of time. the bad: 1 quiz a wk is a major pain (only 10% of avg tho)  paper is nearly impossible to write but he grades it easily (lowest grade was a 10/15). youll prob get a b
5,you never have to read... he pretty much tells reads the chapter for you in class... great teacher and very helpful... take him
4,She's a great teacher and knows her way around a piano. You will need to practice if you want a good grade.
4,She is nice and whenever you have a test and mess something up she will go through it with you until you get it right  so it's hard to make a bad grade in there. She likes it when you practice so be sure to do that. It isn't a hard class for me.
5,She teases  but it's only teasing  and she does it to everyone. And she really knows piano backwards and forwards  and will help you out in a minute. Her grading is also very fair- just practice  you'll be okay. :)
3.5,She is an ok teacher  but I think she should act more professional and keep her personal life personal
5,she is vert good at what she does and extremely helpful
4,fun and nice
4.5,She is patient with me even though my hands fly about on the piano as if unattached from my body. She is a great teacher to have...if you love piano  you will love Mrs. Austin.. :) (Mrs. Austin  If you are reading this  can you just give me an A and cancel my jury?? lol)
2,I thought she was unfair in her grading. She also canceled a lot of my lessons.
5,Ms. Austin is one of the best music teachers I have ever had. Take her and you'll enjoy yourself highly. Shes really stylish. Ms. Austin #1!
5,she's really nica and will always work with you if you need help
5,I love this lady! She is so helpful and patient with her students and always willing to help. The playing tests aren't bad and she's great at explaining things :-) I'm not a music major but I still take piano with her
5,EASY  EASY  EASY and Fun!!!!
5,Great teacher  do the worksheets and practice and you'll be fine. She is very easy to talk to in or out of class  very down to earth person.
5,I love this class. You have to make sure you practice outside of class. Its not too bad you might be able to make it by a few times without practicing because she works with you a lot. I love her she if fun and funny and... dare I say it not too bad to look at LOL. If your not good with piano take her class she is great at teaching
5,She is like my favorite teacher  and she can really play. She isn't to serious and she isn't afraid to laugh at us when we sound bad!!!
5,No Comments
5,She was a wonderful teacher. I wasn't able to read music at all before the class but at the end of 182 I could read music pretty well. From this it shows that she is an wonderful teacher. Anyone will have a great time in her class. Just make sure you put your practice time in or she is going to know that you hadn't practiced.
5,Awesome teacher! She's also my accompanist and she's just wonderful!
5,She is the best! I loved going to her class
5,Love Mrs. Austin!! She's the best and she's very easy to talk to about anything!!! I highly recommend her to anyone
3,Easy teacher  doesn't have much experiance  just got up and left in the middle of a term. I don't know where she went off to.
5,easy!!! she was hyped on coffee all year  but was extremely easy. she related everything to students.
5,If you don't do well in her class is because you missed too many. She's a great professor.
5,She is a really nice teacher  she is very devoted and explains everything clearly
5,She is one of the best professors at DeVry. She is helpful and very clear. Go to all classes and do all homework. She covers a lot of material in one day. Also  don't be afraid to ask questions.
1,No NO NO at all....
4,If you attend class and do homework all comes easy except the final. That was hard.
2,No Comments
5,Good teacher. If you need this class and want to succeed - take her as your teacher.
4,She is a very nice professor. If you do not understand a concept all you have to do is ask and she will go over it until you grasp the concept. I wish she taught more courses than she does. I would recommend her to anyone.
1.5,"This woman does not allow extenuating circumstances to occur during the term  she does not help one bit. In fact I was never led to believe I was doing poorly in the class. I found out when I recieved an ""F"" on my report card. She is an Ice Q"
4,KEEP UP ON THE TEXTBOOK READING! If you keep up with the reading and make the weekly note sheets for the exams you will ace this class. If you procrastinate and try to do all the reading the weekend before the exam you will be SCREWED.
4,You will have homework every day and his tests are extremely hard  but he curves grades generously and is very clear about what you need to do to get an A. Good class - you'll learn a lot and probably end up with an okay grade.
2,great guy not such a great class. If you are not good at math you are screwed. this is a teacher who knows his stuff so when it comes to teaching there is not a lot of variety in explanations. Can be hard to follow.
5,Amazing teacher if you are willing to put in the time. He goes out of his way to make sure every student understands. Can be extremely creative in his teaching methods. Student needs to be responsible or he will not keep up.
2,He definitely has a passion for the spiritual side but totally lacks teaching skills. I took him for Computer Application and he didn't teach anything. Took him for Nonprofit and the students taught the class! He gets paid well for not teaching much.
3,Has a greater passion for outreach than finance.
5,He is a great guy and wonderful with Glee. However  his conducting leaves more to be desired!
5,OMG! WONDERFUL PROF! Eveyone sould take Glee Club even if they can't sing. Coach will help you discover your inner voice. And he will help you make it beautiful.
5,AWESOME!!! I love Coach so much!! I you dont like to sing after this class you will love it. He's so wonderful!
5,WONDERFUL PROF! well  actually he's called coach  but who cares? the class is easy if you work on the music. and we get to go to New York and sing in Carnegie Hall too!
5,Coach is awesome! He makes music so fun and the choir is incredible. He is such a good teacher and the concerts turn out to be just perfect!
5,Great teacher and is willing to do anything for his students!! He's hilarious and makes the class fun!
5,this man just rocks. he knows his stuff  and is willing to work with you if you have any trouble with the music
5,This man is sooo passionate about music and the voice. He is really helpful in technique. He can be quite sarcastic sometimes  but overall  he's cool. You basically decide when you want to come to class  but  you wont want to miss it. Stress Reliever!
3,Easy A!!!!!!!!!

2,Terrible teacher- he sells you his book for more than it is worth- then his lectures and notes are not adequate for his exams- his tests are harder than the material he gives. He is arrogant and insulting- thinks he is the greatest gift to the field of Geography.
4,Took 5 classes from him: -1st year Weather/Climate  people piss around and then get mad when they fail
1.5,What a mess. I was injured while I was taking the class where I couldn't sit and asked for an exam deferal  he told me to stand and write the exam! Rude! Avoid this guy.
3.5,He only seems like a very scary man  as long as you attend lectures and make notes in your book his classes are a breeze. A great Prof once you get through his first year class
2,"Interesting class  yet so hard to learn because of the prof's teaching methods. Probably the worst prof I've ever had. Although he may think his models are ""simplifications of reality""  they are just plain confusing. Can be quite ignorant as well. I would suggest to avoid this class at all costs if Mcginn is still the prof."
4,Great
3,3 Thumbs down. Make sure you buy HIS textbook that he makes and sells himself or be prepared for a lousy mark.

2.5,Wow...hard course to begin with  but the lecture diagrams didn't make it any easier.
1,No Comments
4,Not for slackers. Gives you all the information that you need and expects you to learn it. One of the craziest senses of humor on the faculty. Take his class but be prepared to pull your weight.
1,The guy doesn't know anything unless the text is right in front of him. Hardest class I've ever taken. Weird since it's an intro class.
5,McGinn is a very fair prof. The course material is not the easiest  but if you remember his dumb jokes it will help you at test time. Go to the tutorials if you want to make the grade.
5,Makes geography simple
4.5,Loved it  made tedious details in course very interesting and applicable  good professor
1,Impossible course. No help  just slides and lecture. Is very rude  annoying  and arrogant. Avoid like the plague if at all possible.

1,impossible course! worst class I ever took! Definitely not an 'intro' course!

1.5,Hard!!
2,Dr. Gubacs uses her class to present her work to up and coming teachers. The class has no purpose. She is very unorganized and the class was a hybrid and assignments are unclear. She cares more about her outside stuff then her class. I was extremely disappointed with the course. She also loves to talk about how great she is.
5,Best professor ever!! Made class interesting and really enjoys teaching.
5,I took her class over the summer and it was hybrid. It was so easy! She is an awesome teacher and very fair on everything. All the students had her before except me and they all knew her and loved her. She definetly makes the class interesting and I would definetly recommend.
5,Dr. Gubacs is a fantastic professor. She is a great athlete and does a good job teaching and relating to the student. Very kind woman and I look forward to taking another course with her in the future.
5,Dr. Gubacs is my hero and I'm not even kidding. I loved her class (badminton  fencing  and tennis) and I loved her as a Professor. She is extremely professional  courteous  fun  I loved her drive and competitiveness  and really taught us how to teach!! I would highly recommend Dr. Gubacs as a professor. Taking her again in the fall.
4,Gubacs rocks. Class was easy but sometimes boring. Just show up and do some work and you will do just fine. She tries to help you as much as she can so just ask.
5,ARCHERY GOLF AND TRACK AND FIELD. SHE'S A GREAT TEACHER. VERY FUN CLASS. HAD HER IN THE SUMMER 3 WEEKS AND IT FLEW BY. JUST SHOW UP TO CLASS AND WORK HARD AND YOU ARE GUARANTEED AN A. GUBACS RULES!!!!!!!!!
4.5,Great professor! Very interested in all sports  very competitive. Just dont be a primadona and show up and you are pretty much guaranteed an A. Class is also very fun and interesting! P.S. she loves to talk about the soccer league she is in so beware!
5,best teacher ever...makes you work hard but it pays off in the end!!! gubacs rules!@
5,Great teacher  motivator  talker  advice giver  just all around greatness. I had her for all of my sports modules and I enjoyed every single minute and every single class. She's a very competitive teacher and I know many people that didn't like that about her. But if you're going to be a phys ed major then u need to step up ure athletic skills before u think about taking her class. She likes athletes  not cheerleader!!!
5,She is great. I learned tons from her. She is always willing to help. She is my favorite professor:)
5,she's hot
5,excellent professor always interested in her students and improving her teaching skills. And ver  very hot
5,best teacher i have had so far in the phys ed dept
3.5,great class
4,Awesome job this past semester. I didn't think I would have fun playing Golf  doing track and field and Archery but I had a blast. Very nice to give us cool T-shirts at the end too. Tests were fair and easy.
5,outstanding. she may be tough but i think she helped me figure out why i wanted to teach phys ed.all you have to do is pay attention speek upin class  pass the test and just show that you care about this major and you will be fine.she is tough but its to help you get ready for the real world
4.5,awesome prof. just participate athletically  show interest  help out  and you'll get an A
3.5,It was a fun class and she is okay. She just thinks she is a little better in some sports than she really is. Keep it cool Doc  you are not going to win all the time.
5,She is the bomb. Great teacher and competitor. Fun classes.
5,She is a great professor! She is pretty gracious  but does expect a lot from her students. I would take her again for Aural in a heartbeat!
1,I tried going to her office for help. She asked me questions  then I tried to answer them but got them wrong. She then said I needed to get help. Um  that's what I was there for. She has a difficult language barrier. No matter how much I did  I could not pass. Who grades homework anymore? That did nothing but have my grade go lower and lower.
4,Absolutely brilliant professor. She could probably write a music theory textbook herself if she wasn't busy teaching every class and doing research. She's sometimes too brilliant to understand  but she's always more than willing to help you  and she'll look over your projects as well. Also  she's really  really adorable. Fun class!
5,Dr. Deguchi's class is NOT easy  because the subject (music theory) is not easy. She is brilliant and an excellent teacher. She takes time with students who don't understand (most at WU sadly) and holds LOTS of extra office hours. I could not have made it through theory without Dr. Deguchi.
2,Really is not a process oriented teacher at all. If you don't already know what questions to ask  don't take her classes. Nice person who tries to help if needed  but not a great teacher.
3.5,Dr. Deguchi is really sweet  and she's an amazing musician. She's an okay professor  her grading is fair  and her accent is amusing. But the textbook will be your greatest friend  she bases her teaching solely on the book at times...
5,You can never appreciate Deguchi until you have someone else. She is always willing to help and the easiest theory techer here!
3.5,mrs deguchi is a very tough tough teacher. you really have to work in her class to pass...but she is very willing to help out students which makes a her a pretty good teacher in my eyes.
4,She's hard to understand at first but after being in her class a couple of days you start to translate well. She's always really helpful if you ask! She just expects you to apply yourself. Calls on people in class and laughs when answers wrong. But she's funny and a good teacher.
3,Sometimes you can't understand very well  but she makes up for it with her hotness.
1,She does not teach class. She reads the text book. Her suplements are total BS. I wish she could speak  and understood that sometimes we don't understand her. She always plays the piano as lound and hard as she can.
4,Hard class if you hate theory. She does a good a good job of explaining things to you. She always makes me laugh with her accent and how she pronounces words!!! But it's a very time consuming class so have time on your hands for the projects!
3,There is a lot to learn in this class if you show up. Attendace policy is strict and the projects are time consuming....not hard...time consuming.

3,"She makes clear at the start she uses a ""flipped"" teaching style  in that students teach students and she guides. It is quite literally that  and with it being an intro class  no one has any clue what they're teaching. You learn everything on your own  she teaches nothing and occasionally shows videos. She stresses she is lazy  and she sure is."
2.5,The first half of the semester is on book material and the second half is doing a confusing as hell group project - it did not help that she missed so many days of class. The tests are somewhat difficult but if you read the book you should be good to go. Make sure to ask her questions outside of class because her instructions are often vague.
1.5,The course was pointless  provided no insight into simulation due to her teaching style  and like all of her classes she taught it like a management class and you learn nothing about the subject because she doesn't know anything about it. This is the only class that directly involves simulation in the BGS major and it added nothing to my knowledge.
1.5,You essentially need to have your book  and constantly read it in order to understand what is going on. She doesn't lecture  but has you become the teacher in the course and teach everyone else. It's difficult to understand what is happening because she constantly switches between talking about the class and hypothetical scenarios without warning.
1,Anita is a nice person  but she generally has no idea what she is talking about and is usually completely unprepared for her lessons. The book actually tries to show you the content of the course  I have doubts if she has ever read it. Beware of her extreme problems with clarity and habits of assigning homework through email at random.
1,She has never once lectured or taught any material the entire class. Stupid reading quizzes every weekend. All you do is show up to class she gives you a group presentation to prepare in 20 minutes and you teach the class yourself. She requires you too write ridiculous long papers for certain assignments. A horrible 100 level class.
1,She is clearly over her head and has no idea what she doing. She talks to hear herself be friendly  has no true industry in-site that does not come out of a book. She plays favorites  and is straight up two faced. Never take courses or the gaming degree from this school.
1.5,Has no real idea what she is teaching  and has no industry insights to help the students grow into the job market. Complete waste of space.
4,All of the gaming classes she teaches and the 3D modeling class are boring. She doesn't actually teach. You either do nothing  work on projects  or watch videos that teach. If you are working on projects it is pointless because you have plenty of out of class time to get them done.
3,She is a very cheerful lady and extremely excited about what she does. Loves to hear herself talk and the class is more boring than peeling a potato. Plus she gives a ton of assignments. good luck
4.5,So easy and fun. She loves what she's doing. Its a class on how to use a computer and different things on the web. On class was spent discussing whether to buy a PC or a Mac. That was also one of our assignments. So easy and helpful. Just do all your homework and you'll get an A. She'll do whatever she can to help you. AWESOME!!!
4,Very nice and down to earth prof  easy going  and easy classes. Do the angel quizzes and you'll do fine. (Open book on the exams!) I didn't turn in 2 homework assignments  and near the end of the semester I asked if I could turn them in for a grade  and she allowed without any complication. Why can't all of them be this nice. Would take again.
3,My roommates said the way she teaches it now is a lot harder than before. Everyone did poorly on the CASE study we had to do. I had a group that did not understand the material completely  which did't help. By the time she explained the material in full for teh section  we had to hand it in. People that went for help still recieved bad grades.
5,Great professor. Knows her stuff - has open office hours. Very nice - brings in candy and stuff. Definitely recommended!
3,the class isnt easy  its a 300 level course but when i took the class she seemed like she was a little confused herself on what to teach.. always seemed like a spontaneous class
5,loved the class
4.5,Dont even bother going to class and get an A. If you know access well
5,Very nice professor. Pays attention to the students needs. Very helpful and interesting class.
5,good teacher. very helpful. if she herself is unclear about something she will check it out.

1,She will unleash the beast if she catches you with ANY technology in your hand. Most difficult class I have ever experienced. Professor seems as though she hates her life and likes to take it out on innocent students. Lecture slides are irrelevant and she talks too quick to catch anything. DROP THIS CLASS ASAP.
3,Generic intro course lectures. I found them interesting and useful for classes I have taken since then.
1,TESTS are HARD! Not enough time to answers questions. Questions are irrelevant to anything  they are random  and there's no way anyone would know the correct answer. Don't take this class.
3,She really knows her stuff  but her lecture slides aren't very helpful. Offers extra credit quizzes a couple times throughout the semester so I'd go to lectures
1,Her lectures were incredibly specific and too advanced for an introductory class. She would wonder why no one was understand anything and the concepts were uninteresting in the way she presented them. She doesn't seem to care about the intro class at all. Is only in it for her own research.
3,Boring lectures  doesn't allow technology in lecture or discussion  offers random extra credit quizzes about four times during the semester for up to 12 points so it's worth going to lecture. The slides are online but they definitely do not have all the information you need to know.
2,She is an incredibly smart person  but a terrible professor. I had her for an introductory class but she acted as if we were supposed to already know everything. She spent at least half the class rambling about nothing important and then wondered why nobody understood anything.
3.5,She didn't let the class use technology to take notes  but it didn't matter as she provided the power point slides on ICON  all I had to do was print them off. I recommend taking notes directly on the power point slides she provides for the class. Exams are over lectures and the textbook. She explains everything in detail. A lot of extra credit!
3,"Subtly sneaks her political views into lectures - liberal Extremely condescending  says at least once a week ""oh  you're too young to know who X is"" when X is a prominent politician or celebrity"
4,Great Professor. Little bit hard and there are many things to read but very intelligent and try really really hard to help students. If you actively ask for help you will get an A. Not easy class but if you try  you can get an A. A range is quite wide as well. She gives lots and lots of extra credits.
1,Shes nothing but an arrogant airhead. She loves listening to herself talk and acts surprised when no one follows the lecture.
1.5,Test are arbitrary and difficult. Lectures are confusing  boring and sporadic. No curve and little extra credit. Avoid this professor at all costs.
1,Professor knows her stuff but chooses not to share with class in an easy and understanding way. Off topic in lecture  tests are sporadic and the class is overall confusing. Do not recommend with her.
1,Not helpful  off subject in lecture. I would not recommend this class  especially for a gen ed. It could be interesting  but this professor is horribly boring.
2,She says reading the textbook is mandatory  but don't waste your money or time. Attend lectures and take notes and be prepared to answer the most arbitrary facts on the tests. All in all  I do not recommend taking this course with her as the instructor.
2.5,As a professor Kelly was great. Her teaching style is fun and kept me interested. The way the course was conducted was my struggle. The first half of the course is heavy reading that is meant for someone who is an expert in the subject. The books we read are much simpler in the second half. Class was mainly a lecture to confused faces.
1,Horrible professor. Asks about extremely arbitrary things on tests. She says read the textbook  but honestly you have to know the random things that she decides. Do not take this class.
5,Great professor. Very intelligent  inspiring and truly cares about students. Gotta love her.
4,Great professor. Very knowledgable in her field. I took intro to International Relations with her  it was a hard class  but if you actually go to lecture and read the textbook it isn't bad. She can be kind of jumpy with material sometimes  but makes the content easy to understand. Lots of extra credit opportunities as well. Would recommend.
2,She knows her stuff  but the tests are impossible. Lectures are boring and I find it hard to understand what she's teaching. Discussion doesn't help much either.
3.5,Not a very friendly professor  but his class is extremely easy. It's hard to stay awake during the lectures  but take his class for an easy A!
3.5,mcnorton tries hard to make a boring class fun. he doesnt always answer questions clearly and sometimes doesnt even give you an answer at all  but a very nice man
4,Not the greatest presenter (kind of boring actually) but you do learn good basic computer application skills. He gives 3 exams and a final along with a computer assignment from each software as well as a web page. It was very easy to make an A!
5,Knowledgable. Extremely helpful. Excellent class lectures. Labs can be difficult  but you learn a lot from them.
5,really easy  should take

4,a great teacher  she is hard  but fair  and will push you to do your best
4,many people dislike her  but I think she is helpful once you know what she looks for. The class is annoying  but she is as helpful as she can be.
1,"Yeah this (expletive deleted) is evil. SHe tried to get a friend of mine thrown out of school because of a ""mis-cited"" quote. If I were any of you underclassmen contemplating taking her  steer faaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrr away."
3,This lady lost my last paper  which I turned in on time. And then gave me a zero on it.
3,Yo  she gave me all C's on my papers. If you take her  your gonna have to work. She works you with 3 big essays and 5 assignments. I would take another teacher if i were you
2,Focuses on immigrants the entire class  and grades more on citations and MLA style rather than content. Does not give anything higher than a C unless your very lucky.
2.5,Prof. Allen makes students do rough drafts  but doesnt critique the drafts as she would the paper  its pointless... she has good class discussions but is infatuated with citations and a well written paper with citation mistakes usually gets a c
2.5,Nice lady but not very successful or helpful in the teaching aspect.
1,everyone said writing sem 2 was suppose to be easier and more interesting because it relates to your major  well that def isnt true  with the expection of learning useless citations that you will never use in the business world her class was a waste
2,No Comments
1,No one here is an english major here  it seems she thinks otherwise. Take at least one letter grade off for what you think your paper should get. Every single word of a paper will be looked at with insane scrutiny. Avoid at all costs.
1.5,You either get it or you don't- basically the first grade you get it the grade you'll always get. I went to tutor after tutor and could not get more than a C+. You can't miss any classes for any reason  even one and she'll drop your particapation grade
1.5,if you have her don't expect to get a grade better than a B on any of your papers  and u better hope u don't have any family emergencies that you need to miss class for  she failed my friend for missing class b/c of a serious emergency
4.5,Great proffessor... I don't know what you slackers are talking about giving her negitive remarks... there need to be more like her
3.5,"Had Allen 4 last 1/2 sem.  1st teacher's elevator didn't go to the top floor so she was ""replaced"". Anything was better. Al. knew her stuff  offered help outside class. Very anal  checks EVERY citation  don't forget to quote ""the"" if u"
1,Not open to students opinions  very defensive when spoken against.
1,Worthless Teacher...you guys must be **** or sucking on her pen15. She's a worthless human being.
4,Come on guys - she's pretty easy - I got an A - just a little boring that's all. I'd suggest taking her for an easy grade guaranteed.
5,Prof. Allan is not as bad as she is made out to be here. Yes  she is a tough teacher and she expects a lot of work  but she also is very willing to help you out with any questions. This is not an impossible class  but you must be prepared to do work.
5,Is....Was....And still is the best teacher at tech.
4.5,Best teacher ever. I couldn't believe he was even still teaching here.
3.5,Great teacher. Awesome class.
4,Best teacher ever. Take him if you can.
3.5,Great teacher  has a hard time pronouncing simple words though.. like ode for example..
4.5,Ultimate techer ever.
2.5,Randomly spouts off about how sexy he is. Sometimes people just don't understand.
5,Jim is the coolest... rock on ROWDY
1,Horrible. Even if you're interested in the subject he's teaching  don't take him. If he's the only one  find another course  it will ruin any gpa you currently have.

1,Worst teacher ever. What a loser.
1,would be a much better teacher if he would read the Wild West book he talks about
1,This guy complains about everything. What a clown shoe.
1.5,Bad professors dont waste your time with this stupid class because of this stupid professor
1,let me just say  i took his class last semester  not only was it one of the worst experiences of my life  but even now  one semester later  i still run and hide when i see him on campus. please don't waste your time or your sanity.

1,The only reason why this teacher is still around is because he is married to the dean. He told us we wouldn't have a final exam  then he slaps us with a 12-pg final paper and a final exam that covered over 2 000 pages of reading. The class was ridiculously boring to the point of being hilarious. Seems like an easy A  but it WASN'T. The class SUCKS!
1,Aaagh! He is the college dean's husband - in that sense he's more part of the architecture than part of the curriculum. Sometimes I see him coming and I run away. Don't bother. You pay lots of money to be here.
2.5,Do not take this class. It was more like a boring theo class than English. I felt unprepared bcause I didn't have the Bible memorized. He also told us there wouldn't be a final  and there was  plus a term paper. I went to him for help once  and he was very unhelpful and told me I was bad at his class English because I was in the MSB. AVOID!!
1.5,"His class was a total waste of time and tuition. Don't take this class unless you can quote the Bible offhand and take religious text at their literal meaning. You won't talk about any typical ""english"" topics in this class  - it's purely religion. In fact  I just realized something: THIS SHOULD NOT BE AN ENGLISH CLASS. IT IS THEOLOGY."
2,basically hell in a classroom. Only take this class if you are ridiculously interested in saints and are very catholic.
1,absolutely awful. how does this man still have a job here?
1.5,i cannot recommend strongly enough against taking this class. mcauliffe makes no effort to analyze works objectively or put them in a historical context--feels more like a 6th grade religion class.
2,very strange class. you read books about nuns and monks fantasizing about jesus and weird things like that. if you like taking the literal meaning of weird religious texts very seriously  this class is for you. mcauliffe has mood swings. sometimes he is easy and nice  sometimes he is condescending and makes you feel like a jerk for not reading.

2.5,Even though Prof. McAuliffe means well he deals with the subject matter in an uninteresting way. He focuses on the most irrelevant and uninteresting aspects of the readings. Furthermore  he is often irrational when discussing the texts and acts dogmatically when you prompt him on these interpretat
2,"He didn't have a syllabus for the course  so you would find out on Monday that you had a big reading assignment for Wed.  no good. He also would say read ""selections"" from a book and not assign specific pages  and then he would be disappointed if you didn't read something he wanted you to. Avoid"
1.5,McAuliffe is well-meaning man and a good scholar  but a ineffective teacher with a fatal penchant for uninteresting tangents. Our Love/Eros class was poorly planned and conducted in a slack  disoriented style. Until he gets this class together  seek guidance into this great reading somewhere else.
3.5,Dr. McAuliffe is a really nice person. He has trouble expressing himself in class but one-on-one he is extremely helpful. The reading load for his class was pretty light and just a term paper for graded work. No midterm or final. Weblogs due on a weekly basis and a heavy emphasis on class discussion
1.5,Great if you like taking a class taught by a moron. Also great if you take the bible at its literal meaning  like he does.

2.5,She is sweet and can be funny at times. Her accent is hard to understand but she is always willing to help. Other than that the class is painstakingly awful. It's entirely lecture  some videos. Must follow the news before class. You HAVE TO study for her tests  she gives you a ton of information and really doesn't like when students miss class.
3,The class was mainly discussion based and movies. Tests are extremely curved. Overall  she is a very nice professor and wants to give you a good grade.
3,Dr hosseini was a great professor. My only problem was she throws a lot of info at you for her exams  so make sure to study. Even if people tell you she curves  don't count on it. She's very nice though and the course load is light. Take her!
2,Very boring but very easy.
3.5,she's super nice and so cute! the class is pretty boring but its pretty easy  she curves on tests.
5,She is fabulous. Her expertise in Healthcare is displayed in this course. She is a very intelligent woman who is a delight to have for class. She is wonderful to talk to in and out of class. I love her. Take her for anything you can. Highly recommended.
4.5,Dr. Hosseini is one of the cutest instructors at King's. She gives the students a stack of notes on one of the first days of class and reads it word for word throughout the semester. The class is actually interesting. The exams are fairly easy if you pay attention in class and she curves like there is no tomorrow. Highly recommended.
3.5,loved her! she is the best! if you like boring but super easy classes take her! and for islamic cultures she is really funny! the tests are nothing but super easy!
5,She is a wonderful professor. I enjoyed her calss and learn alot from it Take her course.
5,She is very helpful and willing to help if you are behind and very interesting class
5,she is one of the best professors that I ever had . Nice personality and very clear.
1.5,she is very unclear. but shes nice and if you beg her for a review she will give it to you. read the book for the tests. u dont need it for class. she is so so boring tho. she talks and talks and u probably will fall asleep. Easy course except for the tests.
5,she is wonderful teacher
5,such a great personality .
5,extremely nice and knowlegable and helpful
5,She is a wonderful teacher  very kind and knowledgable and fair. Take her course
5,She is a wonderful teacher. She knows alot and every one like her so much
2,Hold on tight kids  get ready to be bored out of your minds. While your at it  get ready to be tested on material that isin't covered. Pay close attention to her facial expressions  because she'll look at you like your doing something wrong. She's so paranoid about cheating it's actually funny. She is difficult to understand and hard to hear. DONT.
2,Difficult to understand and told us that she didn't want us to use the bathroom during her class! How old we are? If someone has to use the bathroom that is their responibility to both their health and comfort. I never encountered something like that with any other professor in my entire collegiate career. I was shocked.
4,She's pretty nice and was willing to help me when I got sick and fell behidn in class. She's knowledgeable about the class material. the amount of notes can be overwhelming. But  tests are curved lot and grades are pretty generous so if you put in effort you'll be rewarded.

1,She is SO politically biased  that she will demean you in front of everyone if you have a different opinion  even though SHE ASKED WHAT YOUR OPINIONS ARE. She also believes we need to get rid of math and science and focus on art. I'm trying to become a PA  what does that mean about my job?
3,She will make you print out almost every reading for class. Will have at least three readings every night of at least 6 pages. Outrageous amount of work.
2.5,If you are a design major  like I was  I do not recommend taking her. Her class is way too demanding. She assumed her class was most important when it wasn't even relevant to my major. Expect to read 20+pages every night and have a lot of homework. She assigns a long paper that is split into smaller ones  but still makes it difficult for you.
2,Terrible.
1.5,Horrible professor. Worst teacher i've ever had. class discussions are so boring  the hardest class i had. tons of reading and work and she makes you write discussion questions for everything you read every night. extremely harsh grader and papers are long and hard! stay far away!
5,!!!
4.5,this class will expand your mind!
5,i love you katharine jones BEST TEACHER EVER!!!!!
4.5,the class is too liberal  but the readings are interesting. average amount of work. I didn't like the papers  but she is VERY understanding. extremely nice lady and willing to help if asked. the class is set up as a discussion which makes it fun and interesting. papers aren't interesting  good class
4,nice lady  interesting discussions (most of the time). a lot of reading for each class but its not that bad. research papers (2) require a lot of work but overall not a bad teacher
5,Two huge papers...but i improved a lot on my writing with her help...keep up on your reading andyou'll be fine.
4,GRRREAT teacher  interesting lectures and very nice person....i learned alot from her and improved alot in my writing bbbuuuttt if ya take this class be prepared to work!!!..i dont regret it but as a design student it was REALLY tough to keep up with at times!
1,TERRIBLE  impossible grader  read EVERY clas and tons od research projects and work.
3,If you take this class you will have a ton of work  she will kill you on papers. This is definately not a class to take if you have a lot on your plate. Great teacher and interesting lectures at times  but if you are a design major with a lot of work  you might want to think twice.
5,best teacher ever england should have never let this one go!!!
5,SO ATTRACTIVE SO SMART AND SOOOOO BRITTISH WHAT MORE COULD YA ASK FOR!!!
5,She's brilliant and easy on the eyes.
2,freaky**** we had to study- it was too liberal regardless how open minded you are.
3,Hi  I'm Katherine Jones... Let me push my book in your face. It's fantastic.
3.5,Do not take this class  if you have any type of a life or do not like to read  cause that is all you will do in this class is read   you will learn a lot about Great Britain though  but I wouldn't recommend taking her
2,awful. would not recommend unless you are in running start and don't have a job. she says she goes over homework so you can have the right answer when you turn it in. not true. runs through class so fast and expect you to pick it up and repeat it back but unless u already have somewhat of a solid foundation in Spanish you will be left behind.
1,"If you have any other time commitments or don't have a good foundation of Spanish already then you are in for the worst class of your life. I spent about 2 hours a night just on homework alone  that we ""went over"" and it never helped because by the time you fixed a mistake in question 1  she was on question 8."
5,Very flamboyant  fun  and direct personality  which I loved. She is very serious about you taking the time to learn  but learning a language is hard and she is preparing you to talk  write  and even sing in Spanish. Attendance is extremely important and I would also recommend doing the extra credit which will help you towards the end to get an A.
1,If you have a full time job  and are taking three classes  do not take her class. The only people who have time for 3+ hrs of studying per night are running start students who have no bills or other classes! She barely responds to emails& You will not know your grade until the report after the final. Do not take this class!!
3,I love Christina a lot. Her classes can be demanding. If you miss  or skip  you're in for a world of hurt. Everyday is new subject material. Just do your reading  and do your homework  be prepared  and you can learn a lot. Her clarity was sometimes an issue  I was always asking other students (what did she say)?
1,This is the worst class I've ever take. New language is hard to start. Most of students had learned Spanish in high school but I'm not. She doesn't help me at all. I rather spend time with tutor than spending any miserable second in her class. Never recommend this class if this is the first time you start learning Spanish.
4,Never have I felt like I've been in high school while college until I took her class. She values class room participation and daily homework completion more than any other instructor I've had.
2,Although Senora Zahajko is a very pleasant and charming lady  she is very hard to learn from as a teacher. She expects you to spend 2-3 hours a day on homework  then doesn't even grade most of it so you don't know if you're getting it right. She zooms through new material and doesn't have time to answer students questions. Do not recommend her.
3,Have to work very hard. Attendance is a must. Lots of high graded HW. (I learn more by studying the material with HW as a guide  not doing hours of fill in the blanks) -A in 1 and B in 2 ( w all extra credit and it being my only class) Passionate  but needs to adjust her teaching style. Wish there was another daytime professor.
5,I have taken her class(Span & 121) a year ago  and now I am taking her second class (Span & 122). She is one of my favorite teacher in NSC. This is because I learned so many valuable things through taking her class. I am now speaking 4 languages including Spanish. Just take her class if you are interested in learning Spanish.
5,DO: Take this class if you want to learn the language. No other profesor compares. DON'T: Take this class if you just need to pass because you must work very hard.
1,Zahajko was the worst instructor I have ever had. She chose favorite students  had those students grade their classmates tests (absolute violation of privacy there)  raced through her lectures  called out the student she didn't like in front of the whole class  and was just plain rude. I absolutely DO NOT recommend her.
2,This professor is a joke. Aced all my tests  did every single homework assignment  but was given a 2.8 due to not being in class ever single day. If you want to take a class that reminds you of high school  then take her classes.
1,If you haven't taken Spanish before  then prepare to be behind on day one. Senora Zahajko moves quickly and doesn't pause for more than a minute to help anybody out. Daily homework is heavy and she is unsympathetic if you miss an assignment. Very biased to her favorite students and will easily single you out if you fall behind.
2,This class was a drag. I can't imagine anyone passing unless they took Spanish in hs. I took 121-122 and had 2-4 hours of hw EACH DAY. I even had to drop my other class just to keep up. The material bounces from one to another and it is very difficult to digest w/ her method of teaching. I highly suggest a study group. At least I got a high grade.
4.5,If you want easy A  she's not an option. but she's really an enthusiastic teacher and she knows what she's doing. There are a lot of homework and you're expected to turn them in but they're really helpful. She's quite generous in giving grades too and there are many extra credit opportunities!
3,If it weren't for the high school spanish class I took before  I would've done awful in this class. She's not the best teacher. I think you would have to spend a lot of time outside of class if you've never taken Spanish before.
4,If you want an easy A because you took high school Spanish  DON'T take her. If you want to learn how to speak Spanish  please take her. Cristina (no H in the first name)knows her stuff. She does assign a lot of homework. All homework is required to be turned in to receive a grade. She's tough  but she gives many extra credit opportunities.
4.5,"Sexc3xb1ora Zahajko's was an ""Intensive"" class so it only last 5 weeks  so you have to engulf yourself in the class. I enjoyed it  and having Spanish before I really appreciated her style. Shes culturally rich with info  and breaks the language down very well. DO NOT take with very challenging classes  as this will consume you with HW  but take her!"
3.5,She needs to reconsider her teaching style. She is very clear  but she rushes and the class doesn't have a lot of conversation practice activities.
5,Wang laoshi is honestly the BEST. I am so glad I took Chinese in Mount Holyoke because of all the amazing professors. Even though she is really busy  Wang laoshi  as one of them  is helpful  clear  caring and motivating. She is just like our mom.
5,Wang Laoshi is an AMAZING Professor. She effectively uses her teaching experience to the fullest  presenting the material in clear way. She makes sure her students not only understand but retain the information she gives. Also  she shares details of the Chinese culture which help illuminate the lessons.
5,She's intimidating at first and can be a little snappy when you clearly haven't done the work  but she's a spectacular professor and really cares about the students who are willing to put in the effort. The class itself is a lot of work and it meets every day  but you learn a ton from her.
5,I took Chinese and lit classes with Wang Laoshi and found she was a passionate  brilliant  empathetic and kind prof. She works harder for her students than most profs could even imagine. she always chooses fascinating material to teach in lit classes  and is structured and thorough in Chinese classes. She's just amazing
5,I've taken both Chinese language and lit courses with Wang Laoshi  and she's the most passionate and empathetic teacher I've met. She respects all her students and takes them for who they are. One of the most knowledgable profs in lit around  yet she seems to find herself learning from her students as well.
4.5,She expects you to work and work hard  but if you do she'll reward your efforts. She's not going to meet you halfway though. Very kind and encouraging if you seek her out for help or guidance. A really super professor.
4.5,I took contemporary Chinese fiction class with her and really liked it. The class was a good balance of lecture and discussion. There was a lot of reading (that was necessary to do) and there were 2 papers (5-7 and 10-12) and a 10 min presentation.
4,Wang Laoshi hugged me one day suoyi wo hen gaoxing!She is very understanding and helps you through Chinese if you're having trouble. She means well. everyone should go to Chinese table!
4.5,A very good teacher. However her choice in course materials is severely lacking. She's sweet and understanding. She moves the class quickly  which can be overwhelming at times. Fortunately the other two teachers move at a slower pace  so it all balances out. A good advisor too  if you're looking for one.
5,AMAZING PROFESSOR! She makes learning chinese seem easy... and its fun! She is very understanding when it comes to being overloaded with other school work and she's always willing to help you.
5,Wang Laoshi is an AWESOME teacher. I love this class  it's a lot of fun and I've learned so much. She is incredibly helpful and really knows what she's doing. It's definitely a challenging class  but it's well worth it.
5,Wang Lao Shi is a really good professor. She's more concerned with how you learn than how much you learn  though that is pretty important. She's very approachable  so take Chinese with her if you can!
5,SHE ROCKS MY WORLD!! She's very friendly  intelligent  and really cares about you.
5,Wang laoshi rocks!!! she cares about you and your learning  knows a lot about teaching languages. 6 credit course  hellish amount of work  but at the end of the year you speak AND read/write Chinese! Amazing  isn't it? (and the sweetest prof ever)
5,No Comments
5,Wang Lao Shi is great! She IS very approachable. She truly wants you to LEARN. Grades are just a way to gauge how well you are learning the material.
5,Wang Laoshi is very fair and approachable
5,Wang Laoshi is HOT!!!
5,I miss Wang Lao Shi! :(
5,Wang Laoshi is the best!
3.5,Took as an elective after a year of no Spanish classes. This is not an easy class. Plan for HW everyday including 2 research papers & 2 movie responses. He talks a lot  but that's good - you need to hear Spanish to learn. He's actually kind. Pop quizes. 2 exams-prompts in advance (: Ask questions in class! He will answer them thoroughly!
3,Moody. It's hard to rate him because one day he's wonderful (helpful and nice) and the next a total grouch (critical and nasty). He can be a tough grader  but if you show interest and really give it your all he's not too bad. I think he's a nice guy deep down  just moody. Show him that your serious and it goes a long way.
4.5,Professor Bell takes the class very seriously. Many people get upset with him because they take it for an easy A and it is certainly not one. That being said  he is extremely knowledgeable and you can learn a lot in the class. Just put in the effort and you will do well.
5,"He may come off as a bit mean  but it's really because he's strict. He's clear cut and he tells his students what to expect. You know exactly what grades you have in his class. Very organized. If you get to know him better  he will help you out. He looks thru BS and people who've ""scraped by."" Ask for help/advice and you'll get it."
3,Dr. Bell can come off as a difficult professor. However  if you express interest in the class and attempt to participate in group discussions  you should be fine. Def. go talk to him in his office and don't be afraid to ask for help. He also gives you extra-credit and rewrites on big papers which is fair compensation for the demanding work.
1.5,"We had an office meeting to go over my essay and he told me to my face that I make UMBC look like a joke because I should not have gotten this far I should change majors I don't have a gift for languages(I speak English and German fluently though..). not helpful at all very rude got mostly A's until him seems to pick favorites and ""not so luckies""."
1.5,I took this professor for a Summer Spanish 101 class. My experience was terrible. He tries to weed out the students that don't already know Spanish. If you get a question wrong he will insult you. If you ask a question he will insult you. If you forget an accent mark. The whole question is wrong.
1.5,Prof. Bell is unclear with directions and is very rude. The class is supposed to focus on culture in film
3,Naturally ego/rude guy  supresses it well. Tends to insult jokes  but benign onesr r Strict plan  cuts U offr r Teaching ability = goodr book = greatr pace = SO FAST  even ppl w/ exp hav troubler r Medium diff aside from pacer r DO NOT TAKE if first exposure to SPAN  or can't self-study  or if u miss >1 time. ~40% drop. Tech illiterate  figure yro
3.5,Very straightfoward with material  you know exactly what will be on an exam. Knows a lot about Spain from experience. A bit full of himself in terms of knowing things/opinions  interrupts students speaking a lot  and brags about his daughter a lot but he gets his points across. Study guides exactly what will be on exams. Just pay attention.
1,He's very rude  won't answer any questions  and is quick to assume the worst in his students. After this class  I'll never take a class with him again.
3.5,The class is very interesting with movies you would probably never have seen otherwise. Dr. Bell is very knowledgeable about the topics but it gets a bit boring. His lectures only last about 30 minutes though because you watch a film every class period. Quizzes are very hard  make sure you read!
1,This is by far the worst Spanish professor I have ever had and trust me I'm a Spanish student  I was beyond fluent prior to taking this class and I love this subject. He is rude  arrogant  cuts you off. He cares about maintaining his image as a hard professor and that's all. His grading is arbitrary and highly subjective. DO NOT take this class.
3,he is very knowledgable. 5 quizzes that he doesn't really prepare you for  but the midterm and final are both in paper form so you can make up for your grade there. definitely not an easy class  but it is interesting material and the films arent bad.
1.5,He made me dislike interculural films. He is rude & cuts students off when he doesn't agree with what his students said. I would NOT take this class. He does not explain himself well enough for students to understand. There are online chats and discussion board topics that are due every class. Also weekly quizes and 1 page papers due each class.
2,I would not recommend this First Year Seminar to anyone. Although the material sounds fun and interesting  too much busy work is expected from the course and its a struggle to get a decent grade. His lack of clarity when it comes to assignments creates numerous difficulties throughout the year. Consider this a warning.
2.5,This class was definitely not what I was expecting for a seminar. Bell is definitely a hard-ass. But if you follow the structure for this class  you should be okay  you'll just **** and moan along the way. You just have to regurgitate his opinions  and if you don't like a film  he doesn't want to hear about it  so keep your mouth shut.
1,I'm a senior and this is the first and only class I've ever had to drop! This professor is rude  demeaning  and belittling to students  not to mention misogynistic. Ladies especially  steer clear unless you enjoy **** comments. I loved Spanish before this class and now I'm hoping it hasn't been ruined for me.
2,very ignorant and arrogant...made my life miserable!!!
3,Had him for Spanish 303 and 401. He comes off as arrogant hecause he likes to boast about his education and his successful friends. Try to pay attention to the things he emphasizes  as they show up on the tests (at least  in 303). Although he is pretty arbitrary in his grading  he was sometimes flexible and willing to negotiate points on exams.
5,He is the best  for students who want to study. If you are lazy please take someone else. I took him online this semester spt2013 all I had to do is do what he asked and I received an A. Thank you or an interesting semester professor Vona.
5,Grad from class of 1983. Dr. Vona is by far the best professor I had at JJC. Very attentive to students who show a willingness and desire to learn. If you are willing to work and want to learn  take as many classes with Dr. Vona as possible.
1,PLEASE IF YOU NEED THIS CLASS TO GRADUATE take another professor. Right now I have no idea if I am going to even pass this class. provides no feedback  all the students are emailing each other because we are all failing this is a horrible professor. RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!
2,"I am a current student of his and I have to say that the man is convoluted  to say the least. He makes nothing clear  his grading system is a mess and he is not as responsive to students concerns with his class as you would hope. The text is informative  I will admit  but you won't ""feel right"" during or after his course...in MY opinion"
4.5,If you are looking to get a quick A without any work this is definetely not the class for you. This Teacher is really requiring students to increase their critical thinking skills. If you follow directions you'll do well. He does answer e-mails and he has provided a slew of information to assist you in doing your best. Excellent Teacher!!
4.5,Very pretentious and demanding yet it works out to your advantage. He expects you to follow instructions and actually think about what you're reading. His class will make you a better reader and student.
2.5,does not stay on topic very boring
4.5,If you are ready to work hard for your grade then take this class. However if you don't put a 100% you can forget about an A. In the end you would have learned something wonderful from both the course and the teacher.
5,YA Guys are crazy!!!! I just graduated from John Jay thinking that I was going to fail this class. To my surprise  It was not that bad. He is by far the BEST professsor I ever had at John Jay. He makes you work  and read ALOT!!! This is what will be expected of you in grad school  and the real world. He teaches straight foward  and explains student
4,i heard so much bad stuff about this man. it was all lies. his class is not bad he is very intelligient and no nonsense man. u have to read the book a lot of work but easy. TAKE HIM u will get a better view about criminal justice.
1,He thinks he is a dictator  and is going to take over the world. He looks down upon his students like they are nothing. Don't take CRJ425 with him take it with Prof. Sung  he is much better.
1,This was by far the worse course I had ever taken. Not only is this professor rude  disrespectful and confusing  but he has the audacity to insult people. I knew he was going to be a problem when I saw that he and Panzarella wrote the book
4,I am not going to lie but in the beginig
1,"I just dropped the course it was too stressful. He doesn't grade fairly and always criticize the papers. He yells  insults and treat students as incompetents. Cannot email him  and don't even try! All he does it talk  overall the class is boring  but he ""persuades"" students to have a high level of critical thinking."
1,Worst prof. I've had in my entire life! Heed the Warning! RUN 4 YOUR LIFE. He is awful. Does not provide u w/feedback & does not want 2 be bothered. He is totally confusing. I have not learned anything in this course. He does not want your input as to what u have learned. He works off a book he and Panzarella wrote together. Need I say more?
1,This guy is a ****. The class is very boring and the first two weeks all he does is yall at us. He grades you papers very****ty and he doesn't believe anything is wrong with that. Overall stay clear from this **** and take anyother professor. All he does all period is talk**** . THIS IS A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER WARNING! TAKE ANOTHER PROF.
1,This man is a nutcase. He is NOT clear as to what he wants  even though he gives you 25 pages to read trying to explain it. When you follow the directions as he clearly explains it  he still gives you a horrible grade. He also emailed the whole class five times in the first 2 weeks telling us all to drop the class. GET OUT... i warned you.
2,Obviously in the PSC department because it is a system of control.
2.5,Professor Vona: Is a very hard teacher. GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN and switch to Professor Hanson. PRofessor Vona is very unclear and an unfair grader. He follows a point system. GET OUT
4.5,Took Vona for Org. Crime in Amer. on-line. He seems very difficult but if you follow his instructions EXACTLY as he wants the assignments done then you'll do well - missed 2 assignments and 3 discussions boards and got a B+. There is A LOT of reading but it is a 400-level class.
4.5,I dont understand the negative comments  no midterm no finals just a short reading everyday and short writing assignment. Easiest A you will ever get in college trust me
1,Panzarella has the weirdest grading system and his lectures are long  boring  and irrelevant. A small writing assignment is due everyday but it is so easy. Although he is not the best teacher  this class is an easy A.
5,One of the best professors in John Jay! Professor Panzarella is a very knowledgeable man! The class is very informative! Professor treats everybody with respect!
5,Professor Panzarella is a very fair grader. Plus  he is very well educated person! I have learned a lot from the professor. The class was very informative. Professor treats his students as adults. Very interesting course. Not that hard. All you have to do is just read the texts. Loved this class!
3,Prof Panzarella is firm but fair. He lets you determine your grade thru attendance  quizzes and writing assgnmts. He gives no breaks and very strict but as long as you don't miss anything and complete all your work  you will do great. I had a problem understanding an assgnmt and he explained it to me so that I could understand it better.
1.5,One of the worst professors I've ever had. The guy is in love with himself. Home assignments are excessive. Lectures are filled with misinformation. The man is arrogant. Avoid if possible.
1.5,This professor is THE WORST PROFESSOR I EVER HAD. He gets off the subject and talks about other things for over an hour  he drops point on papers for the most stupidest reasons  his online quizzes are all screwed up  and he is definitely boring
1,This has got to be by far the worse professor ever. His teaching style seriously is the worse I've ever seen. He is not helpful  yes he may be knowledgeable but he will not help you if you need it. My gpa is a 3.88 and I work very hard  he makes it seem like this is his only class us students are taking. Believe me he is being reported!
1.5,if you are a full time student  good luck because this prof gives a ton of work as if this is the only class we are taking  asks for too much detail  and VERY picky with assignments and writing. if you can  save yourself and avoid it! also many students complained about this prof outside this website so  that should def be a sign!
1,avoid at all costs...
1,I am so glad I dont have to take him again.
5,This professor is great and gives a lot of real knowledge to the students  but he does give a lot of work. Thats the reason why students are giving him these horrible ratings  because they do not like to the work. He has a lot of knowledge of the Federal system...He's great
1,I must say he has been one of hardest educators I've ever experienced. The textbook he co-wrote is like reading another language and never learning that new language. He will definitely ruin your GPA. He is of no help and cares less if you learn or not. Students are unable to do well on the discussion boards & on quizzes even worst. Never take him!
2.5,I don't know where this guy thinks he is teaching. It's an online class and is insane! DO NOT TAKE HIM! This is not graduate school but is taught like it is  it's a 200 level course. It's like he hates student and gets them by assigning ridiculous work.
3,Panzeralla is focused on his own text books that he has compiled. He has no time for students  nor helping them. I have no idea why he is teaching at all when he has no interest in helping students at all. He does not respond to e-mails and if you want a response it is best you CC the Dean or Chairperson! Don?t take him!
2,This was the hardest class that I have ever took in my life. But I put in many all nighters and managed to get an A. Do not take this class with a full schedule. Stay away! The professor is a bit bitter at that. I am happy that it is all over.
1,All I can say is  do not take this class. I had to complain to the department about this professor and the course. If Blackboard shuts down the student suffers. The quizes and 150 word essays are graded unfairly. The professor is the worst. I am far from lazy or stupid. Eventually I dropped it to protect my GPA.
1,Worst professor ever. Told me i was bound to get a F when i could not withdrawal from the class.99% of the students could not do the work due to blackboard outage. how am i suppose to pass it with no work to be graded? DO NOT TAKE HIM.
1,DO NOT  I REPEAT  DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! The professor is the worst I have ever encountered in my life  and he has the nerve to call himself an educator. HE IS NO HELP AT ALL. I took it online  big mistake.. W. The text is very hard to read. The discussion board and quizez are set up ensure you get a poor grade. BLACKBOARD has constant outages.
1,Avoid! This class might prevent me from graduating. never thought a multiply choice test could be so hard or a undergrad text could be so difficult. The prof refuse to help if you have any problems and will refer you to the 10p syllabus if you ask him a question. The class is a gpa killer
5,Grades on a 10 point grading scale. He is so nice and always energetic and ready to teach! I would recommend him to anyone!
5,Great professor  explains everything with clarity. Literally what he talks about in class that's on the test. I would take him again.
5,I've had a class with Dr Janz before  and I took him again this semester. He's a great professor. I'm not interested in religion at all  and he explained everything so clearly and straight-forward that it was easy to remember and understand. Tests are MC + essay. Plus  he uses the canadian grading scale (80-11=A)  for an added bonus!
4,You can miss 2 or 3 classes a semester but by far the best part of this class is he uses the Canadian grading scale  100-80 = A!
4,Janz is cute. He makes terrible jokes and laughs at them which is really precious. No one really talked in class. No computers. He writes on the chalkboard and you write down everything he says. Class was pretty boring. Tests are difficult. MUST READ TEXTBOOK TO DO WELL. Canadian grading scale 80-100=A :)
5,Lectures are informative and enjoyable and tests are straight to the point. Very courteous to you if you have an impossible schedule.
5,janz is a great teacher  his class made me so relaxed and he's a great guy. He is very interesting and his class is not hard. take hiM!
4,He uses the Canadian Grading scale... need I say more?
4.5,Pretty easy. Tests are 10 T/F questions and one essay. He gives hints about what essay question will be. Dont have to buy textbook. Short readings. No quizzes. Uses Canadian grading scale- A:100-80
5,"He's an awesome teacher and he's so nice!! And he grades on what he calls the ""Canadian"" scale  where A's start at 80. He's great!!"
2.5,this class was really easy. go to class take notes. study for the tests [10 t/f one essay] 3 tests + participation grade. piece of cake...oh and A's start at 80
5,Dr. Janz is amazing and his wife is a very lucky woman! His class is extremely interesting and he's a sharp dresser!
4.5,I had Professor Janz for intro to religion. He's super nice  the class was easy  and I actually LEARNED the material! His tests are relatively easy  although he tends to focus on dates. Don't let that scare you-the only way to get less than a B in any class he teaches is by not coming or taking notes!
5,He is super nice  kind of boring to listen to. Attendence not required as long as you know someone who takes good notes. The tests are t/f with an essay  he is an easy grader
3,Three tests all T/F. Go to class and pay attn  and it's a breeze. Attendance not mandatory  so if you know someone who takes good notes you can alternate skpping class. Prof is really boring. Talks in a low monotone-like voice.
3,World Religions! Terrible Class so long and drawn out so many useless details but since we have to take it i guess this teacher was alright theres only 3 tests mostly from lectures
4.5,Nice professor. His tests are all T/F and there are only 3 total. No other grades
2,"Don't argue with him  just ""believe"" what he tells you and write about it. You'll do fine."
5,He's very nice  and he possesses a subtle sense of humor  so if you don't pay attention in class  you're missing out. Care to read another reason you should pay attention in class? Well  he gives three T/F tests per term  and many of the questions refer to seemingly random  unimportant remarks he makes in class. Paying attention+reading the book=A!
5,he is very nice and anything from an 80%-100% is an A
3,This guy's quizzes and tests are so ambiguous...not an easy class...i did poorly on everything and studied for each thing...
2.5,Pretty much an easy teacher  but can be a little tough if he's teaching a hard class
4,haha this guy cracks me up. Laugh at his jokes and ur his new best freind. Test are okay  i never studied and still did decent. if u study ur set
3.5,Stuey is the man! Very intelligent and knowledgeable  though he has a hard time making his point clear sometimes. Read the material and ask questions and you'll do just fine. Above all  participate and you'll do well.
2,No Comments
4.5,The easiest class at assumption. No homeowrk. The quizes and tests are very easy. They are everything he states in class  but at times can word the questions wierd.
4,Overall easy. Show up to class and things go all right. Sometimes the test questions weren't worded very clearly. Was somewhat unapproachable outside of class. He knows what he's talking about and seems like a good guy.
4,Excellent teacher  good lectures. However he is a hard grader and his tests/quizzes are difficult
5,Easy class we get out early and there is no homework except for studying for quizzes or exams. He has a short paper at the end. Lynn is very clear and easy to understand.
1,rambles uncontrollably. In general he is a nice guy but completely out of his league teaching accounting. He reads straight off the slides that are all posted on sakai & can barely answer questions. His whole section of the lodmod project is a mess and he cant even help you because he is using another professors outline. This class is a mess
3,This class wasn't too difficult. The exams are pure memorization so if you memorize the notes  its really easy to get an A. He is sometimes unclear in the lectures  but he really knows what he's talking about. Class was sometimes boring and attendance wasn't mandatory
5,very cool guy. lots of industry experience. EXTREMELY helpful. definitely remembers students names. I wish I could take another class taught by him. The class is straight memorization but work hard and it will pay off. and don't buy the textbook.
2.5,Boring teacher but he is very passionate about the class. Doesn't remember students names. Don't buy the text book because we don't use it at all. Tests are difficult and basically all memorization. If you study a lot you will be okay.
1.5,He is very boring  and he loves to tell jokes that are not funny. It is not helpful at all even if you ask him questions. The class and the tests are hard.
4,Nice guy  but hard grader
1,He is a horrible teacher
3.5,He is very boring at times. The class is hard and the test is hard. He willl work with you if you dont get something or if you have to make up a test. Doesnt remmeber his students names
3,Ok guy and an ok professor. The class is great and since he is the only one that teaches it you really have no choice. He knows what he's talking about and he tries to make it interesting. If you get into it  the class can be fun. It's easy no matter what.
4.5,Uses pwer points  class is boring  but he tells funny stories  tests are tough only b/c there is a lot of info to memorize
5,Very interesting  wants everyone to do well in his class  tries very hard to reach each individual student.
4,Very interesting class and he makes it fun. Reccommend taking the class!
4.5,No Comments
5,Lots of info  funny guy  can easily miss class and still catch up  webct rocks!!
3.5,No Comments
4,great teacher
1,unclear very boring  useless class
3,pointless information  stutters and babbles  hard to pay attention
4.5,really great teacher  he's very interested in the content he is teaching and is legitimately interested in his students and their learning. He enjoys getting to know his students and values content and concepts of writing over grammar. I hope to take another class with him.
5,No Comment
5,he's so enthusiastic it's amazing. and he's actually a good teacher who wants you to understand things! great!
5,He is a professor who is genuinely interested in the material he teaches. His teaching style is refreshing. He is genuinely interested in the performance of his students  and offers much guidance.
2.5,Before taking this class I thought the reviews would be wrong. But they are all accurate  she calls on you out of no where  collects homework days after it was due  grades unfairly. If possible  take a different section.
2,Took this class in HS and got a much better grade then than I currently am. Condescending in office hours/class and does not explain things well at all. Book is overpriced bc of its CD  but unfort. needed. Class is boring  but showing up is important. Likes to put quizzes on Fridays so you do. Overall do not recommend. Find a different section.
2.5,She frequently calls on you out of nowhere and often makes you feel stupid when you don't know the answer.
4,Tons of quizzes  and homework every class. A class where you definitely have to stay on top of things or youll get behind quickly. She is really nice  but sometimes not very clear. She tries to make class fun by doing activities  but most of the time it's not.
3,She really likes when you participate in class. Make sure you are prepared for class because it allows more opportunities to participate.
1.5,I am frequently made to feel stupid when I do not understand a concept or don't know the answer  but she never attempts to explain it or help me in any way. I had mono for a month and a half this semester and still managed to only miss her class twice. She was not at ALL understanding.
2.5,not the greatest teacher i've had in my life. dont really look forward to classes as they become awkward when no one answers questions and every minute seems like it goes on forever. Not really too helpful if you visit for office hours. Looking forward to the end of the semester.
4,Great teacher  you get homework... but they aren't hard and they actually help you. Get a quiz every Friday but they aren't hard and you don't need to study a lot for them. She is very helpful... i strongly recommend her
4,if you go to class with a good attitude and smile on you will be much better off. if you know the answer in class raise your hand and you will do well!
3,if u had four yrs of spanish in high school  it's pretty much review from it packed into 1 semester. not too hard but a lot of unnecessary work out of class. and most of the time  work that's due next day usually isnt even discussed until some other random day when u prolly threw it away thinking she wouldn't go over it & u lose class participation
2,i liked thought the class was easy  just a lot of time spent on out of class assignments which were not very hard  you just spend a lot of time doing busy work.
2.5,I wouldn't recommend Thompson. She moves extremely fast and is hard to follow along with. (Even after having 3 years of high school spanish). She randomly calls on people and often makes you look dumb if you don't know the answer. She's comes off as being a cold person for the most part.
4,She is a very hard grade and at some points might not clarify herself as much as possible in class  but she is always willing to help you one on one whenever possible. I highly suggest that you take her if you are up for a challenge and want to learn!!
2.5,Pretty easy class  but I also took 2 years of chem in high school (AP for one of those years). His tests are really easy  but he is a very picky grader. Boring lecturer  but I thought that he explained things well.
1.5,Nice guy  terrible at teaching. Does not teach  does not offer help  explains things incorrectly. If I hadn't taken AP chem in high school I would have failed. He definitely picks favorites and I'm pretty sure that he hates women.
1,Terrible teacher  he just drones on and on and talks about everything but chemistry. He's an analytical chemist so a very picky grader. He gave me a 65% on the first lab. I switched into Sokolik's and now I have an A. Get out of Pyzik's while you can!
3,I skipped almost every Friday and still made an A in his class. Not the best teacher but if you decide to put in the work its an easy class. All you need to do is go over his powerpoints and do the suggested problems.
1.5,Awful professor. Extremely boring and way too difficult. I really can't say I've learned that much from him. I've never put so much effort into a class and gotten nothing out of it  grade-wise or knowledge-wise
1.5,Worst prof ever. I basically taught myself everything in that course. HORRIBLE explanations! When I went in for help he seemed like he had no interest in helping me. I will NEVER EVER take a class from him again.
1,Worst professor I have ever had. He doesn't answer questions correctly and is useless when it comes to out of class help. He is disorganized and does not know the material he teaches.
2,Really nice guy  but can make things confusing  especially lab reports. Can make class fun though
1,Very nice man  but has no business being a teacher of any kind. would actually guess at answers to questions that i knew were incorrect. very boring class also. just read to us off a powerpoint. i learned 10 times more in high school chem.
3,Difficult professor.. did well in the class only out of spite for his teaching abilities
1,"Very frustrating professor. Never gave help when asked questions(""thats YOUR job to find that answer""). Very unclear  our class had to correct his mistakes! A nice guy  not so great prof."
3,he was hard and picked favorites. DO NOT GET ON HIS BAD SIDE!
3,No Comments
1.5,wanted to shoot myself in class....learned nothing...taught myself everything!!!!! you were such a nice man..but a bad prof...need to learn how to interact with college students more
2.5,Bad Explanations
1.5,Needs to be fired  lousy teacher  bad temper  what iss Denison thinking having this guy here?
4.5,"i dont think he ""needs to be fired""... liked him as a prof and learned a lot"
1,No Comments
5,No Comments
1,Very unhelpful in getting students to understand the material- he needs to be fired and is a waste of our parents money
4.5,really nice guy. Class kind of drags on  but he does frequently let you out early. Tough grader on papers. You should easily get a B- in his class.
4.5,He reminds me of my grandfather. I want to hug the guy. Gets confused easily in class  but helpful when you go to see him during his office hours. You can rewrite your papers if you dont do well on them too  which is a plus. Overall  not difficult to get at least a B+ in his class.
4.5,Easy-to-follow format but didn't get anything out of his classes. Grades papers really hard and writes the meanest comments on them.
4,Extremely nice guy. He is very old and gets confused easily however. Class can drag but is very easy and you only have to do a few papers and some homeworks. Hes very easy going and such a cute old man!!!
3,His class is boring and the homework has nothing to do with the papers. He is a very nice guy and will help you if you need it.
3,He was a really good teacher  it could get boring but he let us out early alot and if you do all your work you should do fine.
2,The whole class was taught off the internet. Count on this guy to bore you to death AND! give you papers that will take you days. The only sources for your papers are primary documents which were written hundreds of years ago and are hard to understand.
3.5,Some of the readings were interesting  such a sweet guy but forgetful and confused about who you are in relation to his class... so nice though definately worth the class.
4,Really good professor  lots of reading to do and its a heavily lecture based class but he tries really hard to relate to his students and makes you laugh a little too. overall good guy
4,The class is easy and interesting  however i found the online format hard to follow
4,Better be a democrat  the more liberal  the better!. He was OK  if you want a good Worc. Hist. class  go to Worcester State and take it with Jake Powers ( who doesn't mix politics in class)
3.5,Nice guy  however the online course for history is hard to follow.
5,"I have to admit Ellen's class is not the easiest but its only because she wants to make sure you get the material. For example  I got a bad grade on our last test BUT I was able to make up the grade by making an appointment with her and ""teaching"" her how to do the ones I got wrong. She is ALWAYS available for extra help."
2.5,She is a nice lady  but she is not always the easiest person to follow. It might not have helped that her class was only 50 minutes long  but I didn't really learn much during her lectures. I had to learn and figure out things on my own. The assignments were almost all consistent of MyMathLab questions that didn't do too much. But she is nice...
3.5,She is a great teacher  have to do the work in order to maintain a C or higher  the test are not that difficult because you can use a cheat sheet. Make sure you keep all your notes and papers she hands back because she does a binder check that is worth 50 points which can help your grade a lot.
3,She is an extremly nice lady. Her teacher is clear sometimes and not others. She doesnt teach everything in the homework so get it done before to ask questions. She lets you use a cheat sheet for her tests. Overall if you just do the homework and spend a little time you can easily get a B. Not to bad of a class. Gives extra credit to help you
3.5,She is really nice and her class is pretty easy as long as you do the homework. When she teaches she can be pretty confusing but overall shes not too bad. She tries to help out her students any way that she can. I would totally take her class again.
2,I feel this professor is not very efficient. She's a very nice lady and if you go to office hours or tutoring to ask her specific questions  one on one  she's helpful  otherwise she's not. I feel like I'll miss something if I don't attend class  yet going feels useless. The tests are nothing like the quizzes  homework or classwork.
1,The woman  needs help?! she cant teach  she confuses the hell out of you probably for her entertainment and then she gets chalk all over you and her if you sit in the front....you better study in her class and maybe youll get a C
4,I really like her. Shes very helpful and wants you to do well. She will also go out of her way to make a test review so you're prepared for the tests and exams. I WOULD take her again.
2,No Comments
1,cant teach
1,horrible
3.5,this class was ridiculously easy. just do the homework ahead of time so that you can ask her questions. the tests are simple
1,This woman is the worst teacher ever. she does not care who fails  all she wants to do is make your life miserable cuz she is miserable. i went to class regularily  attempted at her impossible hw  got A's on all labs  and did ok on the tests  but i still failed
5,No Comments
1.5,She often does the problems wrong in class which becomes very confusing. Also will not allow you to make up work even if you have legit reasons. Id suggest the MWF class rather than Tuesday and Thursday
5,Great teacher! Organized  well prepared class structure  and extremely helpful. You will not fail if you follow the pattern- Monday: Notes  Wednesday: Homework help  Friday: Quiz. Kind of kooky  but well worth your time.
2.5,I hated this class! Nice lady  normal college professor. I'm not great at math and I usually get a B  in her class  I struggled with a C. Quizzes every week stressed me out.
3.5,lectures kinda suck  lots of homework  but quizzes every friday right from the homework and easy ass math lab will keep your grades up. she's willing to help  even if she is a little weird.
3.5,She explains things well  but sometimes she will give the most complicated way to solve a problem. She goes over homework assignments at least twice before the quiz  and reviews just before the quiz. The only think bad is she is sometimes confusing  but if you tell her your confused she'll explain
1.5,She has very poor teaching skills.
4,I learned a lot from him.
3,Not bad for homework  but tests suck the big one. Very controversial questions. Will give a little on some questions but others will not even if he is wrong. Probably look for another teacher.
2.5,After yrs in many educational settings  courses of study  etc.  have not run into an instructor like this. Demeaning/disrespectful to students  frequent rants over minor infractions  hostile/stressful learning environment due to cantankerous instructor. Learning process stunted by instructor's erratic moods  class should NOT have to be this way.
3,I looked up to him when I started my paralegal studies. As time went I hated his class. He was never wrong even when half the class proved it on a test. Also don't piss him off because he'll drop you a whole letter grade just because he can. Nice guy if you like Hitler.
5,No Comments
2,His tests are God awful!
5,Of all the paralegal professor's so far (3 of 4). He is the best. He is the only one I learn from. Just like any teacher  you have to give them a chance and learn their teaching style. He will begin to grow on you. I am in this program to learn  and he is the only one that it helping with this quest
1,"This guy is nothing but an arrogant bully. You can contribute 100%  but one point off  and you still get low graded. Even the brightest ""A"" students hated this idiot."
1.5,I was bored out of my mind. It was a night class and I couldn't stand it. So  obviously I am not going for that anymore. I would recommend not missing any classes because you WILL get behind.
3,IF YOU ENROLL IN THE PROGRAM YOU WILL HAVE TO TAKE HIM NO MATTER WHAT. BUT A LITTLE ADVICE....MAKE SURE YOU TAKE GOOD NOTES AND HE WILL REPEAT THE INFORMATION YOU NEED TO WRITE DOWN. OH AND NO STUPID OUTBURTS HE HATES IT!
5,I am currently a junior student in his studio  and I could not be more happy of the fact that he is my clarinet professor. I was mediocre before I started my clarinet journey at WVU  and now I'm at a point I never thought I could reach. Yes  he does have high standards and he can be harsh  but it is to push you to aim high and improve.
4.5,He is strict  and a definite pain in the butt and kind of a jerk. However  as long as you do what he says and get your work done  then you will get really good at Clarinet. His teaching method is like magic.
5,Loved this Prof! He was one of the best prof's I have ever had!
1,Avoid at all cost
5,Kind of a pain in the butt  but one of the BEST teachers I've ever had. :-) A fabulous musician!
4.5,Awesome director of Chamber Winds!!
1,What a ****
5,he rocks! no bull**** with him  but that's real life folks...really helpful but you have to keep pushing yourself...go dr. weigand!!! :)
5,I was in his studio a few years back and I love him.
5,Dr.Wiggity is an awesome small ensable director. Great ideas and very helpful  those of you that think he is hot need help
5,I don't know what you're talkin bout but Dr. Weigand is waaay hot!
5,Ew...the not hot factor cause he's like older than my dad. Way talented teacher and if you get on his good side he will definately help you when you need it. If you like Basketball and hate marching band you'll be his fave:)
5,Mr. Tyson is hard. In the first 2 weeks of class  you're flunking  or you're catching on  & realize he requires dedication on some level to even slide. I took BIO at another college 3 times & dropped it. Boring. Tyson's grading required me getting on board. Suddenly  the subject & teacher changed everything. Almost 30yrs later  I still remember it!
3,Took biology 1 and 2 in 1999. I can say he had one of the classes that I learned a lot from. Taught a short creationism section along with everything. Was unique in that regard.
5,Mr. Tyson is an inspiration. If you plan to use any college degree for any area  you should take his biology course. While his daily tests are annoying & if you don't keep up  you're flunking by the 2nd week. But if you read the daily requirement you will have no problem with the simple tests. It prepares anyone how to study for a college cours
5,This professor gets your attention on what college is about. If you go into any med or science field  you need to take this guy. He will prepare you for MCATS  VCATS  PCATS. I would highly recommend this guy if you are going this route. Or even nursing. If you want a science for the hell of it  take someone else. I aced my bio part on my pcat
4,I really enjoyed Tyson. I found him very entertaining. His tests were difficult  but it just made the A I made all the more rewarding. I enjoyed the challenge. He is always trying to improve his class  and asks students for feedback on every test. Lectures not very interesting  I learned most of the stuff from the book. Overall good class.
1,wow he so hard!! and makes you feel stupid if you don't have to take him don't!!!!
1,Worst professor I ever had.......Didn't like him at all......And I like most people..
4.5,He's pretty tough  but it's not all his fault. STUDY  PEOPLE!
1.5,one of the hardest tests i've ever taken  makes you learn and remember a lot of info
1,DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN!!! He is so ... hard. If you want to do well your better taking someone else. His tests are extremely hard and analitical. I studied like crazy and managed to pull a C out of the class.
1.5,"he goes way to fast in the class  ""hands on"" isn't really hands on at all  you don't get to do****  he reads straight from the book. i loved biology till he ruined it for me."

4,I am glad he was my Capstone professor because I enjoyed his class so much. Most of the class involves group work  so find good partners on the first day. His personality is something you have to be prepared for  as he can be a little abrasive to sensitive people. Sometimes assignment reqs were unclear but he does everything to help you understand.
5,He was one of the best teachers I have ever had. He taught practical application in his class. He did not give you a grade that you did not earn. If you participate and do your work   you should pass.
5,The teacher is the best. You will learn a lot and makes the class interesting.
4,His class is awesome. It is very interesting & you learn alot of stuff you can actually use. There are no real tests in his class  just a lot of assignments. I'd take him for any class  but I think all he teaches is Strategy.
4.5,This cat is da bomb! We had a blast!!
4,An interesting class. It usually held my attention. Several of us tried to figure out what country he was from  but we couldn't. His accent was unique. His lectures are understandable  though.
5,Very professional instructor. Very knowledgeable on the topic that he teaches. I strongly recommend him.
3.5,Bowling is a good teacher  but isn't the best at making the class fun and interesting. this class is one of the topics that isn't the funniest  but you will have to take.
5,Ray is an awesome instructor  I had him for evidence. He fully explains the material and encorporates real life scenarios and experiences in his lessons. His only flaw is his bad taste in football teams..just kidding
5,Ray is awesome. Very understanding..
3,No Comments
5,Easy class. Just do the workbooks and you should pass the class. He has essays on some tests  but they were easy and straight-forward. Gives you plenty of opportunity for extra credit.
5,Mr. Bowling is such a wondeful instructor. His class is very easy and enjoyable. He lets you out early  his tests are  and he gives you extra credit availability. He is really nice and is willing to help with anything. Highly recommended.
5,Great Class   great teacher highly recommened
5,One of the finest instructors at Miramar College. He takes the time to ensure that each and every student understands the material presented and always treats the students with respect reguardless of their opinion.
5,He's the nicest man in the world!! He makes sure you understand the laws!! He wants you to be a good cop!!! He does everything to help you out!!
5,Great teacher  take notes and be involved and you'll pass.
5,He's a very nice man. And he always helps you on your tests. He tries to tell funny stories  but sexual ones make him blush. He's one of those cool grandpa types.
5,Dr. Milner is so great!!!
4,I absolutely love Dr. Milner. He is very passionate about teaching and learning. Class generally meets once a week with discussions and online tests  and there is nothing too difficult. If you want to be inspired  take this class!
4,Absolutely amazing. Take him if you can. His class is mostly online & meets about once a week. During class he more so gives life lessons & speaks from experience. He doesn't want anyone to fail. I've never had a prof who cares so much about their student's well-being. 3 online tests  online final  weekly discussions  & a few papers  that's it!
5,Best prefesesor I have ever had
2.5,He is so entertaining. He is so funny. But I felt like I did not learn all that much. We had a lot of in class discussion and it was based mostly on the chapter reading for that week. Weekly discussion questions on myclasses. He loves what he does and has a variety of experience which I thought was really cool.
1,He doesn't teach  he only gives tests based on reading. Then talks for an hour every class. He is not helpful at all  and doesn't respond to e-mails when you have questions.
3.5,Enjoyable class as he is very knowledgeable on the teaching profession. He doesn't regularly remind you of assignments but all due dates are in the syllabus so get in the habit off looking at it often. There are 4 online tests and 1 online final. Relatively easy grader.
3.5,I enjoyed his class. He is forgetful  and deadlines do jump out at you from nowhere  but he is fair. He listens to you  and if you need an extension  you got it. I love Dr. Milner.
3,Milner is terrible. He brags about being organized but never knows what chapter we're on or what we have due. He changes the class schedule all the time  is super condescending  doesn't teach towards tests or go over them  and assigns really stupid assignments for seemingly no reason. Don't take him if you have the choice.
3.5,This professor was a great one. I looked forward to attending this class every week. He really knows what he's talking about and is a great teacher. There is a good amount of work and it is mostly online but if you keep up with the workthen you'll do fine. Highly Recommeded
1,Everything Online. Never really understood when things were due or what our assignments were. If you turn everything in you will be fine. You just have to ask him multiple times when things are due. Really easy class  just a confusing Professor.
1.5,Probably the worst professor I've had in my college career so far! Doesn't keep track of grades and won't let you know until last minute if you are missing anything. My entire grade was changed because he tried to tell me my paper was late when it wasn't late at all. I would NOT suggest him.
2,Worst prof I've ever had. Really inconsistent grading  never keeps track of papers after you turn them in  and never fully explains assignments. Never makes himself available to talk or explain anything. Expects you to check your email every day but never responds to anything you send him. Also cancels/moves classes without much notice. Avoid him.
4.5,Great professor. I was considering changing my major until I took his class. Truly loves teaching and is very helpful. Expects you to know due dates in the syllabus. A lot of online assignments. Overall  a great teacher. Recommend for any class
4,All assignments are submitted online so you can use your book for everything- including midterms and finals!!
2,Milner is a great teacher and knows his stuff. BUT he is the most disorganized person ever. NEVER responds to emails. will admit he read them  but doesnt respond. He changes dates around  forgets what he assigned and when things are due - easy class  but I never knew what was going on!
2,Milner is not clear at all. I would not recommend taking an education calss with him. He knows what he is teaching  but always changes dates  and does not tell you what you need to do/study for the class.
4.5,He is one of the best teachers at Salisbury. He knows what he teaches  he loves what he teaches and he cares. He is by far and away a great teacher and I hope he keeps it up for a long time.
4.5,knows his material...easy class if you pay attention and read the assignments. ALOT of work at the end of the semester...had about 20 papers all at the last week because waited till the last minute....got a B..fun discussions
5,I agree with the last person. Milner is awesome. He makes the class enjoyable and I got a lot out of discussion. He teaches you exactly what you need to know to be an effective teacher but at the same time makes you learn it on your own. If you hope to be a great teacher take Milner. You will enjoy it!
3,Dr. Nelson was very passionate and loved engaging everyone on bi-weekly hikes. What I did not like was his attitude and the grading scale. He had good & bad days and they were unpredictable. Grading wise  7 genus and species identifying practicals and 7 quizzes were weighted the same. Entire class was out of 300 pts. Near impossible to get an A.
4,Dr. Nelson makes a rather boring class (I'm not interested in Botany) enjoyable and entertaining. It takes some getting used to  but don't drop in the first week. Be prepared to study every week for lecture and field quizzes  which seems like a lot  but it's do-able. Put in the effort and Dr. Nelson will see that and reflect it in your grade.
5,"This class is NOT easy  but Dr. Nelson wants you to do well. You will enjoy this class. It turns into a ""botany family"". Field trips every week (4hrs) & a quiz each day. You MUST keep up on your terminology & nomenclature to do well. This class requires work but is so rewarding. Dr. NELSON IS AWESOME! (Bio 526-528 I think) Take one of his classes!"
4.5,Dr. Nelson is funny  passionate about botany  & makes class interesting! Take field trips each week followed by a field quiz. EVERYTHING is cumulative  so Dr. N expects you to keep up with knowing the plants and botany terminology. As long as you study frequently  you will receive a good  fair grade. My favorite professor & class I've ever taken!!!
5,This class does require a lot of work because you have to keep up with new plants learned every week in lab (lab= going outside to state parks  etc.). I was really overwhelmed at first  but it ended up being manageable and if you put forth some effort you can get a good grade. Nelson is so nice and fun  and I enjoyed this class overall.
4,This class does take a lot of time and work but I believe it was all worth it in the end. Dr. Nelson is a very smart man and normally pretty nice  he does have his days though. The semester project takes a lot of time and you should start it as early as possible.
3.5,This class requires as much studying and class prep. as does Organic Chem. You will have a quiz every class. You have a huge plant collection to do on top of large comprehensive exams. I learned a great deal in this class  but still would not recommend it unless you are a work-a-holic
1,I'm a senior and this was the worst class I've ever taken. I chose this professor because he had good ratings here  but they haven't been updated in a couple years  because something must have happened to turn this guy into a total prick. He is mean  unhelpful  and just downright rude to students. !!!NO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!!
4,He is picky  but his class his fun and interesting.
4,This class was very interesting and definately unforgettable. I really hate plants  but he makes it fun and the field trips make class go by pretty fast.
5,GREAT professor! Loves to teach. Classes are a lot of fun. His spring flora class was one of the most memorable classes I ever took  even though it was pretty hard (But what else do you expect from an upper level course). I would definitely recommend him!
5,One of the few actually good teachers at this university. He might take a little getting used to but he is very available and willing to help. He knows the stuff and is good at explaining. It's best not to talk in class unless asked. The field trips are good but the class has too many students.
3,His tests are pretty picky and his lectures are boring. Take good notes and study for days before the test!!!
5,Dr. Nelson is a great teacher. His class was interesting. Make sure you go to take notes because the tests comes directly from the notes. He put parts of old exams in the library on reserve  make sure you get those bc the exact questions will be on the test. If you study you should do well.
3.5,No Comments
4.5,Tests cover a lot of information. Take really good notes.
3,He trys to be entertaining. The class is boring. The tests are hard. If you take this class be ready to study your butt off cause the tests cover like 150 pages+ each.
4.5,A lot of information but not too bad. He's a really nice teacher and willing to help out his students no matter what.
3.5,No Comments
5,Very good teacher. Very clear and precise at explaining everything. Be sure to take excellent notes because the whole test is from them. I recommend purchasing a tape recorder! Weighs heavily on plants since he is a botanist. Doesn't do much animals.
3.5,Typical writing of papers every week. Kind of interesting when she went off on tangents. Not her fault that critical reading is very high school. I would take her again.
4.5,She was defintely the best teacher I've had so far at Loyola. I wrote a poem and wanted her to just critique it (it wasnt even an assignment) and she read it at a poetry reading. She picks out great material to read and is extremely laid back. She really knows how to relate to her students.
4,she was so easy  its not even funny. i didnt do some essays  and she gave me A's for them. im pretty sure she was high half the semester anyway. but a really nice hippie
5,She's one of the best Loyola teachers
5,she is the so great! very helpfull and a loving personality! I'm even taking her 122 class for spring. ( its hard to get in her class b/c it get filled quikly so hurry if you want her) strongly recommend her !
5,She is awesome! I had her for summer bridge- and what an amazing teacher to have as an entering freshmen at Loyola. Makes writing such a defined  clear process. AWESOME AWESOME TEACHER!
4.5,God  she's the best professor in the world. She
5,Best English teacher I have hever had! Really made me open my mind and think in new ways.
5,She is the sweetest lady. She offers extra credit and grades easy. She is very clear about tests. One question quizes. A great teacher. She is a real person.
5,She's a great teacher if you know how to take what she's offering. She picks great stories to read and discusses them more intelligently than any other English professor. She's a little ball of joy and when you talk to her it always rubs off on you.
4,Very easy.Love the stories.Other books are very easy.Testa are essay but isnt hard because she lets u pick questions the class before the test.Love her class.Class discussions are good but gives very very easy pop quiz if no one reads.
5,SHE IS AWSOME  A GREAT ENGLISH TEACHER
5,She I didn't just give her the best ratings because it's easy  she is an amazing person and makes herself more of a person than a professor
5,Very easy - just be nice to her and she'll love you. She has a little bit of ADD but is the best English teacher ever - her classes are extremly hard to get into - but so worth it!
3.5,She is great! A bit random at times but her class is very easy and she is very helpful. Definitedly take her for common curriculum!
5,AWESOME AWESOME  TOTALLY! Be aware that she does make you think but for paper revision conferences she goes step by step with you when making corrections.
5,She picks great material for you to read and her lectures make you love it more. I read a lot more these days thanks to her.
5,Teacher is adhd and tells you! She's awesome and is like this course should not be hard. Her test are open book and she gives you the test to print out and write notes on.
5,She's a great teacher. She's very nice and funny. The books are easy reads and its very easy to get an A in the class. The essays are not bad. I recommend her for anyone taking any of her english classes.
5,shes awwwsome. laid back  really funny and realizes that how other teachers teach literature sucks it dry and makes us reallly board. shes got an awsome attitude and you look forward to going to her class.
5,MB was probably the best teacher I have ever had and SMC is idiotic to have let her go. Her classed were definitely some of the hardest (read: most effort necessary) in my years at SMC  but she taught me how to become such a better writer. She deeply cares how her students do. Do the work  accept criticism and improve based on that criticism.
3,eh it was ok
4,redmond is intelligent  experienced in her field  knows what she's talking about. the class is a lot of work but you learn so much. id totally recommend her!
3,I'm sorry  but I despise this woman. She is part time and brand new. She must play TOTALLY by the rules because she is new. I don't think she will ever get off her high hourse. I just want her to go back to where she freakin came from. Despise her.
5,Great teacher  but the class is so boring. This could have been an online class. YOu need to come to class or you will fail.
1.5,This guy is a joke. Sooo BORING!! Useless information.
1.5,This guy is a joke. Sooo BORING!! Useless information.
1.5,t
4,Easy class. Tests are online  so open book. Gives some of the essay questions ahead of time. Speak up in class once or twice and you will do great.
1,his class was a waste of my life. take someone else
4,This class was so easy as long as you paid attention in class and participates you will pass. his lectures are boring and consist of like a billion slides which you dont have to pay attention to because they are online. overall a very easy class
4,Nice guy. Tries hard to make it interesting  but it's still a snooze fest. He does show plenty of little videos and commercials to break it up a bit. Test are straight forward and right out of class discussions/lectures. Go to class and pay attention  you got an A. Want someone to give you an A for being alive  enroll at phoenix or JU.
5,The presentation is a BIG part of your grade  but you work on it for most of the semester. It really isn't THAT big of a deal since it's not all due at once.
4.5,hes cool. act like you want to learn something and you probably will. test are online and he will help you through his project if you ask. class can be slow but again participate and all is good.
3.5,international marketing was horrible. the project sucks. it will consume your whole semester. he is the only teacher for international marketing so have fun. he is a tool in class but nice in his office
4.5,The class kind of drags on a bit. The professor covers most everything on the test in class  but you will have to study for his test. Do all the assigined work and study guides.
4.5,Easy...if you do the work.
4,Class goes by a little slow but he is a nice guy. His projects are very open ended but he is pretty helpful. Has a good sense of humor.
3.5,Good teacher willing to help outside of class. Very easy  even though the project may seem difficult at first it really isn't bad.
2.5,Too boring
3,Boring. Didnt really stimulate my thinking. Read material straight off powerpoints. Nice guy  but bored me. Class is relatively easy.
3,Don't buy the book. Tests are from PP.
3,Everyone gets at least a B on group project. Sketchy grader on Essay Questions. Very nice though.
1,Bring a pillow and a book  this class is sooooo boring!!!Its not that hard but he is very unclear with his instructions and his lectures drag on. No need to get the book  just print out the power points becuase thats what the tests are on.
5,if you read your texed book you'll get an A
1,She doesn't really teach she just goes over projection notes that she's made. However  she does give you copies of the notes which help when trying to study. But in order to pass you have to pay some serious attention.
1,she cannot teach she is the worst professor ever and she is old.
1,She isnot good for ESL student. If you are ESL student then forget it. She is good in lab  but in lecture she is ok. She explains everything using projector. So for her it's easy  for us it is very hard.
4.5,i hated her at first but as time passed by i began to like her. she is a good teacher and knows what she is talking about. She is open to questions. Pain in the neck about open-toed shoes in lab and attendance in both classes. she is friendly and cares for her students. I went from failing her class to getting a B+.
5,I took her class this spring. Even though her class was not really easy  if you study hard  it won't be problem to get good grade. SHe cares about her students a lot  and helps students how to study. She is a very good prof.
5,I took her class in fall 2004 as my first semester. at first she seems hard and her tests are hard infact  but she is very helpful and nice. her tests are exactlly what she talks about in class and her notes+ your notes that are taaken during the class and from the book. she is such a nice lady.........
5,No Comments
3,Very tough teacher  if you have taken the pre-reqs and paid attention  you should do fine. This isn't high school people  take some responsibility for yourselves.
2.5,Be forewarned this lady is hard  The other reviews are right she does look at you like you are dumb at times when you don't know something. The class is hard and her test are impossible.
1.5,This was my first semester @ college and i got her as my prof...oh my gosh its like being in a nightmare in her class...
1,No Comments
2.5,She is nasty. She is very unhelpful  if you ask her for help she makes you feel like a moron  like you should know if you're in a higher than third grade class.
1.5,in lab she is very nice but not in lecture. she doesnt explain everything in the students evel. she talks very sophisticated. and is very boring cause all she does is talk and point.
2.5,Lets TA's do all the work. Not very helpful to students.
4,margo is a great teacher...170 is a class that the ta's teach to get experience and it's too big for her to teach every1. do the work and u'll more than likely get an A. b/c the grads really want u to pass. 370 is a class she teaches and if ur passionate about acting take her. i really learned alot.
3,she's ok. She lets to the TA do everything  so it really depends on the TA you have as to wether you like it or not. Basically show up and you'll do ok!
5,No Comments
3.5,You have to get on the good side of Margo. If she likes you  she will basically give you a good grade..if she doesn't like you  you will probably get a bad grade no matter what. Most theatre classes are basically about coming to class and participating- so that is what she will expect of you.

5,Really wants his students to do well. Lectures are long and wordy but you will do well if you go to class.
5,I really enjoyed the material taught in this course. Meshaw truly wants his students to do well in the class and gives everything needed to get a good grade. Class attendance is imperative to get all the information covered in the homework and quizzes  but if you show up  you'll have everything you need.
3.5,Easy class  scattered professor but effective. Miss a few weeks & you will suffer in the class. Miss once & you are ok. Quizzez & fill in the blank tests are covered in the class  so you know exactly what he wants to see... Just show up  take decent notes & its a pretty easy A
1,DO NOT TAKE MESHAW. He does not teach anything and he mumbles so badly  you cannot understand anything he says. He simply uses class time to go over the cases in each chapter and the homework. His tests are very very difficult. Instead  take this class online at FSCJ!!!
1.5,Tests were pretty tough. All he does in class is go over homework  doesn't teach anything. Homework has nothing to do with the tests. The class average was so low he let us take the third test home  and still most people thought it was too difficult.
4.5,Study his examples and you won't go wrong with his tests very straightforward. The essays on the tests are not hard. Go to his office if you need him for help. Nice professor take him if you can.
2.5,essays easy. overall great class. Take him you won't regret it.
2.5,Very boring professor  his exams are half essay  half multiple choice. His only classes seem to meet once a week  avoid missing classes. Very poor time management  with holidays  we got to the final week with 10 chapters of material left. Extremely difficult to get in touch with as well. Take Schupp.
4.5,Easy class. Knowing the cases that will be covered before had really pays off. Know his examples. They will be on tests. He throws no curves  and is concerned with his students. Excellent way to brush up/get hours for the CPA exam.
4.5,Assignments are a breeze. There are only 3 test and attendance that are part of your grade. The info is mostly from the book with multiple choice and short answer. He is a nice guy and you won't mind going to class.

4,Solid professor  Attendance & Lateness is key. Get there on time and pay attention  you'll be fine. Not the best but not the worst either.
4,Professor Karras is stern and speaks in a monotone manner. He didn't show much of his personality. He's a reserved  fair guy. Pick your karate partner wisely because you'll be stuck with them all semester. My partner had a nice body so you know I was chillin :^D There's no flying kicks in this class. It's mostly defensive grappling maneuvers
4,Wasn't really sure about karate at first never took anything like it but this professor gets you through everything you need to know for every part of the semester. Anything you need to see he'll be glad to show you again and gives you all the review in the world for the final.
4,Theirs a written midterm which he basically tell you all the answers to the class before and a final. for the final you have to perform all the moves you learned through the semester. I thought I was going fail because I could never remember any of the moves from the class before but he let us record him doing the moves & i ended up getting an A
1,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!! Worst class i have ever taken. First off the class is located in the colleges wrestling room which smells absolutely terrible and the mats are infected with a skin fungus known as ring worm!! He makes you stand infront of class and perfom kerate moves  embarrasing!! He can be very irrational. And rude. STAY AWAY!!
1,Very rude. If he doesnt like you you're better off not asking anything. Good luck with this stand up guy lol
5,I was very hesitant to take this class but honestly Prof Karras is the best. He really knows his stuff and is willing to help anyone who asks for it. There is a midterm and a practical final  but every technique is clearly reviewed and gone over multiple times throughout the semester. Take karate with this prof  you'll have fun and won't regret it.
4.5,Professor Karras' class was very easy as long as you show up. Very good instructor and very helpful when asking to review techniques again. The only downside is you have to work with a partner and if you get stuck with someone who doesn't want to put the effort in they make the class more difficult for you.
4.5,He was intimidating at first but as time unraveled he turned out to be a cool guy. When he explains his demos he is very deliberate and clear. He is also willing to go over something you missed. My favorite thing about him was that over the course he would give little life speeches about maintain awareness. Very Nice Man and I overall learned a lot
2.5,at first it was interesting. in the beginning of classes we have to mediate. we are not allowed to have necklaces of course you cant have jeans. he assigns you with a partner to study the karate moves
5,Prof. Karras teaches very concisely and has a well-organized curriculum. If you pay attention to the moves and show up to class  it's an easy A. You're graded based on your participation  midterm (multiple choice T/F) and final (practical exam). He's strict about attendance - even dropped a few students during the last week of class.
2.5,i put hard work into it got a 95 on the midterm and he still gave me a B
5,Great Professor. It's not the easiest class  but if your willing to put in the effort you'll do well.
5,Excellent professor! If you're not serious about the class then you will not do too well  but as long as you follow his instructions  don't miss more than 3 classes  and pay attention  you'll be fine. If you have any problems with any moves  he'll help you out until you get it.
2.5,ummm can some give  e his email address
5,Great class. Great Prof.
3,Okay so most people take this just for the credits  and thats all. He goes too hard
2,I HATED this class. Please run for the hills!!
3.5,hes pretty clear and patient with his students. Hes a very serious guy and you cant talk in class or that will deff sway your grade trust me... is it an easy A.. no but if you pay attention dont talk go to every class and show a lot of interest and get the moves the way he wants it then it will be..
5,VERY INFORMATIVE. VERY PATIENT. AND WILLING TO HELP. ATTENDANCE AND DRESS CODE ARE MANIDITORY. LOVED HIS CLASS
4,A really nice prof  but definitely expects you to work and practice hard. He seems to really understand everyone's level of commitment  and teaches accordingly. Only negative point is that he doesn't say too much  so you have to ask him if you want an a specific answer.
5,SO HELPFUL. oh my goodness! He finds ways to help me in between lessons! i was struggling with my tremolos for months and he said like 1 sentence and that fixed the problem. Great teacher!
1,not helpful at all. never enjoyed his teaching and I was not the only one who thought of this.
5,In a word: YAY!
3.5,No Comments
1.5,This guy doesn't care much about teaching. I could just go on and say the same thing everyone else did  but I won't. He has accomplished alot in his life and now he's making money on the side for talking about it to a class. I learned nothing for this class  although I was happy with my grade. I've never had a teacher cancel so many classes.
1,His favotite subject: Robert Ware....RUDE and cancels class without much warning. Very unprofessional. Doesn't reply to emails.
1,Its unfortunate that a professor teaching a professional MBA program can be so incompetent. He came to class without any type of plan  and to make matters worse  he seemed to think it was perfectly acceptable to talk about himself the entire 4 hour class
1,Wow  what a jerk. He treats you like an idiot online and is not helpful. He makes you feel like he is way to busy to bother with you.
1,He only has you do a few writing assignments  which isn't bad but he's very unclear. He definitely doesn't follow his syllabus and threw in a surprise Final at the end after saying we were done w/ work  wasn't cool at all. Plus he graded it harder than any other paper bringing down my grade big time
1,Everything you hear is absolutely TRUE. Very bad teacher and full of himself.
1.5,He brags about his accomplishments a lot instead of covering material that needs to be covered. He is always at least 15 minutes late to class  but if you leave he holds it against you. He loses assignments frequently and won't take fault  even though there are 10 people with missing assignments
1.5,If this class had been for law students  and a full year it would have been fine. But important sections of business law (commericial paper  life and death of a corporation) were ignored in favor of Consitutional law and current events. If you take him be sure to read the whole book.
1,Ware is the worst teacher I have ever encountered. At a Master's level I think everyone is aware how to site a paper. He spends too much time talking about about his accomplishments and how much he has been discriminated against. Grow up and talk about the subject matter!
2,This professor does not practice what he preaches. Grading system and requirements were constantly changing. Very poorly prepared for class and time spent in class not properly administrated. Spent too much time bragging about himself vs. teaching the class topic
1,Quite arrogant and doesn't entertain any opinions other than his own. Admittedly subjective grader. Changed requirements with LITERALLY no notice. Only thing he'll help you learn in class is that he A. went to Harvard B. worked for Reuters C. has a law degree PhD. You'll hear it ad nauseum.
1,All about me me me me ... Terrible teacher. Needs to learn to teach. He seems to have met all the top CEO's in his impressive career  but forgets that we really do not care unless he can impart some knowledge.
1,Impressive educational background overshadowed by his arrogant attitude. VERY full of himself. Pretentious and disorganized. No substance in his classes. He might have valuable experience but it's no good since he just can not teach. It has been a dissapontment to have him as a profressor. A V O I D
2.5,Pompous  arrogant  disorganized. His disorganization may work out in your favor...only one test  then a presentation for final. Much busy work. Does not care for opinions other than his own  although he asks for participation. Avoid!
1,Horrible  Rude  arrogant  scum professor. i wouldnt recommend him for anything .
4,Once you get past the bragging and pompous attitude he is actually really nice. Class is not too difficult and set up so you learn more than just hearing lectures all the time.
1,This was the poorest attempt at organizing a class that I have ever seen! Changed grading criteria with no notice. Sent rude emails that did not answer the question. Didn't know how to use the online system. Bragged about law & PhD school every class.
2.5,Ware is rude!! Does not follow his schedule  very opininated  if your opinion isn't the same as his  you are wrong and he will make you feel really stupid. Likes to brag a lot about anything and everything. Tests are hard! lots of busy work
1,Online course. Posted NO course info until 3 weeks after course began. Sent rude and generally incomprehensible emails. Moved up due dates without notice. Repeatedly mentions that he went to law school. Brand new & already a horrible professor.
5,Love  love  love Dr. Wall as a teacher. I have had her for several classes in my graduate program. She is VERY well organized with class content - there is no way to mess anything up or not to understand what is expected. I love that she uses Schoology for the class setup - it is a million times better than D2L. Wish I had her for undergrad classes
3.5,This class is a definite GPA booster. About half of the time you won't even be in class the entire time. If you have questions  she answers them fully. The course layout was very easy to interpret.
5,Super super easy class!!! There is hardly any homework in this class. Basically what you don't finish in class is your homework. She makes the assignments pretty short and easy. She doesn't grade hard at all. Just show up and do the assignments and group work (worth 20 points but super easy) then you will pass easily!
4,Extremely easy class  just do the work. Dr. Wall is really nice and knows what she is talking about. Assignments were not hard unless you're not good with technology. A lot of group projects.
4,Very easy class  but she can be a bit rude. Class consists of busy work and a few projects which you will have plenty of time to do.
5,This class was very easy. If you missed class its fine because she records the class. She goes straight to the point which I loved because I never stayed the whole time she usually finishes in about 30 minutes then you can do whatever you want.(which also means leave) Some class periods we did stay long on some of the more challenging topics
5,Awesome professor. She is super nice and very knowledgeable when it comes to technology. Class consists of a lot of busy work but nothing that is hard. She shows you lots of amazing free web-based resources that will be very helpful in the future classroom. Definitely recommend Professor Wall.
5,One of the easiest education courses. She tells you exactly what to do and how to do it. Follow her directions and you will be fine. Lots of busy work to do but if you stay on top of it it is easy.
5,Class grade is mostly the projects which require a lot of time but are very useful to the real classroom and for the most part are interesting to do!! Dr. Wall is very helpful and one of the nicest teachers I've had!
5,Really wonderful professor. The class projects do require a lot of time
4,Dr. Wall is an amazing professor! She makes technology easy to understand as well as fun!
1.5,I have her for a summer class  and she didn't make the class even close to summer friendly!!! We had to do the exact same amount of work that the sixteen week class did and was almost totally non explanatory  but expeted us to damn well know! DO NOT TAKE HER FOR A SUMMER CLASS!!!!! You'll want to commit ritual suicide!!
4,Dr. Wall is a great teacher and she's really nice. The Education 3040 project isn't difficult but it is time consuming. She provides plenty of class time to work on the project and is always willing to help.
5,Dr. Wall is one of the greatest professors on campus  she's very helpful and she knows her stuff! The class is very interesting and it's very useful toward teaching-finally a class you don't feel like you waste your time taking.
5,Great teacher! loved every minute of this class.
4,Dr. Wall is wonderful and explains things very clearly. She is very strict on attendance though... make sure you are in her class every day or if you do have to miss it make sure you have a good excuse. Overall this education class was wonderful and she knows her stuff! I would recommend her!
5,The nicest and most helpful teacher that I have ever had. There is a lot of work to do but she explains it so well it really is not that bad. You will have to do the same amount of work in this class whether you take her or not. But in my opinion you could not get a more helpful professor.
5,The absolute best prof I've ever had. If I could have taken her for all my educ classes I might not have swithched majors. Go to class and pay attention which isnt hard because she makes it interesting.
5,WONDERFUL teacher! I would recommend her to anyone. The project is the most important part of the grade so stay up on it. She will help you in any way that she can. She treats everyone the same and grades you by how hard you work. Anyone who says that Dr. Wall is not a good teacher has a severe attitude problem!!
5,Dont listen to the person who said she was bad. Dr. Wall is an excellent teacher who does everything in her power to make you understand what she is talking about.If I could take Dr. Wall for every class I would be very happy. The class is awesome and its fun to boot. Take Dr. Wall  she rocks.
3,She is very hard to understand and that puts a damper on the interest level of the class. However  the professor that took over for her this semester is very clear and easy to understand. Explains things better. She is also pretty hot too
2,Even though i got an A in this class it was a torture to go to every single class. She was so unprepared and unorganized. She was confusing and went on and on about one slide forever. She was hard to understand and so boring. Nice lady but if i had known i would have taken the class with someone else I learned nothing. Terrible professor.
2.5,Really nice person  terribly hard language barrier. BORING Class! Easy if you follow study guide. Really nice person but not a teacher I would take again.
4.5,I recently finished taking a course w/ Prof Rodriguez.She is a very good professor who is well prepared for class and brings interesting material to be discussed. Much of what she teaches can be applied after walking out of class. Her accent does not effect her teaching ability. Overall great  helpful  and understanding Professor. Class recommende
5,She was very prepared  thoughtful and stimulating
5,I loved this class and look forward to talking another course with this professor in the future. She's an incredibly nice and understanding woman.
1,Language barrier very tough. Very nice person  awful tests. Would NEVER have taken had I known.
1.5,Can't understand a word she says. I don't attend any of the classes and manage a B on the exams. I suggest not taking a class with this professor if you would like to understand the material the first time its taught.
3.5,Her accent is not that bad once you get used to it. Though she is adorable and extremely nice she can sometimes put ppl to sleep. She is really passionate about the subject and she's a really great professor. You don't need to go to class just txtbk website and its pretty easy after that.
5,She's a great teacher and keeps the subject matter interesting!
2.5,Very intelligent professor. Hard to understand her  shes really good about putting up test grades now. all notes are posted online. dont really need to go to class. no attendance. good for GPA if your psyc savvy.
1.5,Very boring teacher! I was interested in psychology a lot before I took this class  but because she bored me to death in class  I could care less about child development now. You do not need to go to class  just print out the slides. She is really disorganized with her notes and takes forever to post the grades.
2,Notes and text contradict one another  takes her forever to get through one slide  don't even bother trying to understand her  notes online which is helpful
2.5,This class was actually very easy  and the TA was amazingly helpful. Although she gave long notes  they could easily be shortened simply by using your own words. She gave us study guides for each exam. Very easy class. She does  although  have a strong spanish accent  but she is willing to repeat herself if needed.
2.5,Not a terribly hard teacher  or one that will change the way you think  but it's nice to have a class every once in awhile that's simple and straight forward.
2.5,"Speaks with lots of ""um""s and ""uh""s  which can be distracting and frustrating."
4,Class is interesting regardless of prof  but she is sometimes difficult to follow with her accent (not her fault). Class is easy if u go to txtbook website (book itself is not really necessary).
3.5,multiple choice right from the book
5,She really cares about our grasp of the material and tries to make us enjoy it. She may not be as rigorous as others  but she definately holds us accountable. I have really enjoyed having her as a professor  she is so knowledgable and really makes us think.
5,cares so much about her students. Unlike many profs she wants students to do well. material is interesting& She covers material very well her notes are very clear she also posts her notes online which is helpful. Shes always willing to help a student as long as they ask. 1 of the best prof. I've had
4.5,He is an okay teacher. Yes  he knows the law but is hard of hearing and boring.
3,He is a good professor. I just wish he understood that if you have a hospital note  you must have been very ill.
5,No Comments
5,Awesome prof. Learned a lot about the law that I didn't know!
4.5,Excellent knowledge of law and cases relevant to education.
1,the proverbial one trick pony. typical never built a thing professor.ask to see his work. its laughable...
2.5,No Comments
1,if you want an egotistacal teacher with a napoleon complex  he is for you. he has very little practical experience and it is very evident.
4.5,great at pushing you to do your best. a great teacher overall  although very blunt and sometimes unfair. excellent at conceptual ideas.
5,simon knows his stuff  he is more interested in opening students eyes to other forms of architecture  and other approaches to the creative process. the work is demanding  but if you're interested in arch. you'll be excited to try new things. he is also ALWAYS available  and you can call him ANYTIME
2.5,Simon is a very difficult and demanding teacher. If you take him don't plan on getting much sleep or having much time to do anything else besides design work (not even your other school work). He is extremely abstract and does not accept traditional style designs.
1,SIMON COWELL
2,an odd sense of humor- will tell u that u're failing to make u work better. makes u redo ur work
5,He was very helpful  very interested in your own opinions and those of the class. He was good at trying to find your strong point and evaluated you based on what you do best and what you tried to improve. Because of him  I <3 collages.
1.5,Don't get me wrong  Ellie is probably one of the nicest and most interesting people I've ever had the pleasure of meeting  however her lectures are confusing! She provides very little structure and tends to get off topic (a lot) when teaching Lacan. Chances are unless you're a grad student  you're not going to get anything from this class.
4,Ellie is a wonderful woman that cares about her students' learning. If you ask her questions  she'll do her best to help. She tells a lot of stories about her feminist days and about her family. Don't expect an A if you never participate in class or take notes. The material is difficult  but becomes clearer and easier as the class goes on.
1.5,The best thing to do in this class is pick the little gems of knowledge out of the rest of the mental dustcloud that gets kicked up  and never settles. Extremely nice woman  a rockstar in France  but the material's difficult to grasp and the grading mostly random. Start Wikipediaing Lacan now if you want to understand  but your grade'll survive.
5,Outstanding.
1,This woman is so strange. She missed so many classes that it was ridiculous. We spent the entire semester studying Lacan  but I don't remember a bit of it. Somehow I pulled an A and a B+ on my papers  even though I had absolutely no idea what I was talking about.
2.5,Jacques Lacan. I know his name now. We studied this man the entire semester and I wrote 2 papers that I had absolutely no clue what they meant when I was finished. Very confusing. She tried  but it wasn't that helpful. She is an easy grader though. Just go to class and keep your notes.
1,Her class was on Lacan  but when she tried to help us understand  it just made me more confused.
5,An excellent professor who challenges students to think  to reconstruct knowledge and how their learning process.
1,Worst English teacher every. See frequently missed class  and that was rather relieving. Sitting through that class was dreadfully. In class she only talked about strange critical theory and it mentally healthier to just zone out her lectures.
5,Vinnie is the best professor I've had by far. His lectures were the most interesting I've ever sat in. You can tell he really cares about his job and it shows in his energy. The workload: no homework  3-4 really easy mc quizzes  and two straightforward essays. Easy A if you go to lecture and actually listen and take notes.
5,Still my favorite professor to date.
5,I'm the 100th! Hands down to the best professor I've ever had. Hope he's enjoying his retired life! I miss you Vinnie!
5,A little intimidating at first  but this is a man who you will not forget. Amazing lectures that will leave you thinking long after you left the classroom.
5,Welcoming and informative. Plays music before class sometimes. Class consisted of lectures and a weekly quiz. Lectures were enjoyable and engaging. Quizzes were easy if you read the blog posts and documents. Overall one of the best professors  especially at Mount Holyoke. Would 10/10 recommend taking his class even if not majoring in politics.
5,Take this class. Without a doubt the most inspirational professor I have ever had. He was one of the reasons I chose to come to this college. You won't be disapointed.
5,MY FAVORITE PROFESSOR ON EARTH!!!
3.5,His lectures were pretty pointless in my opinion...I only attended class on the days we had class. He sends you an e-mail of all the readings that will be on the quizzes. The only thing was  there was so many articles to read and he really wanted you to know the dates of things. but he's funny and approachable during class! Would recommend!!
4.5,An inspirational lecturer to say the least. We had to maintain an online blog  aside from his weekly quizzes.
5,WILL NOT DISAPPOINT. Amazing lectures  you won't be bored. Very helpful and funny prof as well  always there to talk or give advice. If you have the chance  take his courses. One of the best professors I've had the pleasure to know in my 4 years as an undergrad.
5,IT IS MIND-BLOWING HOW BRILLIANT THIS MAN IS. Knows so much about the world. Class is easy. Weekly quizzes (10 multiple choice) and a final project (either website or blog). The best professor at MHC and I don't even like politics!!! But this class was awesome!!
5,Vinnie is incredibly well-liked all over campus--and as soon as you take a class from him  you'll know why. He's smart  funny  and pushes you to consider other points of view in a way that doesn't invalidate your own. He respects your opinion  as long as you can back it up. Will take more classes from him in the future.
4,Professor Ferraro's lectures exciting and very informative.
5,Vinnie is the most amazing teacher. I would definitely take his class again and respect him as a teacher and as a person.
5,This class will not disappoint you. Vinnie is a brilliant  humble man and an amazing lecturer. He makes world politics interesting and dynamic in a liberal arts setting. Despite his MIT degree  he always emphasizes how MHC women are the best intellectuals of the generation to change the world. Very inspiring and awesome!
3,He is cool. He is also the type of Prof. that gives student a break bc he knows how hard we work and that sometimes MHC can get really really overwhelming.
5,International political economy is the name of the class. I LOVED every moment of it. The readings are manageable  the papers are interesting and his passion for political economy is contagious. EVERYONE should take this class
5,Best class I've ever taken
4.5,Ferraro is a great professor and you will learn a lot. Straight forward directions. Half of your grade is your quiz average and he drops the 2 lowest grades. Once you figure out what kind of questions he asks on the quizzes they are relatively easy. He is pretty lenient with the final project grades. Take this class!!!!
5,Vinnie teaches his students that the pursuit of knowledge is not a burden  but a worthy goal. Some find his classes stressful because the learning process is not as painful as they have grown to expect. His lectures are not for the cynics and jaded of heart. Keep your mind open and you will learn more than you thought possible with so much peace.
5,I took Gender and Social Change with Dr. Downer. It was an online class  she expects a lot  but it is great! The readings she selects are eye opening. I really enjoyed the class a lot and recommend you take her if you have the opportunity.
5,Wonderful teacher !!!!!! Extremely helpful!!!!
5,Very understanding and helpful. She lets you make up work and redo papers that you might not have done so well on. Computer coarse is simple to follow and as long as you do the work  you'll pass.
5,No Comments
4.5,She's pretty cool. I learned a lot and she's really nice and helpful.
5,She's like the happy helpful mom-ish teacher in a film. Does everything she can to help each student individually  both with class projects and related outside projects. Wants you to succeed!
5,The best professor in the whole college ! Cares for your project and grade like it's her own. More than a teacher she is a mentor.
5,Awesome Teacher. Learned a lot from her.
5,Get on her good side  she is full of connections
5,Tina Laplaca is very great at what she does. She juggles a lot being both a professor and an advisor. She gives great advice and wants you to succeed in life. Her lectures are fun and informational because she shares both her knowledge and personal experiences. She is highly recommended you wont be disappointed.
4.5,I love Professor Laplaca. She's like a mother to her students. Extremely pleasant and genuinely wants you to succeed. The problem is that she gives you an extremely long time to finish each project which isn't how the real world is. Also  I've seen people with bad projects still manage to get A's because she's a very easy grader.
4.5,Very nice woman. Projects are fun and easy to complete (IMO). Always there for students  but sometimes to the extent of being a pushover re: due dates and quality like most of Mercer's art courses  critiques are too lax and the quality of work is severely overrated. She is also the advisor for the Graphic Design Club.
5,Great Teacher-loves typography  makes the class fun and environment friendly.Would take any class from her again!
5,OMG Professor Laplaca is the BEST professor at Mercer. Honestly i wish i could take all my adv classes with her. She makes class interesting and involves all the students in activities  class discussions and critiques. I love the class and her as the Professor.
5,Tina is a great professor! Helped me so much in understanding graphic design in a whole new sense. She is also my advisor and has guided me well throughout the semesters. She's very understanding and is a fair grader as well. Loved her classes and her!
5,Best Class Ever! She made us learn the material and design.
5,Best Class Ever! She makes the class learn and enjoy the process. Very creative.
5,Will Take Her Class Again!
5,WONDERFUL TEACHER!
5,Great class! Enthusiastic professor  she made learning fun  and I have a great transfer portfolio. She helped me get into my transfer school too. Thank you.
5,Best Prof ever. Hands down.
4.5,Was in college 10 years ago. Tina helped shape my future and was one of the best professor's I had. Gave great advice for career and life and made class fun.Pretty hot too :)
4.5,Fantastically high energetic  has great stories and amazing experiences. Most importantly  you leave with a better portfolio and knowing a lot more about the graphic design world.
5,Fun and exciting class  she makes learning interesting!
5,Tina is a great professor. She helped me grow into the leader I have become today. We grew very close over the time that I attended her classes and I would recommend her to anyone. She is a great educator  mentor  and friend.
4,She is fair to all students. At the graduate level  she doesn't talk about attendance  but she still cares about it! She teaches molecular biology in a new way. Her stress is on experiment designing and techniques.
5,Took her for Senior Seminar and she was wonderful. I learned so much from her and she is always willing to help.
3.5,This is a hard class but she explains stuff thoroughly
4.5,funny lady  and shes hot. tests tend to be a bit lenghty however.
3,No Comments
4,Hays is definitely set in her ways but shes fair. Her rules are simple I dont know why its hard for people to follow them. Dont be on your phone  come to class prepared and dont disrupt class. She wants the answers on tests in a specific way but she gives you exactly what you need to study word for word so its not hard
1,This class is a complete waste of time
5,Hays is really sweet and nice. If you use your phone she will call you out. As long as you pay attention and do your work you wont have a problem with her. Her test reviews are really helpful when it comes to the test! So do them! Make sure you go to class in order to to edmodo (Big part of grade).
4,Professor Hays is a sweet lady  but gets caught up with silly things like people having phones out or drinking something other than water. She is a much better teacher than previous professors I have had for math concepts. Study for tests and memorize definitions as she is a tough grader and wants specific definitions.
4,She is definitely moody for sure. Her class isn't really that difficult. She's just very strict  like no food and phones on the table. No talking/ whispering when she's talking. Attendance is mandatory. Don't be late. The classwork and assignments is pretty easy.
3,Hays is a very serious professor. As long as you don't eat or drink something other than water  she will like you. You should NEVER use your phone in her class or she will call you out. She lets you make up lost points for assignments as long as you turn them in on time. Make sure you come to class because Edmodo is a large part of your grade!
2,She's mediocre at best. Her classes can be fun and are very easy. however  her tests have nothing to do with lectures and she is very picky when it comes to testing and projects. She can be pretty rude and doesn't allow food in the classroom aside of water. She is sweet at times but can be pretty mean that second later. Overall  I got a highly B.
1,Get ready to deal with an old moody lady with a bad temper. She can be super sweet and nice! Once you turn around  she is a completely different person. She disrespects students like if they were 5 year olds. Don't even think about skipping class!
1,She's is very rude. Focus too much on irreverent things. Doesn't even teach  she just reads off the handouts. She'll call you out if you're chewing gum or eating food  which is very childish. If there's another teacher teaching this class  TAKE IT. Horrible teacher.
3,Class seems easy. Attendance and Edmodo count a lot. Does not allow  food  gum  cell phones  nor drinks in the classroom  not even if its a 3hr long period. Other than that class is not that bad. her tests can be hard  but if you look over the chapter and notes  test should not be too hard. She would send out a review for the test  pretty helpful
4,Sassiest professor I've ever had. No drinks or food other than water. But  over all her class was pretty easy if you show up  do her daily reflections  and follow her syllabus to the dot. Lot of papers to keep up with. I ended up dividing mine by week in a binder.
2,She is one of the rudest professors I have ever taken. She will not let you eat or drink in class unless it's from a water bottle. No sodas or coffee. She goes over activities in class  but her tests are NOTHING like what she goes over. She will call you out if you're caught on your phone or you're talking while she is talking. Beware of her!!
3,Easy IF YOU PAY ATTENTION. She teaches based on application  not content. Expect things you don't know to be on the test. She grades easy but it is the tests that will get you. Make a study group - quizlet helps immensely with this class. Sweet lady but not the nicest of people  and will treat class as if it is an elementary school classroom.
1,Incredibly rude and disrespectful towards students and other adults. This is a university  not an elementary classroom.
4.5,Mrs. Hays is a very sweet lady. She seems to genuinely care about everyone  and wants you to do well. However  she does get annoyed if you are talking to someone while she is. No food or cell phone allowed in class- she will literally call you out. Just be respectful and pay attention. You will receive an easy A!
5,She was a delight! I loved this class so much and she offered so much help. Assignments are easy. Ff you do them right  you will get full credit. She is a tough grader when it comes to tests though  just be sure to study!
4,Professor Hays was delightful! Never did I have an issue with her or teaching method. Hays was strict but fair. Mandatory attendance  if you pay attention to the details you will for sure pass her exams. Beware though her exams do become a bit harder. Hays can be rude sometimes but many overlooked it. I would take her again  made an A+.
4.5,Very sweet lady but beware her exams are kinda hard. You can't put things into your own words it has to be exactly what she says or she will count it wrong.
5,Mrs. Hays is very sweet. Yes she is old-school where you're not allowed to have drinks in the class...BUT she wants you to PASS! She provides MUCH MUCH extra credit if you show you're trying. Love her. Good lady. Classes are easy. Tests are hard if you don't study.
4,Tests are hard and every single point counts. Only 34 point different in an A and a B. I was 4 points from an A and she would not pump me up ... and I was at every single class. Strict  but I would take her again. Just follow her review and study hard!
5,Professor Maguire is a smart and kind person. She goes above and beyond her everyday teaching responsibilities to make sure every student is successful during the semester. But she is not a pushover.
1,HER LECTURES WERE LONG AND BORING! TALKS WAYYYYYYY TOO MUCH! CLASS IS OPTIONAL  BUT BE THERE FOR LABS TO PASS! TEST WERE ONLINE  BUT WE PROBABLY RUINED THAT FOR FUTURE CLASSES. BE PREPARE TO SPEND 100$ ON THE BOOK FOR HOMEWORK! FINALLY BE PREPARE FOR LENGTHY HOMEWORK WHICH INCLUDES READINGS AND MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS.
3,Labs are easy but if you don't show up you get a 0. If you're there its hard to fail. Lots of the lab material along with a 30 minute video every week has to be done outside of class.
3.5,Probably one of the hardest classes I've taken so far. Had to fight to barely make an A. Only consists of quizzes and lab reports and both are 50% of final grade. Quizzes are super tough! Lab reports are easy if you go by the labmanual (required). Good professor but TA does most the work. Tough lab overall.. Get different professor if you can.
1.5,She is never there and does not help much. The quizzes are VERY hard and hurt your grade. I would not take her class unless you absolutely have to!
1,She is not a good teacher
2.5,She is very passionate about the topics but it's more like she is trying to convince you to be passionate about it rather than teaches you about the topic. She will ask you questions that no one knows the answers to because we haven't gone over it and then expects us to know the answer.
1,Do not take this class from her if you do not have too. She is not helpful. Her quizzes are very hard. She will tell you to study the lab reports for the quizzes but then there will be things on the quiz that weren't on the lab reports. Always follow her directions because she will take points off for everything.
2.5,Don't take her unless you can teach yourself outside of class. she's a terrible teacer plus her monotone in 8am.. sigh.. not the best teacher.
2,She did not have grades uploaded on blackboard until the semester was over. She told us 2 weeks before school let out that we could make up assignments but at the time i had all 100s then i look on after the semester ends and shes added lots of grades that are like 40s and 60s.I would have done some of that make up work if those grades we uploaded
4.5,Ms. Maguire was great. I took Intro and she explained the material well. She is obviously passionate about the subject and her enthusiasm made it interesting. It is possible to do well if you do all assignments PLUS practice problems.
1.5,She was an okay teacher. The only thing I had a problem with was that I received an 89.75 and she wouldn't even make it an A which I thought was a little ridiculous considering it is only 0.25 points and she would not round it up. Considering other teachers would raise your grade a whole point to give you an A she couldn't even round it up.
5,very clear and tells students all expectations. She offers office hours extra credit  extra worksheets  ungraded practice homework  and even sends links for websites and youtube videos. She's the most clear professor ever. If you didn't get a good grade in this course  it is because you did not study or learn the material. Period. She's great.
1.5,I had to teach myself a lot of the time. Her tests are really hard because she teaches straight off of the powerpoint. The online sapling homework helps a little with understanding material but I don't think I would recommend her. She doesn't care to help you pass if your failing.
4.5,She provides many opportunities for advancement in the class. If you show up to class and study  there should be no problem for you to make a good grade.
1.5,She's a stickler about everything. She's not the one teaching  but she does drop in regularly. WATCH YOUR VIDEOS ! She quizes on them  and also make sure you go pick up your previous quizes  she reuses material.
2,She seems like a really sweet lady but is one of the toughest teachers ever. I basically had to teach myself everything and her deadlines are super early. Attendance is mandatory and she is speaks in a monotone voice which makes the class more of a bore. I do not recommend her!
1,This class was very boring  and she was trying to go over everything without any clarification. She was so focused on getting it done rather than making sure we actually learned the material.
4,Great class  I really enjoyed attending. Took the summer course and Ms. Maguire is an amazing teacher  really enjoyed her lectures  as long as you focus  and study  she's awesome.
1,This woman is a terrible teacher. She teaches directly off of her powerpoints  but she doesn't even know the material. The first test is material from high school and is easy  but after that  I never made higher than a 55. The final is a state exam
3,Julia is a very smart professor who knows what she's talking about. However  she doesn't know how to explain concepts properly especially for harder accounting classes (AFA). She goes really quickly through the course materials which leads you to major confusion and she doesn't really show you how to write good cases  but expects you to be good
4,Awesome professor! Lots to learn  but make sure you attend class. Exams are pretty tough but definitely fair  would highly recommend.
4,Basically the boss in accounting department. might intimidate you at first  then you realized she just doesn't have time for non-sense and casual talking. her slides are informative but notes are strongly recommended because I found it a bit difficult to figure it out if I missed the class. GOOD LUCK!
4,Hands down one of the best professors I've ever had. Very clear and concise  extremely helpful  and passionate about what she teaches. Do not hesitate to take her
5,Wish I could take her for all accounting courses!
4.5,Excellent teacher... Common midterm for all sections and all her sections had the highest average. Her slides are super clear and so is her method of teacher. Would def take for Intro to Accounting
4,Although she clearly cares a tonne for her students  the teaching method can be a bit confusing. If you want to learn  shexe2x80x99ll help you. Learn the midterm material perfectly because you wonxe2x80x99t have time to finish the exam (3 hr exam in 2 hrs). I actually would recommend her as she is reasonable  caring and available for meeting
5,Really awesome and nice professor... she is so organized and prepared and she really cares about her students but watch out for the midterm!
5,Most consistent  organized  helpful and clear teacher I've had this semester. Would definitely recommend.
2.5,Prof. Scott is supposedly one of the most qualified accounting professors. However  her ability to explain things  such as pension plans  is limited  and her slides are not very clear and useful for exam review. Be sure to master fundamental accounting materials before taking her class.
4.5,Professor Scott really knows her stuff. Her exams and assignments are challenging but fair. One of the better accounting profs. There's a class quiz  two case studies  midterm and final. Make sure you know how to write a proper case as it makes up for half of your mark on the exams. Recommend her but you'll have to do work to keep up.
5,Great great professor. She seems cold at first  but she is a very to the point  no crap woman...she is very helpful when you ask questions and is grateful to those who come to class and participate. the class is not easy but shes great
3.5,Quite interesting thought process. Exam are often tricky.
5,Very knowledgeable! good pace!
1,She is awful  you will not understand anything from her lectures. You will only sleep.
5,best teacher ive had all my time @ mcgill. i have taken her for intro and intermediate 1  and now take her for intermediate 2. she know's her stuff VERY well  EXTREMELY helpful and knowledgeable in subject matter. HIGHLY recommended! do your stuff and practice exercises and there's no reason for you to do poorly! AMAZING TEACHER!!!
4.5,For Intermediate Fin 1... Shes solid  knows her stuff  goes at a good pace and exams are fair. She preps you well for the exams.
3,A bit boring  but the exams are very representative of what we see in class...
4.5,I had her for MGCR211 and MGCR351  and i'm taking her for MGCR352. Everything she says in class is clear and she gives real examples related from her work experience. It is true that the exams were hard but it was hard for everyone  even ppl who did not take her so it's just the way the profs make the exams and not Scott's way to teach.
2.5,So I heard amazing things about this prof before taking the class but she was actually not that great. I find that she was sometimes all over the place and not very organized. Also not very approachable. The exams were not representative of the material learned in class and they were brutal especially the final. Still managed to get a good grade...
5,Have had him for several classes. Study the power point and you will get an A but know it inside and out. He is a wonderful caring professor who will go out of his way to explain things. Sometimes he seems a little annoyed if you ask too many questions but he always is willing to answer them. You get out of class early.
1,Terrible instructor....
5,took dr. c for psychopathology and he was incredible! he definitely isn't easy  but you learn a LOT and he is extremely helpful and insightful . he's also been my advisor and he's been awesome in that regard as well . i'd highly recommend taking him if you're willing to work hard & want to learn!
5,Really knowledgeable  helpful  and approachable   but if you're the type who isn't a fan of tests and exams  you will have a hard time.
5,Dr Cavaiola is extremely knowledgeable and is a great communicator. He makes the class interesting and insightful. He also goes out of his way for students who need help. He is a seasoned and fun professor who is a fair and honest grader.
2,Dr Caviola seems nice until he gets stressed...then you will see his other side....students don't be fooled...
5,Dr. Cavaiola is an amazing professor. Had him for psychopathology  and he is the only professor you want for this class. He is very clear  class is entertaining and he has a wealth of information. If you need help  all you need to do is ask!
5,I had Dr. Cavaiola for 3 classes-psychopathology  marriage  and family. He is not easy  but the best professor to take if you want to learn a lot. His classes are fun and interesting  and he is very professional and fair. He is the epitome of what a professor should be.
3,i think he needs to encourage classroom interactions within peers and teacher-student as well since the subject is psychopathology for counseling.
2.5,Not good. Goes into rages when stressed. Be careful.
5,Prof Cavaiola was one of my favorites. I had him for crisis intervention and I was never bored. His stories were always interesting and the material wasn't bad. I wish I could take him for another class.
5,No Comments
5,He's sucha nice  calm  relaxed guy. Crisis intervention was awesome and Abnormal was even better. The projects in his class are pretty interesting and he is a very fair grader and always willing to help you out.
3,Pretty good teacher  his voice is so relaxing. He is not the easiest grader though. Class is cancelled and you get out early a lot.
4.5,great professor!
5,Intelligent and able to relay the materials. Not to mention he is one hell of a nice guy as well.
5,I had him for Crisis Intervention and Abnormal Psych. He is the nicest teacher I have ever had! I never heard him raise his voice once and he is also very interesting. He makes class fun to go to. You watch a lot of videos too.
5,great teacher  his class is interesting  watch many videos  lets class out early a lot  very sweet.
4.5,The best teacher at monmouth!
5,I had him for abnormal and for crisis intervention and he if i could i would have him for every class. he makes learning fun  class is never boring with him. and hes soooooo nice. great teacher. i recommend him to anyone.
4.5,The lab is setup by El Centro and he has no control over the tests (which were difficult). His lecture tests were straight from the powerpoint. He didnt test on anything that he didnt cover. He is very nice and wants you to make a good grade. I wish he was teaching SCIT 1408 in the fall. I would love to take another one of his classes.
5,Great teacher! Easy exams just study his powerpoints and you will pass with an A the lab quizzes are pretty tough but the biology department makes those you don't need a book and he will tell not to buy the $200 recommended book
5,Great teacher. I wish he was teaching 1408. Would highly recommend. Lab quizes are difficult but are made by the biology department. He never tests on information he didnt cover in lecture. Gives a good review before most tests.
4.5,Very Helpful and wants you to succeed in the course. Mr. Husbands has alot of knowledge and makes the class fun. I never missed a class! I HIGHLY recommend  you will not regret it.
5,HE IS A GREAT TEACHER A&P IS NOT AN EASY CLASS NO MATTER WHERE YOU TAKE IT BUT HE IS VERY HELPFUL AND WILL ANSWER ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS AND HE DOES NOT TEST YOU OVER THINGS THAT HE DID NOT COVER IN LEC. TEST ARE VERY EASY AND FAIR YOU JUST HAVE TO DO YOUR PART AND READ AND STUDY.....OVERALL GREAT TEACHER......
5,He was awesome really tried to help you understand and pass the class!!!
5,Great teacher. Very helpful. The people who did those other ratings are wrong!
1,Unfamiliar with class work. Cannot ID class handouts!
5,Awesome teacher. And if your lecture teacher for the class doesn't explain it very well  Chris is very good at explaining it in a way that you can not only understand it but will remember it for quizes and practicals.
5,Chris not only knows the material forward and backward  he single-handed sets up labs for the entire biology department. ask any question a/b any model or experiment and Chris can give you a definite answer...or research the answer for you!

4,Prof. Harding is an amazing professor. The content of the class was pretty tough and he did an amazing job teaching it to us. Be prepared to read and write  there were about 6 novels we had to read for this course. Show up and show him that you care and you will be fine.
3,This class was alright  but sometimes he was rude to students in class. The papers were a challenge  and the take home exams were no breeze. I would not take him again.
4,Great guy. Makes a boring subject fun  and is probably one of the nicest professors on campus
5,As an English major  I absolutely adored Dr. Harding. His classes were intellectually stimulating and I always felt challenged to understand literature in a more in-depth way. Dr. Harding offers students the opportunity to revise papers  gives students incredible feedback  and makes his class very interactive.
4,Prof Harding is funny and personable. He grades a little tough but gives you the rubric before hand so you know what you're going to be graded on. He doesn't put almost any grades in BB until the very end of the semester so it's hard to know how you're doing in the class. He is a fun professor and tries to make things interesting.
4.5,Harding is definitely one of the better English profs on campus. He is extremely intelligent and his English accent isn't bad to listen to either. He really appreciates when his students go to him for help and participate in class. Went to his office hours once for help on a presentation and he guided me through the whole thing. GO TO CLASS.
4,I really enjoyed Professor Harding's class. He's really funny and easy going. There are only 2 exams (midterm & final) from what I can remember and they're both take home. There is one presentation but it is with a partner and its super easy. He has one short paper 3-4 pages and one long paper 5-7 pages. This is an easy class to get a WI credit.
4,He is a great prof his assignments are not always the clearest but is really willing to work with you he makes class fun I would recommend taking him for your English 201 class.
2.5,For a class with Freshman non-English majors  the class was rough. He expects a lot from his students  and you have to work to improve your grade. There was little substantive feedback on the essays and in class
3.5,"I really enjoyed having this class with Des. He's a really smart guy and it's interesting to hear everything he has to say. He always seemed to care about us as students and our opinions. You could tell he wanted us to be successful. He's sort of a quirky guy  so not everybody liked him. ""There's no such thing as a perfect paper!"""
4,As inspirational as he is hilarious  and one of the few people to truly challenge my writing capacities. I went to him for advice on an assignment topic and he provided me with a mini lecture on the subject. His lectures might seem vague  but he prefers to generate thought rather than telling you what to think.
4,At times  Dr. Harding can be a little all over the place. He is really interested in his teaching though and he really wants to motivate and excite his students as well. He is a very nice guy and is always willing to talk and help his students. He does grade a bit touch and there are quite a few assignments. Overall though  not a bad class.
1,Absolutely awful experience in the class. I always felt as if I was drowning and he did little to help when I asked questions. He has a way of giving you an answer without actually answering anything and leaving you more confused than when you asked the question in the first place.
4,"Des knows his stuff and he expects you to work hard. He once told me he thinks of himself like a captain of a ship whose sole mission is to get from Point ""A"" to Point ""B"" (the beginning of the semester to the end of the semester) and if he loses some crew members along the way  so be it. Hilarious  chill guy if you get to know him a little."
4.5,Dr. Harding was always willing to help me and pushed me to do my best. I appreciate him so much. He was nothing but kind and generous with his time. I loved the novels we read too.
1.5,How does this man have such a high rating?? Always unclear about what he wanted  totally abstract in his lectures  held us to grad school standards  grading standards made absolutely no sense  and showed very inappropriate video clips and mocked anyone who was uncomfortable with it. Did everything a GOOD teacher would NEVER do. Would NOT recommend.
5,Dr. Harding is one of the best professors I've ever had. He's intelligent  funny  and he cares about his students.
1.5,Worst professor I've ever had. Ridiculous amount of expected reading  unclear directions for every assignment and very harsh grading. He's a nice guy  but he does meet you at your level. He acts as if everyone has read the texts as much as he has. He just read off a piece of paper and didn't care if you were learning or not. I learned nothing.
5,He is a very creative professor  loved his lectures. There is a lot of reading  but all the novels are completely worth reading! Highly suggest him!
2,At first  the class seems great: humorous  discussion-based. But entertainment can only disguise the lack of content for so long. His arrogance and sarcasm cross the line from enjoyable to inappropriate. Instructions are oftentimes long and confusing. If you want to actually learn  don't take Harding. Overall  an extremely frustrating experience.
4.5,awesome class because of instructor. would have taken advanced courses had they offered them as night courses instructed by Ed. I put off taking this class -sorry I did. should have taken it sooner.
5,Ed. Ed Ed Ed. I loved this class  and not only because he was sexy. He actually was passionate about the subject matter  and he helped clarify already instilled opinions I had. I can easily say this is one of the best teachers at AICOC outside of core or lab classes. I would probably take the class again if I had the money :X
5,He definelty inspired me
5,Best teacher at AICAOC in my opinion. He is very big on concept and will help you become a better designer. You should take at least one of his classes before you graduate.
5,No Comments
5,AMAZING teacher. always willing to go beyond requirements and is so inspiring.
5,This class requires the teacher to help create your preception of art  form and design. Ed does this wonderfully and you'll find yourself wanting to have a conversation with him.
4,A crazy teacher with a weird way of expressing himself  but a great guy and im glad to have had him.
5,Energetic  passionate instructor. He is great to have discussions with  especially if you disagree with his viewpoint. He loves the discussions which is why we always ran behind. Didnt give grades on homework - just credit/no credit which was a nice change.
3,He's one of the good teachers. Definite must take as a teacher for any one of his classes.
4,No Comments
5,Ed is very helpful and is always trying to better his classes. Although this class reiterates principles of design  it puts them in a very subjective light. Dont be afraid to have very strong opinions  but also dont be afraid to listen to other people's arguements. This is a very interactive class
4.5,Ed is wise beyond his years in the art field. Great guy and a great teacher.
4,"""I am mad as hell and not going to take it anymore!"""
4,ed's one cool hot guy.
5,Ed is great. I felt that this class was a little basic for him  and would like to have a more advanced class with him. He is extremely knowledgable  and has the crudentials.
5,I disagree  he is clear. He knows the material  sometimes he presents too much info  more than most teachers.
3,He's a nice guy  but unclear a lot of the time. Wish you could get the same out of other teachers though  has very good ideas.
4,very nice teacher
5,HOT
5,Jim is one if the greatest professors I have ever met! a true mensch. he cares deeply about theatre so much so that even if you have a limited knowledge of theatre he engages you to constantly do more to grow! your knowledge is fed by the true genius of the mans knowledge. he invites the best of the best to come in to do workshops! take his classes
2.5,Great guy  horrible professor. He would be a great professor for students not taking an intro course. He is very unclear in his expectations and has major mood swings. Kicked whole class out twice for things we have no control over. Probably the reason the theatre department is not strong at UA. Would take as a sr but maybe not as a fresh or soph
4.5,The way Jim teaches theatre is outside the mainstream and focuses the actor as an organic  empty vessel. The work is challenging and puts the actor's attention on the others and on the space rather than on the ego. This way of working is for actors who want to let go of the blocks that are holding them back from being in the present.
2.5,"As a professor  although he was really out there  I appreciatd Jim for opening my eyes to a different style of theatre. However  as a graduate advisor he has failed us miserably. He doesn't respond to emails or look over drfts  simply complaining he's ""too busy."""
4,One of the best Acting classes I've taken. Jim really makes you think outside the box and will always take the time to help you out in a pinch. The class has no real homework except for two partner scenes and one monologue. Overall a great class.
1,Taking Theater at the college level is like going to kindergarten with a PhD This professor makes no attempt to change this stigma. He is more concerned with showing how good he thinks he is than teaching the basics of good performance. This class does not prepare students for the vocal talent it takes to perform on stage.
5,"His classes were challenging and interesting. If you show up and do the work  you can earn a fair grade. I felt inspired by his passion and dedication to the theatre. When he is pleased  or when he finds something ""interesting "" his face lights up."

5,Jim Slowiak is one of the best teachers i've had at the University of Akron. I learned more about acting technique in one semester from him  than any other professor in my six years at Akron. His views are different  but worth experiencing.
4,Jim is very demanding and expects you to give 110% at all times. He is also extremely helpful  and makes time to help you if you ask for it. Also  if you get a good grade in his class  you have EARNED it. His ideas are a bit out there for the mainstream  but keep an open mind and you'll make it!

1.5,Concepts don't apply to real world
5,I wish she was still at el Centro. I miss her and they need her here. She is the best baking/pastry instructor they had here.
3.5,Chef Mattie is mean  likes to make fun of students. Also has favorites and if you not one of them can make your life miserable
4.5,She knows her material and she wants her students to succeed.
4.5,One of the best teachers I have had at El Cnetro
2,In my opinion chef mattie not in favor of blacks. Im white and she's said a lot of things in front of me about minority students.
5,Wow I cant believe people don't like her. She is an awesome teacher and don't buy what people say. You will learn a lot from her shes very clear of what she teaches. Shes very understanding and very straight forward. I had fun in her class and she Is one of my favorite teachers out there.
5,Best Teacher Ever! My Fav. she's always watching out for me  and always there for me. She's always in my heart and on my mind
1,"The bigest problem with her is that she picks her favorites. And if you are not one of her favorites  you are the s****of the earth and she makes it very clear to everyone what your social status is. Along with grades  she will give you tests but you will never know what your grade is because she ""forgets"" to grade them."
1,The worst teacher I have ever had. Always leaves the class and has too many favorites. Does not teach what we need to learn in a bakery class. You are only as good as what the teacher teaches.
5,she is an amazing teacher

2,I can't believe she's the head of the baking department! She is so far behind everyone else! No imagination! No energy! Does not challenge her students. Shows favorites. Take another instructor.
2,She is not a Chef. She does not have enough professional experience to teach. Her degree is in Aco****ing.She gossips about her students. I would never take another class from her again. I feel sorry for her students  they will be handicapped.
5,She is a great teacher. Patient with students. Knowledgeable and friendly.
2.5,If you're liked  you will receive help. If not  drop and find a new class. She was very nice to me (her best quality)  but she cannot bake. Unfamiliar with products for a former bakery owner. The same products are repeated throughout the semester. Rehash.
1.5,Be prepared to fight for mediocrity unless you are on her good side. I took this class after I took editing  so I knew a fair amount about AP Style and News  but she refuses to give good grades. If you are a comms major who likes to kiss up  you might do well. English majors beware. Would not recommend at all. No help  extra effort does not matter.
2.5,It's true she does expect you to be a newswriter at the start of class. She doesn't really teach you anything and then when you ask for help she tells you to look it up! Be prepared to write in your book and bring it everyday to class! She is nice though.
5,I really enjoyed this professor. She was very open and honest in discussions. I can tell she enjoys sharing her extensive knowledge. If I would've had her class sooner I would've considering changing my major. She grades fair and challenges students to do their best. She really had a positive impact on my life by what I learned.
5,Tough grader but very fair. She knows her stuff for sure and will help you out if you seek it.
1,"What a horrible prof. She expects everyone to be news writers and does take in consideration other majors. She is extremely condescending and passive-aggresive. She expects you to know all news writing terms even if they have not been discussed before. We spent the first six weeks discussing ""story ideas"" and did not do much else. BAD BAD BAD BAD."
1,She is extremely condescending and that impairs her teaching ability. Incredibly difficult to please  especially if you're not on her good side. Her lectures aren't helpful and are extremely repetitive. She doesn't ever help you with your actual writing.
5,Dr. Lueck expects well-written papers. I took this in the summer and I was the only graduate student. Lots of reading and writing but passable. She had a lot of feedback on my paper but i got an A. She is enthusiastic about her subject and lectures a lot. If you read the text and participate you'll be fine.
4,She may be a little unclear but if you as for help  she will help you. She does lecture a lot and can get a little redundant but I like her. Just work hard and she will notice.
2.5,I had this teacher for news writing. She grades way too hard for students who are just learning news writing. I was extremely interested in news writing and been on my high school newspaper staff and the editor of it  still got 70% on papers I turned in. Says she doesn't lecture much  opposite is true.
1,I had her for newswriting and she is very unclear and tests are over too much information to even study for. Most assignments seem unplanned and on the spot most days. There are no power points provided and you're basically on your own. I do not recommend this teacher if you're truly interested in news writing and enhancing your skills.
1,Horrible  horrible  horrible. Once this teacher has it out for you  do not ever plan on passing her class!
1,WOW! she is the most unclear professor I've ever had. She expects everyone to grow up and be a professional journalist for the new york times. She grades very hard and unfair  never expect a 10/10 on homework. Don't bother asking for her help she won't give it to you  she is overall insane and should not be teaching. DONT TAKE A CLASS WITH HER
3,Overall  she is a decent teacher but there are some problems. She is unclear about what she expects from assignments. Her grading system is harsh as she grades people as though they are professionals. Also  she tends to babble quite a bit and talks endlessly. However she is very nice and approachable and is willing to help when needed.
3,The teacher was overall nice  but she expects everyone in the class to be going into a journalist field and as such grades quite harshly. If you have a strong opinion of your own writing  chances are it will be gone by the time you're done with this class. Take another English writing class to offset this if this happens.
3,She teaches in a high school style. She tends to be unclear  yet unrelenting while grading.
1,This should have been a fun and interesting class  but Therese Lueck more or less had me think I couldn't write anymore. Fortunately I've regained my confidence and continue writing. Do not take this class.
2,Did not learn anything by taking her class. She'll tell you that you're writing is improving  and then give you a C+ on five straight assignments. Definitely would not reccomend her to anyone.
1,Condescending ****!
3.5,If she doesn't like how your writing style  your grade will reflect that. Assumes all students are future journalists  does not have much knowledge on how to effectively teach a class  but knows a lot of real world journalism. very nice though.
1.5,No Comments
5,Tied for best professor after 90 credits of classes. She will never have you read anything that isn't extremely useful. Doesn't ask for much  but always challenges you. Can be abrasiveprepare for tough lovebut you will grow. Very experienced. Don't pass her classes up if you want to learn to write better. This is my 3rd class with her.
5,Wonderful professor. Generous with her time. Cares about students. Gives honest  helpful feedback. Knows her stuff. One of my favorite classes at OU.
5,I had prof. Gilson for a writer's workshop-style class. Being a published author herself she understands how to balance supporting the writer's work while still pushing them outside of their comfort zone to help find their inner voice. If you are serious about your writing & want honest feedback in a creative setting prof. Gilson's class is ideal.
5,She is a wonderful professor. She's fun and slapstick  but is not someone to take advantage of. She knows her stuff  and she wants to help all her students learn and succeed with their writing goals.
5,Where to start? Annie is the BEST. I honestly owe so much of my academic and personal growth to her. She takes time both in class and out of class to make sure her students are okay and understand everything. Supportive  fun  AMAZING. Love her. Mentor  teacher  supporter. Speaks her mind and supports you for doing the same. Favorite prof ever.
4,She's weird  but in a good way. You'll read a lot in her capstone  but it's a very inviting and pleasant atmosphere. She's a professor that really truly engages with what she reads and works hard to make sure everyone is just as excited about the novels. Some work - but it's one of the most memorable classes I've taken here.
5,Gilson is hands down one of the best professors I have taken at OU so far and this class wasn't even for my major/minor. She is so inspirational  hilarious  and down right fantastic. Expect to write (duh) but have tons of fun while doing it! She legitimately made me think I chose the wrong major for myself just because of how interested I became.
4.5,She is really passionate about what she does. She treats students like her peers  and is really open about everything. GO TO THE LECTURES. Even though they're not mandatory  if you go and pay attention  the written exams will feel like a breeze. She makes you read some stories  but you also watch movies too.
2,I took Prof. Gilson because I read her Rate My Professor reviews and they seemed good. I hard a very hard time in her class  that I ended up dropping her class 8 weeks into the semester. I missed 1 class and she would not give me any notes or tell me what we discussed. She only grades based on exams and participation.
5,She's been an incredible mentor for not only me  but many others. She keeps her students in mind and updates on possible internshipsjobeducational opportunities. She has your back if you put the effort in--grades on development. LISTEN to her advice  and always ask questions. Don't be afraid to speak up. Hands-down  the best professor at OU.
5,Around 7 stories/novels and 3 movies (one of which you read and watch).You are to read up to a certain point in the story and then it is discussed in class. She gives you a set of 6 essay questions on each reading of which 2 will appear on the exam and you pick one to write on along with passage ids from the stories (parts you identify and explain)
5,The course starts of hard and gets easier as the semester goes on by design. You finish up by watching and analyzing movies. Attendance is not mandatory but she keeps track of it for participation. Read read read and come to class to succeed  bs will not work on exams as she can see right through it. Bring texts to class in order to follow along!
5,Loved this class. Kind of started off with difficult reading material  but gets way easier as the semester goes on (she does this on purpose). Very engaging and funny. Makes class interesting. Attendence not mandatory but she passes a sheet for participation. Very easy and fun class! Easy to pass  but if you dont read the material  she will know!
5,Best professor ever! Funny  fun  great discusssions  explians material well  and very helpful. This class is challenging  but no one learns anything from easy classes. Not that much reading. Analyze movies at end of semester. I looked forward to class. Knows all her students. Her enthusiasm made me more excited to be a English minor.
4,Annie is a great professor. Very educated  helpful  and willing to read your papers and cope together to improve your style of writing. There is too much reading in this class more than 10 books in a limited time. If you are an advocate in the world of contemporary English novels  you will be fine.Read and share your ideas  you'll be okay.
5,Prof. Gilson is one of those rare professors who takes pride in what she does. She is by far the most enthusiastic prof I've ever had and you'll agree the first time you have class with her. Her lectures are very interesting and keep your attention. The exams can be difficult  but only if you don't do the reading and don't attend class. Great prof.
5,Best professor I have ever had  period. I loved coming to this class and always found myself drawn into the discussion. Gilson is incredibly intelligent and has a lot to share if you let her. Her personality is very bold  but I found that to be a good thing. You can rewrite anything and she is flexible  so you have every opportunity to do well.
5,Very nice and extremely funny show for class and ask questions will give you a easy A on participation  and take notes very helpful on exams don't buy all the book needed some of the stories are online so you can just print them and exams a pretty easy if you pay attention in class  which you will cause she is so much fun!!!
4.5,She is brutally honest when it comes to critiquing work so at first I was afraid she would be a hard grader. I found her critiques to be helpful and her grading fair and even a little generous. She is opinionated  but tolerant of others' opinions. If you prefer the standard lecture class  she's not the professor for you.
5,She is one of my favorite professors ever. She's hilarious  honest  fun and intelligent. She loves to teach and wants her students to succeed. If you do the reading and answer the exam questions beforehand  you'll do great. I highly recommend taking her before you graduate from OU. Oh  and her class gets easier as the semester progresses. awesome.
5,LOVED HIM! hes a great guy and is very supportive and is more than willing to help if you need it. he really knows his stuff and hes very intelligent. overall an AWESOME teacher!
5,Very nice guy  tries to help you & knows almost everyones name. Presents material well  is always prepared  tests are fair & offers extra credit. Really easy to get an A if you go to class & take notes because there is no textbook.
4,a pretty easy grade...the lecture can get boring but its important to go to every class and take notes bc there is no textbook...study your notes before the test and you'll be fine...do the extra credit too..its easy and boosts your grade
4.5,he was a really great teacher! the lectures got a little boring sometimes but you could understand what he was talking about. the test ridiculously easy  take notes and know what he's talking about guaranteed at least a b  the readings also a bit dry in the beginning but not a necessity to pass the class overall a good teacher and class
5,this guy is great  the lectures tend to e dry  but  hes very helpfula nd hell do anything he an to help u pass. tests are difficult  but reports are simple. worth taking  just try and stay awake
5,He was a really nice younger guy who knows what he is talking about. i really enjoyed the class. he is really helpful and very clear...hes also really cute! =)
5,Best instructor I had at Newpaltz. Very supportive  clear  and helpful.
2.5,Dr. Rose is a nice person who loves what she does  but she is not good at teaching a large class. She goes through slides too quickly  not caring if people are still writing. The stories she chooses are strange and the assignments are unclear. I wouldn't take another class taught by her.
5,Top-notch professor  brilliant and engaging. A privilege to study under her.
3.5,She is very passionate however hard to pay attention to. She does not like differing opinions but she will not give you a bad mark based on disagreement. You can expect to do a lot of work in her class. 2 essays  A LOT of readings for each class and a closing assignment. She might be better in the morning than she is in the evening. Overall nice.
5,One of the finest profs Brock has - not an easy prof but passionate  committed and dedicated. You will learn so much from this woman. I would take another course from her in a heartbeat.
3,meh...she's okay.
4,Simply  the best you're gonna get
2.5,Just ask her about canoes
2.5,brutal prof ...lectures were SOOO boring ..the course itself wasn't that bad but she made it super boring! Vanessa the seminar leader ROCKED thou!!
4,Why wouldn't she be intelligent??? I agree though  yes  she's a good prof. too.
5,she's so intelligent  and also a really nice person. great prof.
3,Yup  was a real bore this one.
3,Kinda boring.
1,No Comments
5,This is a person who loves to teach almost as much as she loves to learn. Excellence.
5,great prof!
4.5,An amazing professor. Very soft-spoken  genteel woman... well-read  open  able to talk intelligently and knowledgably about everything. On top of all of that  she's a wonderful person  too!
3,The class does not prepare students to be a Children's Librarian  instead it is full of continuous book and multimedia evaluations. Student's will learn more working with a Children's Librarian than taking this class. This class is not taught but rather constructed from a text book.
5,Online class: Professor extremely helpful  provided guidance and clarity of assignments when sought by student.
1,"Too nit picky & she does try & humiliate you over email & to the whole class. She wrote on the announcements page ""I was pleased with all your assignments except for one student"" (which was me) that was really unnecessary. Gets mad when I use commas ""comma splice"" but then when I don't use commas its a run-on sentence. Like really which one is it."
1,Dr. Bishop personifies the failings of the UB program. She does not teach  instead relies on rudimentary handouts with questionable value. Her grade scale defies explanation.
2,a lot of work for an online class
1,another bad prof. wish she'd pick a better text than her own mediocre publication. wish she'd get replaced.
1,Crap teacher. Couldn't give her textbook away on Amazon! Too bad we couldn't have used a better text.
1,Awful. Not helpful and quite condescending. Might want to examine where her paychecks come from - her students.
1,VERY unprofessional - will publicly humiliate you over email to other professors. Not a decent woman in general.
3,Oh where to start with this lady? She seems very helpful and wants to know if you have any questions but when you ask a question  she acts like you are stupid for asking. Also  she rambles on for ever on stupid stuff. She also isn't the easiest grader
3,Nice man  makes accommodations  tough marker
4,Great lecturer. Tough grader.
4,Dr. Allard is very funny and very engaging! Even as a hard marker  he cares about his students and is very helpful. Everything you would want in a professor is in Dr. Allard. He is not only good at teaching  but also good at communicating what he wants from students. His marking is difficult  but very challenging and helps students learn and grow.
4,I thought that Professor Allard was awesome! He is an excellent speaker which made lectures interesting and engaging. This was my first english class in university and he made sure that the students understood clearly what was expected of them and was very approachable if you had any questions. I am always looking for more of his classes to take!
1.5,The first few lectures I was wowed with his lecturing ability. But this wore off as I realized he said the same thing over and over and over again. I also do not think that his course was well described in the description on line. The readings were horrible and most hard to understand. All he talks about: STORYTELLING. Every lecture. The whole time
4.5,Held amazing lectures  and let you know exactly what you need to do to pass the course  though he is a tough marker. The lecture material definitely had the potential to be boring  but Allard made everything interesting and fun!
3.5,Some of the most entertaining lectures I have ever attended. The lectures are largely optional  most of your grades come from your essays and seminar participation  which is graded by your TA. 0% on essay if its late policy. Having a good TA in this course in crucial. If your TA is giving you low grades  switch seminars or drop the course.
5,Dr. Allard's lectures were very engaging and he truly wants all of his students to be successful. I hope to be able to take more of Dr. Allard's classes in the future.
2.5,Professor Allard was a fairly solid professor. You could certainly tell that he was interested in what he was teaching. Sometimes it was hard for me to get anything out of the lectures however  because I felt some stuff he was talking about wasn't relevant and I had a hard time knowing what to write. I felt that he was also a hard marker.
4.5,Loved this class! No previous knowledge of the course and thought it was going to be very challenging  but his lectures are easy to understand and he makes the subject interesting. Good feedback on assignments and if you put the work in you will get a good mark.
4.5,Professor allard is tough but fair. He is very clear and concise in his lecture presentation and will give you all the tools and support needed to succeed  while promoting academic independence.
4,Honestly  such a great professer! His lectures were always funny and most of the time he would point out interesting ways to look at the novels or content we were reading. Always willing to help and always dropped hints for essays and exams for those who went to lecture. Easy exams if you went to class and listened
5,Best Professor. He keeps you intrigued with his lectures. As long as you go to the lectures and seminars and put in an effort  this class will not be a problem to get a good mark. His exams are no surprise because he is crystal clear with what he wants you to know.
5,Amazing Professor. It was an honour to be taught by Dr. Allard. It is clear that he is passionate about what he teaches. He is very clear in the way that he teaches and there is no room for misunderstanding. I've visited him during his office hour and even outside of lecture he is very helpful. Excellent Professor.
2.5,Nothing like what I heard the course was like  just turned into sonnets and reviews. Essays are marked extremely hard and you aren't encouraged to think for yourself
3.5,loved him  but found that the class was more like a lit theory class as opposed to romantic lit. some readings are VERY dry  you really have to force yourself to get into them  although he does a very good job of making the readings clear and interesting. my lowest mark in university  i only just passed and worked very hard but still loved allard
3.5,Amazing lecturer
4.5,I love Allard! I've had him every semester since second year and I have learned a lot from him. I think he's super helpful when it comes to office hours  but easy to make yourself look silly in front of him. Great prof  great lectures!
5,"I've been part of the ""Allard fanclub"" since first year. Utterly fantastic. He walks in lecture and holds the place spellbound for the next 45 minutes. He has deep knowledge and passion for his subject matter  and he's absolutely hilarious. You haven't truly been in an English class until you've had Allard!"
1.5,very disappointing  He tries to fit too many books into the course  and fails to discuss them in enough detail. Dont count on him taking any sort of personal interest in his students.
5,Great Prfessor  very helpful in the transition to university!
5,I heart Mills! She's the best Prof at Brock University. She's absolutely BRILLIANT.
5,Brilliant. what can I say. brilliant and an inspiration.
5,Dr. Mills is an amazing professor. She is very approachable and is willing to help any student who approaches her whether they have a question about an assignment or a personal problem
2,not a fan
5,Great Prof! Very approachable & Interesting! :)
5,i love her. best prof in the university. so much fun. so approachable. sooooo great! never had a prof that compares. i want to take every course that she teaches. love her love her love her ...
5,AMAZING prof. Definitely my favorite prof at Brock. I love her so much. I learn so much from her  and she is so helpful and actually cares about her students.
5,Angela is awesome  she makes english to intresting and explains everything is such a manner that everything makes sense!
5,Wow this Prof is smart. She knows so much about EVERYTHING which makes her lectures easy to understand. She is extremely fair and very approachable.
5,Awesome prof! She makes American Lit so much fun!
5,Not a fan of American Literature  however  now a fan of Professor Mills. Excellent teacher.
5,No Comments
1,Hes very rude and talks nonsense to the whole class. He gives out answers but changes the subject too much. I feel like I am not getting the proper learning I should be getting. Hes worse by far. I dont understand how hes an easy class of does not teach but talk useless information. I am trying to get a career here.
3,He gives 10 bonus points every test plus extra credit constantly. You don't have to show up but if you do youll get the extra credit. Constantly tells nutty stories.
5,He is very easy going. The class is not boring. He helps you to get a good mark.
5,Amazing professor. First day of class he said he has 2 PHD's and it definitely shows. He doesn't lecture word for word from the book but uses his real life experiences to teach us. He is hilarious and kind. Super easy course and a joy to be taught by him! If you have a chance  take him.
1,Lectures about himself. unbelievable stories. Guy is stuck in the 1960's. Literally didn't show up for our final. Easy A if you show up  but if your paying out of pocket not from financial aid or mommy and daddy. I was hoping to learn more. Very outdated teaching style. If your taking for credits  go for it. If you want to learn. forget about it
4,This guy is very interesting. His lectures aren't really helpful when it comes to the tests. With that said he gives a lot of extra points during class so showing up is a good idea. If you read the book it's an easy A. He does have a tendency to drone on about himself but the stories are pretty funny (and almost unbelievable).
5,Interesting! I wasn't sure I would pass at first because his style of teaching is a lot different. But as long as you read the chapters and go to class you will pass. His lectures are awesome. You will learn a lot about life. Brilliant man!
5,He great! Definitely recommend! Test are easy!
5,Dr Frank Mitchell is hands down the best instructor I've ever had the pleasure of learning from. He is kind and intelligent  and he cares about his students and is more than willing to make himself available and approachable. He explains the material in a way that is understandable. I plan on taking more of his classes in the future. LOVE HIM
3,"Professor Mitchell's class was my 1st college course taken in 18 years. His technique annoyed me at first  but once I got the hang of his style  he wasn't so bad. Read the book  follow the syllabus  and come to class and you will be fine. His stories are ""quite literally"" legendary!8-)"
1,"This professor rambles for 2.5 hours about stuff marginally related to the chapter at best. Self-centered and conceited  he believes no one is smarter than he. Doesn't really teach. Tells you first day to get an ""A""  read the book  but also to not trust the book. Would not recommend overall."
5,This professor will teach you more than any other professor at CCC. He lectures for the entire class  but they're always interesting. If you have an open mind and enjoy critical thinking  this is the guy for you. He will willing to help and clarify anything if needed.
5,Frank Mitchell is to-the-point. First day of class he tells you to get an A on the test you just read the chapter. You can literally ignore everything he says and read the book and get an A. He in an extremely entertaining lecturer even if he gets off track. There hasn't been a test without extra credit. He's extremely approachable and kind.
5,"He is ""quite literally"" the best professor at CCC. You will learn so much from him because he isn't afraid to tell the truth. Lectures are long  but he is absolutely hilarious. Great class"
3.5,Cool  interesting Professor!
3.5,Kind of a weird class. I had him for psychology 101 and the lectures were super long at first and not much for the test was covered in class  but towards the end you realize you don't have to show up to class except on test days and his stories and life lessons are actually really good and funny. He's a good guy. Easy A!
5,Great guy Very interesting and his lectures will definitely make you reexamine everything you thought you already knew. Expects you to know your stuff and read the assigned chapters but he has great stories that go along with his lectures.
4.5,Took Psychology of Death and Dying with him  and while it seemed to be his specialty  he teaches all psychology classes and based on my experience I'd recommend him for any class. Very little homework  very little reading  but I've honestly learned more from him than all other CCC professors combined. What a cool dude.
5,He is the best professor I had so far! His lectures are very interesting and just read the book and you'll pass his class!!!! Very funny guy and he is very passionate and knows his stuff!!!
4.5,Great teacher! Easy A if you just read your chapters. Must show up  but you can leave or take breaks whenever. TONS of extra credit!
4.5,challenging  but highly recommended. makes you think  somewhat out of place at a school like this.
2,Very quiet  very unclear  very nerdy. He means well  this is his first year. I cant say he is doing a bad job. If you need clarity  ask him and he will explain it.
5,I enjoy Chef Anne  she is my favorite teacher her at el Centro  and I can tell she loves her students as well as baking  She is an amazing woman  and is willing to experiment new receipts with her students.
5,Excellent instructor  take the class !!!
4.5,No Comments
5,Another fine instructor who also somehow seems to keep the kitchen running. Great knowledge of the industry and the people who run it. And a nice person as well.
5,Wide knowledge and cooking and baking. Easy going with students  as long as they pay attention and don't screw up. Recommended.
5,KWAG is amazing  one of the best classes. Go to class and pay attention and you will definitely easily get an A. Tells literally everything that's going to be on the midterm and finals
5,Kwag is a very knowledgable professor. His lectures are always interesting and if you are willing to work and participate in the class you can learn a lot and do very well. He genuinely wants students to succeed  although he may be strict at times. He is always available for help.
2.5,Do not Mess with him! Go to class  always. do the homework or your grade will be penalized! Make sure to read the chapters because the true or false section in his exam is worth it 20 points avg and he takes the questions from the book. If you take him for accounting you will do better overall in finance.
3.5,You have to understand three things: 1. Do NOT skip ANY of his classes  he knows. 2. Do ALL the assigned work. 3. When you think he hates you  he doesn't - he just wants you to do well. His class is like a non-stopping train from the first minute until the last. You HAVE to be focused. Show him you CARE about your future and you will do fine.
2.5,Awful professor. He is a very smart man in his field  tells you everything that will be on the exam  but even so the exams are incredibly difficult. Unfortunately  I recommend taking 310 with him so that you can get ready for his style in 410. The t/f questions kill  as do the long problems. Accounting is awful  with him more so.
3,Gives everything that will be on the exam in review  but it is still really difficult. He is a generous grader but not generous enough. There is no curve.
4,I took him for both my 310 and 410. He's good  the best professor in SHA. Just go to every class and take notes. He told you what the problem will be on the exam before hand. The T/F might be a bit tricky tho. I managed to got a perfect score on my last exam for 310. he only taught the basic stuff in the textbook. Recommend!
4.5,BEST professor in the world. I have been incredibly fortunate to have learned accounting from him. He is so intelligent. Go to him if you have questions about the material. Show that you care to work hard and succeed... do those things and you will gain his respect.. which is critical.
4.5,I had Kwag years ago and still remember his classes. You HAVE to go to every class and do the work. He is an outstanding professor and notices who shows up and who does not. He's extremely smart and you will learn a lot from him. He's more than willing to help  but if you don't keep up with the work it will run you over.
4.5,Kwag's class is pretty difficult but he is such a helpful and kind professor. He is always willing to help students who actively seek help. He sets up after-class tutoring every single day so there is always help available. Exams are pretty tough and take a firm understanding of the material. Not too bad though  I got a 97 on the first one.
4,He is amazing! Inspirational speeches everyday. Just do the HW's well  actually read and UNDERSTAND the book  and study and work hard for exams.
2.5,Great guy. Very open to helping you as long as you try. Go to tutoring  go to class  although he doesn't take attendance - HE NOTICES AND TAKES IT INTO ACCOUNT. Do the homework  show that you are trying and you will have no problem getting whatever grade you think you deserve.
1.5,I know he seems intimidating. It's easy. The key to this class is to do the work. People don't come to class prepare (ie do the readings) and then expect him to teach all the basics. It's simple. Do the work before class  challenge yourself by extra problems  ask the tutor if you have questions and you'll do fine.
2.5,my stomach used to turn every day when i went into his class. good luck
1,kwag  kwag  kwag...wow. In my 22 year career as a student I have had perhaps one other teacher this bad  this boring  this hard to follow. It is simple. he should not be teaching period.
5,really good teacher
4.5,His classes are tough  I agree with other students' opinions. BUT! he is very helpful for students to understand through individual tutoring during the class. All students in my class had worries about him before taking classed  but they has been changed after taking classes. Also  his personality and efforts are great!
1,worst teacher ever
1.5,watch out.. not helpful  rude  and teaches at lightning speed. dont even bother going to him for clarification on anything. arbitrarily grades tests. will take 5 points off for one small error on one persons paper  and 5 points off someone elses when they got the entire thing wrong. Unfair  hard to understand  and just overall terrible!!!
1,Kwag was a nightmare! You could not understand him and he is not interested in helping the students. The worst that SHA has to offer. It is a shame the dean uses him as a showcase professor.
5,Next to Dr. McMonigle  probably the best psych professor La Salle has to offer. I took him for abnormal psych. He is so kind. I found him funny. He gave three or four test and one presentation assignment. I got a B+ in his class. I would have received an A if I studied a little harder. I strongly encourage taking him if you ever have the chance.
5,I took Psych 101 with Joe in 1973 as an elective. It totally changed my direction in life. I became a therapist  I took three more classes with him before graduation and he was by far the most interesting an informative teacher in the department.
5,hes great  a funny and interesting guy. his tests are tough and you have to study. hes really personable though and looks out for his students well being. hes really friendly and his class isnt too hard.
4.5,He's witty  interesting  and dynamic. Classes are comprehensive and challenging  but worth your time and effort
5,He's definately the hardest teacher I've had at La Salle but an A is still possible for good students. It was boring at times but doable. He's really funny but plan on being there every wednesday for the entire class.
4.5,Brother Burke is a great guy... make sure you work hard  stay on top of things and you'll do fine. He's patient and always willing to help  but will not do everything for you so be responsible... I enjoyed his class a lot and learned so much!
5,He is awesome! Fun  great teacher and teaches well. His tests are straightforward and relatively easy if you stayed awake in class. He is really cool about helping you out but you have to ask!
5,Bro. Joe is the man! His tests are a little tough but he one of the best teachers ever!
4.5,Burke is an intelligent teacher who will teach even the most boring subjects with much personal interest an much intelligence. Also  he is understanding and his classes aren't as hard as they seem at first. Be attentive and contibute to class.
4,Professor is super easy so just show up  get the midterm and final (both are take home)  and you'll pass with an A. He gives one homework assignment that's due at the end of the semester  and it isn't too time consuming.
4,He goes off topic and gets into politics. He is a very successful investor and a former Special Operations naval officer. He is an expert on making money. If you want to get technical on details then take other professors but if you want to talk business in general terms then this is the professor to take.
1.5,He is a little rude when he talk. he is not organized  it seems like he never prepare for class. he just comes in and talk from his experiences. after this finance class I still don't understand stock market. he only answers question but how do i ask question when i haven't learned anything. i guess the class is for whoever already know.
4,The teacher is a little rude and sarcastic at first but he eases up on it in the long run.Easy class. Self taught course and collaborating with peers help. You need to network with peers. Take home final. Take home midterm. Instructor is absent a lot  but it's ok. At the end of the class you will have answers if you ask the questions. He loves qts
1,Repeats himself every lecture. Hands out syllabus but doesnt follow it. lectures off topic about world economy. We havent used the text at all yet but from my understanding we will be tested on it? so i suggest studying.I am supposed to be learning about investing in the stock and bond markets..but he hasnt taught us anything yet.
4,Had him for Bus 1 and personal finance. Very easy class  my book was hardly used except for tests. Lectures aren't very helpful for tests  but he does relate RL situations  through experience  to things in the text. Often absent  but I forgive him from his age. One of my fav prof  mainly from personality. Esy clas  teach urself if u want to lrn any
5,very easy professor as long as you do your work  go to the class  you will do fine on the test. He gives you answer before the final and he also give take-home quiz. very chill and experienced!
2.5,Yes  he OFTEN repeats himself and the class becomes repetitive and boring  his lectures are poor. he doesn't notify students when he's absent.He's rude with no reason at all.If you want to learn business take classes somewhere else
3,I took him for Business 1 (intro) and earned an A. now that im taking him for finance and marketing I've noticed that he OFTEN repeats himself and thus the class becomes repetitive and boring at times. he has a sense of humor  his lectures are fun but he's never there for office hours and he doesn't notify students when he's absent.
5,Nothing but praise for this professor. Very articulate & tells interesting stories that relate to class materials. Straight forward & he reviews before the midterm and final. Quizzes & tests are extremely easy as long as you read & pay attention (grades on curve). Take his class  you won't regret it & learn lessons that'll stick with you.
5,I took the fast paced class for Summer. I sat front row seats because I love his lectures. Very clear & he tells you what will be on the test! Professor grades on curve! He loves questions & is very experianced! He gives tons of examples! He doesn't take attendance daily but he does notice when someone isn't there! I got an A! HAPPY! GREAT TEACHER!
5,Great professor very clear about what he's talking about. No need to ask questions  everything that is wanted to know was answered
2.5,always late  missed 4 out of 15 classes. his lectures are useless  do not take notes but he takes roll sometimes so attendance does count. keep your papers that he hands back  he loses them and you get no grade for it. read the book and you'll be fine  pretty easy A
4,He knows his stuff  but does not cover the textbook thoroughly. He tests on some things not discussed in class. Don't count on the lecture. You need to read the text. He does give helpful info and good real life examples. He requires weekly reports on an article from the Wall Street Journal.
5,Very good teacher..hard test though
5,Very Helpful Teacher! Learn alot in class. Give great tips in everything you want to know - from starting your own business to stocks. Enjoyable class.
5,No Comments
1,I would not take again she can be rude and snobby. Very opinionated and vocal about it. She gets too dramatic in her lectures  made me want to fall asleep. Her tests were so unorganized it was so frustrating. Knows a lot of information but lacks substance. Doesnt reply to emails  when she does its vague. Takes long to grade assignments.
4,She might seem intimating  but that's only because she cares about her students. She is very knowledgeable about the subject and answers any questions you ask her. Her lectures are long  but always interesting. You'll pass the class as long as you do your reading  take notes and do the projects.
2.5,Unclear and seems to enjoy conflict.
3.5,Ms. Yearwood overall a great teacher  she can be confusing with dates for assignments and projects  but overall she is very knowledgeable about the subject  if you just read the chapters you will do fine.
3.5,She is a really good teacher and you can tell she cares about the students. You will have to work for your grade in her class. She wants us to succeed but she's not just going to give you what you don't earn. Her lectures are long & sometimes they make you want to sleep. She's very informative though.
2.5,There is no question she would not do anything to help her students. But she does not know how to teach. She spends most of the class going off on her soap box about stuff that has nothing to do with the course. Than she will not allow a break and makes you do all her test in the testing center on your time. Don't take her for Chef 1305/HAMG 1321
4,Ms. Yearwood class can be intensive sometimes. But  she is a very good teacher makes sure you learn the material and expects you to remember it. Can be funny at times and mean at the same time. She does a lot for her students and the school. Can be a great advisor.
4.5,Fun and full of excitement. You must follow directions and listen carefully. In the beginning it may be easy but near the end of the semester she will give you projects with very simple and sometimes incomplete instructions but she expects you to do them and to make it perfect. She will also tell you due dates only once  so pay attention.
4,I've been reading some of the other comments made about Ms. Yearwood and I don't get it. She is very informative and obviously a very intelligent person. Just because she expects you to do your work...Because it's College...doesn't make her a bad teacher.
4,Shes a good teacher. She knows her stuff & isnt easy. If you're in the class to learn you'll be ok. If you're there because you have to be  you'll have some trouble.She gives a lot of assignments. She really does care about the culinary students & she can be in a rush w/ everything she has to do at the school. your not just another student w/ her.
1.5,Class only offered online. Extremely poor communicator. Class requirements very clear. Tests extremely long-too much material per test-should break down test to be more manageable. Do extra credit. Do publisher's online study until you receive 100% on ea. Do study guides. MEMORIZE. I earned A but not without extreme effort! Not many earn A I'm told
1,She makes no sense. 30 min. lectures for a simple yes no answer. takes class on a kitten tour on last day of class. Give me a break do that on day one. seems overwhelmed and borders on mental illness. Student beware she is the worst.
5,If you are at all serious about learning health and sanitation  Yearwood is the gal for you. It sticks with you long after you have left her class and you use it at all times. Clean hands  right temps for food  handling and receiving. Your future employer will be impressed!
1,This woman is terrible. She won't return emails and she's not easy to talk to. I dropped the class. I haven't spoken to anyone who likes her.
1.5,"She's like a rent-a-cop on a power trip that takes delight in failing (or hurting GPA) her students. Takes ~1 wk to respond to emails w/vague answers not pertaining to the subject/question. The most useless  unrealistic & worst ""instructor"" I've ever had."
5,there are not words to explain that she is a wonderful skilled teacher. she knows the material and she is willing to help you any time. you have to remember she is clear and direct in her instruction. her projects are straigh foward as long as you follow each step in her instructions.
1,I took her telecourse class. It was very hard because the information on the study guide did not match the information on the tests. She is a hard grader. When I tried to e-mail her w/ any questions she would only leave a vague answer.
1,I took her telecourse. One of the most difficult classes I've ever taken  the lecture tests were not easy but that wasnt the hard part of it. u had to figure things out on ur own  making an A in her class is not easy  the only class (except for the nursing classes)that I didnt make an A in.
4,Knows her stuff - maybe too well! Hard classes but only because she cares. You will have to study. Want to learn? Take her classes.
5,great teacher. her specialty is nutrition and saftey and sanitation. show up  do your work  and interact in class and you will do great. she doesnt sugar coat anything so dont get your feelings hurt. RECOMMENDED.
2.5,Does not stick with in her own grading rubrics. Changes assignments at the last minute. Does not follow her own syllabus. Talks about herself a lot in class. For papers  grades on a five point scale. A four will drop you to an eighty  a three to a sixty. Extra credit is not helpful to your final grade.
4.5,Only college class i was sad to see end. Cardozo has a huge heart and loves connecting with her students and being able to believe in their abilities. She's inspirational and centered. If you have a chance to take a course taught by her and its a smaller classroom  you will benefit greatly.
2,Professor Cardozo is super helpful  and one of the best in English/American Studies to incorporate issues of politics and identity into her coursework. She's super smart  and really sweet. Definitely take a class from her.
2.5,Interesting assignments.
1,No Comments
3,--
1,she has a bad personality
3,No Comments
4,I enjoyed her class &her teaching style  & the independence in our assignments
1.5,No Comments
5,he's awesome. Lots of blackboard work  but he's really helpful and makes things interesting.
3,Dan is hot but he is a loner and does have an egotistical side. He does think that he knows it all and he is good w/ communications but not good w/ people in general
4,No Comments
4.5,Was able to explain and apply most everything very well. But he also thought he knew everything. Very fair on grading papers and test.
1.5,Egotistical!
4,No Comments
2.5,No Comments
2,Very full of himself. Class was easy enough  I guess but he really thought he was a lot smarter than he really is.
4.5,Not a course for linear thinkers but the instructor was very good.
4,Beth was a very good teacher. She used the book a alot and there were 4 major projects the whole semester. She was a bit unorganized sometimes but very friendly and helpful. If you had any questions she would do her best and very leniant at times. Overall if you go to class and do the work you will pass. Good teacher
4.5,I took her MASS COMM LAW class. Was it hard? Yes. It's a law class. She makes the information so acessible and loves to engage the students in discussion. It doesn't help when half of the kids in class don't pay attention then complain about their grades. We're adults. Show up and study hard! She did a great job and miss taking her class.
1,Not prepared and uniformed!
4.5,Overall I good teacher
5,She's a character.
5,Intro course  excellent instructor  very helpful and friendly.
4.5,This teacher is very helpful! If you have a chance to pick your professor he is great!
5,She is the most organized professor I've ever had! And the class was fun. Wasn't looking forward to it at all but it was great. She's no pushover  but as long as you come to class and do the assigned work you'll be fine.
5,Erin is a great teacher!!!! So helpful and makes everyone feel very welcome. She is extremely positive and understands that most people are not comfortable with speaking in front of a class! I totally recommend taking her for COM 150! We all have to take so you may as well enjoy it! She is GREAT!
5,probably best college class I had so far. fun and useful. made alot of friends in this class.
5,I had such a good time in class last night I thought I'd post this. She does unusual(fun) stuff and keeps us on track.
5,I had thought outlining was over rated but what I learned in this class just got me thru a presentation in my new job. I was the best presenter in my training group. I am braggin! You'll work in her class but now I feel it was worth it.
1,Worst teacher ever! closed minded even kept us late a couple of times! Take my advice advoid this teacher!! Hardest Entry level speaking class!
2.5,May have been knowledgeable
3.5,Erin is a sweet girl  the stupid outlines she makes us do is rediculous. That is where she takes most of her grades from. This class should not b as hard as it is. At first it was fun. We played some games. Her quizes r horrible. Shes not a quick responder via emails. She does care alot about ur grade and will try to help you. Dont get ur hopes up.
5,I failed Com 150 then took Prof. Finn's evening class and it was great. I thought she was an awesome teacher. She was very specific and detailed in outlining the chapters. Very helpful and enthusiastic. She gave great feedback after giving back speeches. Easy A or B+.
2,She wasn't a bad teacher  but her lectures were confusing. She didn't seem the friendliest person. I dropped her class... let that be a hint for you all....
3,i should have done better in that class... shes tough when she grades the outlines
3,This teacher only teaches a few classes here. She was ok. Not particularly difficult  not a bad person  but was close minded to different creative approaches to public speaking.
5,Jim is a really good professor   hes clear and takes the extra time to help you. He hates when people are late and or miss alot of class. As long as you really make an effort hell teach you as much as you want to learn. Perspective drawing was tough and very precision heavy. Better if youve taken drawing 1 beforehand
5,Best art teacher hands down  I learned so much from his classes and improved dramatically under his wing. He definitely cares about his students and will go the extra mile for students!
5,Jim is by far the best art instructor I've had at ELAC. His dedication and level of expertise are unparalleled. I've learned so much from him. Without hesitation  I enthusiastically recommend him to anyone.
5,Best art instructor I've had so far.
5,Best Art Professor that I have had! I love how each of his assignment taught me something new!
5,Inspirational teacher! He is there for you  if you need help don't be afraid just ask! expects you to try in class and on your assignments. Do not take his class for granted you will learn to pick out your own mistakes overtime :)
4.5,to be honest he's not very hard at grading if you do exactly everything he says. the main reason why people get B's and not A's is because they try to take shortcuts. Don't do that here. He's very strict but very easy to get along with outside of class. (:
5,I took Jim for multiple classes and in each of his classes I've learned a lot. Took him for life drawing twice  intro to painting  oil painting  and drawing 3.
4.5,He is a great teacher  gives constructive criticism all the time. He uses a lot of repetition  which got pretty boring to me after half of the semester. He grades you based on your final portfolio mostly and daily sketches. We only used the book about two times. He is strict and does not like ppl who are constantly late &the nude models are cool!
4.5,Very likely the hardest working and most dedicated instructor that I have seen in a while. Will push students to do their very best and works hard to make sure students have a good learning environment. Be warned  he is tough and will not take any BS. Come on time  come prepared  and work hard for your grade!
5,If u hv passion and wanna learn a lot of drawing  Jim will help u a lot. He is good at not only teaching art but also helpful for letting u know what is right thing to do in your life. Show him your effort and u will do great.
1.5,I don't like how this teacher grades  some student I did better got better grades than I did for some reason
1,This professor is no good at all. I felt like I wasted a lot of money on supplies not important for learning.
1.5,This teacher is terrible  tells stories half the time and although he is hard on you  it doesn't help if he does not teach much.
4.5,He was a really good teacher he helps me to be a better student
2.5,He's good at the subject and u do learn from his class. However  he sees attendance way more than efforts u put in. He wouldn't bother to know ur unforeseen difficulties. Just be there on time even ur body or situations not allow u to do so. Keep ur finger cross that ur body won't fail u or run into any kind of emergencies during the 16 weeks.
5,Everyone is entitled to their opinion. Jim won't ever criticize any artwork  but will give his opinion to improve on it meaning take it home and touch up on it for the final portfolio. You can't be lazy in his class or you will get the grade you deserve. He will give you his undivided attention as long as you need.
4.5,I'm not going to lie  this class is pretty hard. Granted  I got an A but I had already taken 2 regular drawing classes before and worked really hard. Jim is a good professor
4.5,Jim is a great teacher  Ive had him for 5 times as a teacher. If you dont like to draw or your a slacker dont take his class  youll be wasting his time as well as the other class mates. If your competitive and want to improve on your drawing then this his class. In my opinion  anyone who has gave a bad remark is full of it.
2.5,this guy is just like a sales representative and I didnt learn so much in the class. don't take his class unless you want to waste alot of money  if you do please find ways to get the textbooks for cheaper
3,EASY CLASS. Attendance isn't mandatory. You buy the book  read it and do the online assignments. If you want to actually learn  take another class  if you want an easy A. Take this class. He also doesn't keep you for the full hours of the class.
1,He started the class 3 days after the short semester started. He's very unclear with instructions and doesn't respond to emails. He's not involved with the class and the program is what will be teaching you and grading your work. The program is extremely specific in how it wants you to answer homework/exams questions which is extremely frustrating.
2,All i can say is if you want to learn in this class take someone else.
1,Easiest class I've ever taken. If you know how to do the bare minimum in Microsoft Office  you can get an A. Don't bother showing up on time  because he sure as hell doesn't. He makes you print out your assignments  so be prepared to spend money on the print service. He's old and confuses himself a lot  so be prepared to teach yourself.
3.5,You definitely need the book because of the online code. Only 3 tests during the term. Easy homework and assignments. If you have essential knowledge in Microsoft office you won't have problems getting a good grade. Sometimes is not clear explaining in class but not a bad teacher. PD: If you ask him many questions he might get mad sometimes. lol.
3,Buy the book from the bookstore! Do not buy the online code without the book. The book is a must. Easy Class. Gives Extra credit. Basics for Excel  Word  Access  and Power Point. Only gave 3 exams throughout the semester. Sometimes/a lot of times forgets stuff class had to remind him. Overall an easy class. I would recommend him. Nice teacher.
3.5,I'm currently taking him. His class is the easiest class i've ever taken. Not disrespecting him. I like to think i'm pretty tech savvy and i like technology  but for someone who doesn't use: word  excel  access  and somewhat hardware i can see them having a tougher time. Easy A. He is a fair grader  gives a lot of time for work  and tests.
3.5,I took this class on summer 2015. Professor is so nice  he always helpfulness. But he cant give good grade  and I dont think is easy about his test. I just got grade B on this class  that so sad. You need buy his book cause have code with that book   his all test online.
3,Okay professor. He teaches at the beginning of class and then you do your own work. His tests are online  so better buy the code or you would not pass. The test is exact as the online work  so just review and you'll be okay. The only con is that he can be boring  but that's college.
2,This class was too easy. I seriously could have done it in my sleep. If you know the basics of power point  word  excel  and access you will get an A. Just show up  participate and turn in your assignments on time. This class could be hard for anyone with very limited computer skills  but for most it will be the easiest class of their academic path
5,Enomoto is the nicest teacher of all time. He is very chill and does not yell. He also explains thing very well!
5,WORK HARD  PLAY HARD  he always says that. He's veryful and understanding always making the class interesting.
3.5,Easy class. He is a bit unclear with his instructions at times though. He *never* answers pm's on etudes. I took it online and you have to come to campus for the exams & final. Textbook with required homework assignments is very overpriced. If you understand computer basics  then this is an easy A class.
1.5,Eaaaasssyyyyyyy!!! But talks very fast  gets kind of mad when you ask questions cause you are confused. Anyways would recommend if you need credit/units. Easy A.
5,Great overview of computer technology. Course content and exercises were straight forward  easy to understand. Prof. Enomoto is friendly and patient. Highly recommend his class as the lead into CO SCI 200. Am a little richer for the knowledge both reviewed and gained here.
5,This was my first class. Did all assignments  did pretty good on the Quizzes. His a good Professor. Reviews the work with you just in case you missed any assignments. I really learned how to use the Microsoft programs and the different stuff u can do. I highly Recommend him. Easy A.
5,"This class is stress free. If you want an easy ""A"" take Mr. Enomoto You don't need a textbook. The final is so Easy and its a take home. No mid Term. Forgot the most important thing Mr. Enomoto lets you leave early to do your homework in the lab. That's if you have any h/w because he lets you do his homework in class. Regardless you leave early."
5,This class is an automatic A if you do you work the right way which is really easy. Not to mention  there are extra credit opportunities given so take advantage of them. The test grades are based on a curve
4.5,"Mr. Enomoto  is a really nice instructor. If you want to get an ""A"" you need to take this class. He lets you leave early this way you have time to go to the lab to do your homework. He also  will give extra credit toward the end of the semister."
4.5,"Mr. Enomoto  is a very nice instructor. He is helpful and he is very easy. What I liked about his class was that he would let you out early to go to the lab to do your homework. If you want an ""A"" you need to take him."
5,a wonderful professor
5,Everything good that a professor is expected to be. I provided much more detailed feedback on Scrutiny
5,Professor Teng is lovely and gracious! As a Mount Holyoke student  I definitely found the trip worthwhile.
5,Love professor Teng. She is always well prepared  and very helpful
4,nice  but tough. you have to study EVERYDAY to do well
3,terrible sense of humor...but tries hard  willing to go out of her way to improve the class in general. overall ok  althugh i prefer prof. shen.
3.5,helpful  attentive  and works hard at her lessons.

5,My favorite professor so far. Calm  cool  easy going and informative. A+ Alison! :)
5,I recommend another baking instructor...Alison bakes like Lynn Mattie and teaches Dining Room Service like Beth Sonnier!
4,Another good one. Knowledgable and helpful. Needs to increase her degree of difficulty. A little too basic.
4,Alison is a great teacher. I would recommend her for any baking/pastry class. She is a real Chef with real experience.
5,Good instructor for baking and dining room service classes. Clear  knowledgeable  knows the material. Always willing to help you out. Will work with each and every student.
4.5,Good attitude  very willing to help students  gives constructive feedback
4,His postive spirit helps students when the going gets tough. He is very kind and willing to help.
5,No Comments
5,Can't say anything negative about this guy. He cares about helping students learn and it shows  just look at all his teaching awards.
5,There is definitely a lot to learn from him. Pay attention to all he does  his techniques are great.
1,Instructor is horrible. Does not matter if you bust you butt or sit on it everyone gets the same grade. Does not require participation so most students walk and a few do all of the cleaning. Not a fair instructor. Too laid back.
5,Bill is easily one of my favorite teachers. He makes the class fun and his teaching methods work great. I would definitely recommend taking his class!!!!!
2,Avoid if at all possible. Class and instructor are a waste of time.
4.5,Great instructor  let's you out early all the time.
5,Great Chef and teacher. Just wished they would let him teach during the day.
5,I really enjoy his class  he is helpful and he teaches excatly what is going to be on the test. Awesome Teacher! Recommended
4,What Allison is to baking  he is to cooking. Offers good advice. He's been there  done that. Listen to him.
5,Bill not only will teach you things that are required for the class but he will offer advice and suggestions to all that seek it.
4,He is a great teacher. He is very nice and helpful. I highly recommend this teacher. He is a real Chef with real experience.
5,Like his wife  Bill is a very good kitchen and bakery instructor. Helpful  friendly  good at teaching. Recommended.
4.5,Chef Chris is wonderful and a must have here at El Centro  you wont be disappointment with his as an instructor. He does get upset if you don't listen and follow instructions.
5,Chris is a great teacher! I will take her class again if I can register within the 7 minutes it takes for her classes to fill up.
5,No Comments
5,Very knowledgable instructor. Very imaginative. Nice  easy-going person. Take this fun class.
5,What a sweetheart! So talented. I can not say enough good things about this teacher. A+ Awesome!
5,Best Cake Decorating instructor. Nice  friendly  easy-going. Always willing to help.
4.5,Read your book and you will make an A.You must read and pay attention to the lectures!!
5,Tool online class. Very easy. Answers questions and concerns in timely manner. Very flexible. Took him for both classes and made east A's  still remember what I learnt.
4,I took Mr. Goff for Summer 1 online. I loved the class! It's very easy and he tells you clearly what you have to do to pass his class. I made a B and I was throughly pleased with his class!
1,lectures are BORING.....Tests are hard because he doesn't talk about the material on them....learned absolutely nothing from his class.
3,I like this professor
3,If you like to read and memorize the textbook  you can take him for you psychology class. He's not an easy A teacher for me. He only give the extra credit for doing a volunteer job. nothing else for extra credit. I didn't have any attraction for psychology  his lecture isn't fun or interesting. He use slide and TV (not a fun show)for teaching.
2,He thinks he is cerebral?
2.5,Hes really funny when he gets going its just those stupid take home tests and in class tests that he gives us that suck! I mean he goes on and on about stuff that isnt even on the test!
4.5,This guy was just plain boring. He's a little sensitive too.
3,He is nice and makes the cleass interesting
5,He makes this class interesting.
1,No Comments
1,Has no respect for the people who are trying to earn a living  and ask for his help to get through his class
2.5,His lectures are long sometimes they can be interesting but other times he just talks and talks.
4,No longer teaching. Professror Emeritus. Laid a good foundation for future teachers to model. His clarity of thought and instruction has helped me in my upper level courses. Master teacher
5,Dr. Velleman - and though I took his class nearly 22 years ago - provides a good structural framework for how to approach statistical analysis in general. It helps develop a sense of how it should be done. Listen to this brilliant man. It will do you good. The class I took 22 years ago had a different code  so this is my best guess what it is now.
4,sounds like someone who did not pass the course last Spring semester got on and tried to repeatedly slam him. He did not even teach the Fall  2016!
2,The lectures were actually pointless for this class. MAKE SURE YOU READ THE TEXTBOOK!!! I learned all the stats I know from the textbook not him.
1,We use DataDesk  a program he invented 30 years ago instead of something more modern. His ego is so big we can't use a real stat program since it was made by someone else. Makes it very difficult to get help cause no one knows how to use his program
1,He loves the sound of his own voice. Take another professor if you really wanna learn stats
2,"Promises to be ""your statistician for life"" but ends up talking down to students and using the class to inflate his own ego. Excessive number of ambiguous problems from an overpriced textbook he wrote himself. Take another professor for this required class if you can"
1,I've never heard of having to do papers in a math class but we have almost weekly papers on concepts he hasn't even taught yet
1,I was amazed that someone could have such a large ego. He acts like he's too good for an intro to stats course  but I think he only teaches it since he gets to sell his textbook to all his students. It's a lousy textbook with many typos and every student pays $130 that goes right to his pocket
4.5,Very clear lecturer  excited about statistics. Does have an ego but you don't interact with him much anyway. If you study and practice with the questions at the end of the chapters  you'll do well on the exams. Put in the work and you'll learn Stats. I understand the subject so much better now. Take this class  you won't regret it.
2.5,Fine at best. He is disgustingly arrogant. However  if you can get past his ego he is more concerned that you understand statistics overall opposed to just the math behind it  which is good. Some days he can be very boring. Tests are fair and papers (yes papers  quite a few of them) are not terrible at all. Overall not terrible but not enjoyable.
4,The class is super easy. Go to lecture and do the homework and you'll be set. He bumps everyone up a huge amount at the end of the year.
5,"I took intro stats and although Velleman is known for ""taking the math out of stats"" the stuff you learn is really useful and applicable to the naturalsocial sciences. And he's super approachable. If you study  you'll do well. When he says he's taking the math out  he just means you don't have to do rote calculations"
2.5,Takes all the math out of statistics  which has its positives and negatives. Weekly homework and various different assignments required. Tests are tough and require a large amount of critical thinking. Class can be painfully boring at times. Best part of the class is the textbook which Professor Velleman wrote himself. Easy textbook to read.
5,Great textbook written by him
4.5,Velleman is an excellent teacher. I actually enjoyed reading the textbook (which he wrote)  due to its conversational style and interesting examples. He posts all his lectures online  so attendance is not mandatory. If you choose not to go  you should still watch the lecture videos - they help with the homework.
4.5,I loved this class. Velleman is excellent professor  perhaps the best I've had so far at Cornell. I had no experience with Statistics before his class  but his lectures and textbook were so clear. You can tell that he knows his concepts inside out and he's great at explaining them. I strongly recommend him.
4.5,Great guy  conveyed a lot of passion about the subject  and gave a great intro to statistics. He really understands what he is teaching and to whom  and the class is well structured  even though there was some confusion about the textbooks/DVDs. He was also very democratic as to grading exams  removing confusing questions post-exam.
4,Good professor.
5,Easily one of the best (ILR) professors out there. The way he teaches eliminates the need for traditional math or calculations  and instead  requires you to critically think and understand data. He's exceptionally smart  but very approachable. Tests are fair  but can be tricky
2.5,Not the best teacher around  but a nice guy. Amazing knowledge of subject matter. Do all the readings and go to class and you should do well. Willing to help in office hours/after class. Test questions can be either overly vague or demand an unreasonable amount of detail. Okay overall class.
3,I don't know why Larry's getting such a bad rap... sure he's not the best teacher around  but he's a nice guy and will amaze you with his sports knowledge. Just do all the readings (which are mostly interesting) and write everything you know on the essay tests and you'll be fine. The baseball salary arbitration paper is really fun. Not a hard class
1,this professor is the worst ever  someone forgot to remind him that he has a duty as a teacher as well as a researcher...thanks larry
3,Kahn seems to know a lot about Labor Econ but I could not get past the constant licking of the fingers. In a 50 minute lecture  the guy stuck his hands in his mouth over 60 times  I counted - I've heard varying accounts approaching 80. The class had 4 professors and I think I learned the least from Kahn - just not a great teacher but very knowledgable.
4,he is a tad boring  but he can explain the material well.
2,awful
3,I was really interested in sports bargaining but this class was not the appropriate forum for it. Kahn takes too much time trying to cover things that are repetitive  boring  and not necessary for the exams. The presentations are fun to work on  but you also need a good group to do it with.
2.5,Not very clear in his explanations. Lectures tend to be pretty boring. Funny jokes sometimes.
1,No Comments
1,No Comments
2.5,the lectures are really unorganized... he just rambles about whatever he feels like that day.
2.5,The class had 4 professors! Kahn's section was the worst. Having 4 professors hurts grades and understanding of the material.
3,Mr Pouncy believes no student deserves an A. This is his teaching philosophy. His stories are interesting. His teaching is good  but not good enough to produce students capable of A quality work. If you need an A to get into the nursing program or just for the sake of learning how to do high quality work  pick another teacher.
4.5,I took this professor for both ENG 1301 and 1302 and I enjoyed the class. He made the early 7:00 class interesting because most like myself  were worked nights. I believe he is a hard talent to follow in his field. The professor is there to help you write scholarly papers. He's job is not to hold your hand through the process.
4,Mr. P. was very helpful to me. This was my first year at college and taking Eng. so some things were a little bit dificult for me  but with the help of Mr. Pouncy  I was able to pass the class  and I thank him for all that he has helped me with.
2,I took his class and got a B. I deserved an A. It bothered me that once I worked at El Centro I would hear him tell the faculty he never gives out A's because no one deserves one. The only reason he's still teaching is he's good pals with the president. It's a shame fools like him are allowed to even be employed at a college.
1.5,An smarter person  but a very bad teacher. there were only 2 essays and 1 final. Fist one I got a C  with some many marks  the sec. one i gave my best to get a A  and i got another C with almost any mark correction  90% of the class got C  only 10% B  NOBODY GOT A  I decided to drop the class
1.5,This professor is not interested in giving you a true education. He is interested in the extent to which he can persuade other people to reinforce his very aggressive and prejudiced political agenda. Do not take Pouncy's class if you are white  female  or shy. You can only achieve an A grade if you agree with his views.
3.5,One thing about Mr. Pouncy  he talks about his gun alot. He has alot of stories  but generally not a bad teacher. Even though it was back in Fall 2007  it wasn't bad.
2,Took Pouncey in 2002. Wish this was around then. I felt terrible after attending his class and feel much better after hearing everyone elses comments.
1,"Any teacher who continually preaches about racial issues and cannot move on is not worth listening to. Mr. Pouncy is still harping on the atrocities of the past rather than finding resolutions for the future. I sat in this joke of a class for 2 days..couldn't take it. I am an ""A"" student when it comes to writing  but this wasn't worth it."
3.5,Now  to finish my review from below...I sat in the back of the class room all semester and hardly ever spoke. I think it took him most of the semester to remember my name. I completed all of my essays and made a B in the class. Yes  his stories did get old  especially when he repeated them  but he is one of the best professors that I have had. A
4,I think that everyone of you that has written a bad review about Mr. Pouncy should reflect on why you received the grade that you did. If it is hard for you to figure out what he wants from you then you need to take his advice and visit him during his office hours (just like he tells you). If writting is hard for you then take someone else!
5,Fun class with great discussions. Put in the work and you'll be fine - after all this is college! Essay topics were weak  though. Made an A.
1.5,"his class is super hard!!! what you call hard!:P if you want an ""A "" your ""A"" will turn out to be a ""C"" or if he really really does like you  a ""B"". he's a good person from the inside  but not a great teacher!"
1,I had to drop Mr. Pouncy's class after hearing about African American history for four classes in a row. I'm not so sure he's cut out to be a teacher  or if enjoys the teaching aspect or the grading aspect better.
2,he expects you to be at his level of knowledge regarding literature and the world in general. he would be off teaching at major university with his phd. this is a community college  not harvard!
5,great professor. gets class thinking
4.5,Mr. Pouncy is a Great English Teacher  but you will not get an easy grade in his class  you have to work hard  and he does challenge his students only because he wants to prepare them for university level...Pouncy always informed us that we are the only one that can truly increase our knowlegde and become effective at being a good student...I am am
4,sometimes smart people are hard to approach. he knows what hes talking about just is very unique in his delivery.
2,He is a very intelligent man. His teaching however  lacks. He talks all class about random subjects that are interesting. The final was a killer. Hard grader.
1,Believe me don't take Pouncy's class.You are not gonna get any thing from either Grade or good knowledge.So why you spent your money and valuable time for nothing !!
3,If you want an A - take this class! He is extremely knowledgeable in his field  but not real computer saavy. Copy the questionsanswers to all PowerPoints down as you will need those for the online tests for each chapter. Classmates are loud and rude to him and take advantage of his kind nature. No final-just show up to get your final grade.
3.5,he is really easy if u want to really understand and know things from his class i advice you to take another person. he is an easy A all you have to do is come take attendance and leave if u want but he just makes you work on the test questions. witch are on line. if u need a humanities class take him he is easy.
3.5,Jerry is a very thoughtful person and truly understanding. I have completed my music composition classes through him and he has helped me immensely. Often  he will leave the classroom and not return for some time. I have had to deal with loud and obnoxious rude classmates because of this but overall  I would recommend any of his classes.
4,Took online class. Very easy. Some of the answers are wrong on the tests and after showing him where it said otherwise in the book he quickly changed the grade. He will reopen tests if you want a better grade. Never met but I would recommend.
4.5,Very easy class...if taken in the classroom. The online class has to do much more work than the on-campus class  and from what I've seen  Mr. Jones is not very computer savvy. SO  if you want an easy A for Humanities  take his class  but NOT online. Tests are open book! And if you are genuinely interested in Humanities  Mr. Jones has a lot to say.
1,If you take his class online  you must understand that he will take forever to e-mail you back. You have to get the book for the assignments.The work is easy and you don't have to read the book  just skim for the answer. (Or if you can look them up). He didn't really instruct us well. I wouldn't recommend.
2,If you take this teacher online he is useless. Don't know how to work ecampus will receive incorrect grades and when you email him about it good luck getting a response
1.5,"Jerry Jones is a useless teacher  his students have no idea what they are missing as far as higher music theory education goes. I feel sorry for students who take their first two years of college theory from him  because they are going to be in for a rough ride when they transfer . Mr. J is ""nice"" but definitely not suited to teach college."
5,He is extremely helpful! He was more than willing to do all he could to ensure that I understood the content! Professor Jones is a wonderful teacher.
4.5,mr jones is awesome he is all of the music student's hero he is helpful and real laid back. anyone could get along with him. he is the koolest :)
5,the class is very easy he gives you the answers to the tests on a study guide.
3,Class is structured to get an A. However some folks are lazy and expect to earn an A from your effort. The tests are taken at the students convience in testing center. Most classmates will wait until you take the test and try to borrow your graded scantron and cheat off your efforts. Part of grade is attendance
4.5,That is a easy class
3,Quite enjoyable. Just wish he'd use a little more explanatory textbooks.
5,thoroughly enjoyed him as a teacher and as a person...very helpful.
5,I think Mr. Jones is a great teacher  and he was very willing to work around my schedule and help me whenever i had questions :)
4.5,class work is individualized  goes out of his way to help students that ask

4,Professor Corvino is fantastic! He is funny and caring. This class consisted of a lot of reading and only 4 exams so come to every class and study hard for the exams!
4.5,Corvino was an excellent lecturer. He kept the class engaged and interesting. Definitely read the course pack and participate in class. Discussion portion seemed a bit pointless to me sometimes however the lecture itself was wonderful. Exam questions were confusing and tricky at time but the workload is not much!
4.5,Invokes discussion  and provides useful feedback. My only issue is the amount of reading  and the exams require you to remember specific points from all readings. TA's do the grading so be sure to ask them what they look for! Not the easiest course  but Corvino's lectures are sure to get you thinking about things from a new perspective. Smart guy.
5,Great professor  makes things easy to understand. Follow along during lecture and you'll be fine.
5,Professional Ethics was maybe the most interesting and engaging class I have taken at Wayne. Corvino wanted us to be involved in the discussion and found a way to make a potentially boring subject really interesting. If you came to class and read the material then you were pretty much set up for an A. I definitely recommend a class with him.
5,One of my favorite courses at WSU! Corvino is very engaging has a light personality  which gets you interested in the material. Make sure to keep up on all the readings and come to every class as his insight into the readings gives much clarity. Very helpful when needed. Exams are not difficult if you follow the readings and notes he gives.
4,Dr. Corvino is very smart individual and a good professor. His course was fair. There are a lot of readings so make sure to keep up with them and actually understand them. Four exams (all with the same weight) make up the grade  so prepare well in advance for them.
4.5,Good teacher  class isn't too hard. Only problem I had was my final grade was an 89.7% and I still got a B+! Oh well...
4,Some of this stuff can be confusing or not interesting for most people. There are a lot of readings so be prepared. The number one mistake is not showing up to class. His lectures and class discussions give a lot more clarity to the content. Not bad  but kind of a demanding prof.
1.5,Extremely difficult professor for a general education course requirement. Gives WAY TOO MANY readings and does not understand that we have other classes and majors. His exams are too tricky. Do NOT take him if you want an A.
5,I had John Corvino for Contemporary Moral Issues  and it was by far my favorite class taken at Wayne. He is hilarious and makes discussions fun. He is open to everyone's opinion and does not force his on you. Overall an excellent professor! Strongly recommended!
5,there is no excuses for not doing well  his tests were straight off the notes  and their wasnt even that many notes to learn in the first place. Anyone who said it was hard or that he was bad simply did not try
5,He's the kind of professor every college student should experience at least once in their academic life. He's entertaining so the class never gets boring and if you have a problem and talk to him  he's very understanding. Just make sure to keep up with the reading and try to say at least one thing in class. He likes class participation.
5,Prof. Corvino is awesome! Make sure you come to class and read the material and you will do just fine. His TA's were awesome too. Very helpful and clear!
4.5,Amazing Professor! Smart as well as Handsome..you will be glued to your seat during his lecture.and go to office hours..HE WILL HELP YOU OUT!! I lovv him!! You have to study your material and show him you know stuff..clss is noy impossible as long as u know your stuff..
5,he is a awesome teacher im taking more philosophy classes just because of his teaching and because he is so hot
5,FANTASTIC...ACTUALLY!
4.5,very good professor. one of the best. you must come to class  pay attention  and do the readings. my only problem was learning phi lingo. but that was on me. not prof's fault. good class
4.5,Very hard class. The material is very mundane and boring. I did not do well in this class and I attended lecture when I could (had 18 credits)  read the material  and felt I did well on his tests but did horrible. TA was boring but enthusiastic. Corvino is very smart and loves his job but takes PHI too seriously. My worst grade in college thus far
3,This guy knows his stuff for sure  but this class is very hard. You have to be on top of all the reading and pay attention to every word he says in order to do well on exams. The exams are tough and composed of tricky multiple choice and essays. He can spot if you unsure in your essays and you will be marked down
4.5,Great professor! cute personality  really interactive with the class  not an easy grader when it comes to speeches  but if you do the work then you'll get a good grade
3,In my experience taking this class I noticed that Laidlaw wanted every one in the class to succeed and helped us every step of the way. Relatively easy and interesting class.
4.5,Ms. Laidlaw was an amazing professor. She's very energetic and sarcastic but  the class was def worth taking. She made the class fun. If you dont understand  you need to ask for help and she will give you a more in depth answer. Some of the speehes were a little cheesy but in the long run they help with being able to speak in public. Tests=easy!
1,She is very unprofessional and admits that she is biased. I have ALWAYS Aced speeches  I competed across the state on the speech team in high school and won multiple speech contests and scholarships... and got a B- in her class. You do the math. If you have to take her  focus more on winning her over than your speeches and you'll do well.
3.5,She's an okay teacher. Doesn't like when you disagree with her. Follow her outline and rules for speechmaking exactly. The final speech is really lame. Wasn't interested at all during the class. She is super hot though.
4.5,Laidlaw was an awesome teacher. She is very enthusiastic with teaching and brings energy to class every day. She grades fair and easy. I would take her again if i had the opportunity!
5,I loved this teacher! She made the classroom enviornment so comfortable. I have NEVER looked forward to a class before I took this one... and I HATE public speaking. The final is what lowered my grade to a B. But she gives you a heads up on what's going to be on it so make sure you study. I think she graded the speeches completely fair.
5,I don't know what you all are talking about. Rebecca was awesome. I never wanted to take this class but she was so fun and easy going I never wanted to miss a class! She is so down to earth and laid back. I love her!
3,Mrs. Laidlaw was an extremely resourceful teacher considering she teaches a subject more people would rather die than have to perform. Take her once a week class  she tends to cancel some of them. The final speech was optional! Also a really fun and interesting person and makes speech worth your while and money. Fair grader and gives good criticism
5,Rebecca Laidlaw is awesome... she wasn't as tough as these comments say she is. she makes everyone feel comfortable with speaking easily in fornt of the class by having everyone get to know one another... the class was acually FUN.
1,Didn't learn much. This teacher is not helpful and biased. Do not take this teacher if you have a major that requires public speaking.
4.5,She is a very energetic teahcer  very enthusiastic about her students. knows her material  definite reccomendation!
5,loved her. tough  but fun. gotta work for grade  duh!
4.5,I love her energy. But is a very tough grader  if you struggle take another teacher. I'm pretty sure the highest grade in the class was a B and those were very rare. You have to work hard for a C.
2,It is very frostrating when you're trying your best  put a lot of affort  which normally will help you to succeed  but as a result you get a low grade and the interest to give another speech is gone. If you have a chance to take another class  do so.
3.5,"She's young and spunky  a little chatty and a tough grader! Class is fun because she's so charismatic. She has lots of activities that make you comfortable speaking in front of the class so the ""big"" speeches aren't so intimidating."
4.5,Considering I'm terrible at public speaking  she was great at making me feel comfortable and giving me ideas on how to improve. More work= more practice= better knowledge of public speaking.
3,very cool teacher!
4.5,I think Rebecca is an awesome teacher. Yes  she does grade harder than others but thats made me try harder to get a better grade which isnt a bad thing. She makes learning fun! shes very sweet and I love her energy. I would definitely recommend taking her especially if your looking to have fun and learn at the same time. Good challenge!
3,She's very buddy-buddy with students  not professional  so the environment is very comfortable but at the same time she's a tough grader. She loves to talk about her personal life... A lot! She does convey important aspects of public speaking  though.
4.5,GREAT!!! I took his class over the summer at Moorpark college and kept up with him just fine. He gives real-life applications of the material throughout his lectures & exams. Has a traditional teaching style & provides book problems for help
2.5,"I got a ""C"" in his class and I studied my butt off. No office hours(he puts them 20 mins before class  but he's late to class sometimes  so it's basically like he doesnt even have them). his exams are difficult(but not unfair)  and he is not a good partial grader. if you miss 1 step and it screws up the whole problem  he takes off a lot of points.."
1,Yeah as we all know chem 102 is really hard. I have gotten A's in my O chem classes but Dr Berg is just purely an incompetent professor. If anybody who knew how to read english and write english with the help of periodic table thats him. Doesnt know a thing about teaching. His exams are from the VOO DOO land.Save urself..and run from him
1.5,Time for an honest review  I got a B in 101. Goes way too fast when explaining the lectures. How r you supposed to get ahead when you have no idea where in the book he is teaching from? He covers random sections in the book and uses different methods to teach material. I absolutely do not recommend this teacher!No office hours. Avoid at all costs.
4,Chemistry with any professor is HARD  the subject is HARD in general. Dr berg has years!! of experience and he really makes his lectures in a way where its understandable and applicable to exams. His exams are difficult but not tricky. Pay attention and take notes  make sure you don't make common student errors that he points out. AND PRACTICE Q's!
1.5,I would rather take a teacher that actually uses the textbook  believe it or not. The material he lectures does not even come from the book. Very easy to get lost.
4,excellent
5,GOOD GOOD GOOD JUST STUDY HARDDDD
3,Just finished his class to end spring 06. First glaring issue about him was he held no office hrs at all! This class is hard enough  and w/o office hrs  it was tough. But he reguarly checked his email when I had questions  he tried his best to answer them. His tests were on the hard side. you really have to study your butt off in his class. gl.
5,Great teacher  he is very helpful  lecture material is clear and understandable. Tests are mainly based on notes. Tests are not easy  but if you study the notes really well and attend class then youll do fine  plus he curves the class
5,Best Damn Chem teacher on campus. Very clear  makes topics easy  funny  worth changing your schedule around for!
5,Very Clear and understandable. one of the best teachers i have had so far.
5,you will love his sence of hummor  this is the best teacher I have had at CSUN. He will keep you interested in the material and motivated to come to class.
4.5,Great teacher  as long as u go to class and pay attention
5,I love Dr. Berg! He always includes the students and ask if we need more help. Go to class take very good notes and theres the test straight from lecture  but the lectures are not boring. No need to buy the book. He's great and helped me pass. he also teaches at Moorpark for Chem 101 take him!
5,"Highly adored. Very friendly and willing to help. He makes you feel comfortable learning the subject matter. Not an easy class. My ""B"" is well-cherished."
5,One of the very best teachers that I have ever had  IN ANY SUBJECT! He is an unusually highly skilled instructor  who is clear  and articulate. He makes the subject as fun and pragmatic as possible. His tests are hard but very fair.
5,LOVE Dr. Berg. Best Chem teacher ever. Learned and laughed. Tests are challenging  but isn't science? A true gem in the teaching profession.
5,Porof.Berg is a great guy  he makes the course interesting and fun  also he is clear with the material and makes it easy to understand  however  his test are a bit on the hard side  you must know the material inside out.
5,GREAT PROFESSOR! MAKES CLASS EASY AND FUN!
5,Good guy and some funny jokes during his lectures. Took him for G208 and it was an easy A.
3,Be prepared for lots of readings and bad jokes. Brilliant guy  just has terrible lecturing skills and tends to devote whole class periods to unrelated or unhelpful material.
3,Professor Knudsen is one of the most experienced and brilliant faculty in the IU Geography Department (perhaps in the entire university). His research spans many many sub-fields of the discipline. He teaches courses on food geography and theory. However  the courses I took with him involved industrial and economic geography. He is versatile!
2,He's a good guy but has terrible teaching methods. Most of the learning is done through wikipedia and in class presentations done by the students. The class had potential but his method of having students teach students is terrible. Lots of work for little reward.
4.5,VERY EASY CLASS. Gotta go to lecture to get the lecture notes tho. Midterm/Final are multiple choice with only option a b c. The discussion counts for 50% of your grade  and the discussion labs are supper easy. Plus  this class is real interesting  DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TAKING THIS CALSS
3.5,Ok class - he often made jokes no one would get. But he was a nice guy.
4.5,My best prof ever. Take his class if you can.
3.5,Knudsen's class was pretty cool. He's a nice guy and pretty funny  too.
4.5,And he's still helping me..
3.5,He was an easy teacher. He made jokes in class and the tests were fairly simple. You can easly skip class and still get an A.
3,No Comments
2.5,No Comments
2,He made promises he did not keep during the first week of class. By the time we got wise to him it was to late to drop the class.
1.5,I hated this guy!
5,No Comments
1,This teacher agravates me a lot. He said that students who are not good in math are mental retards. I'll always remember him as a cruel teacher!
1,No Comments
4.5,His tests r hard  but they r well worth it 'cos he helped create many good math teachers and engineers. A few of them r teaching now in Laney College  of course  with an easier approach to students.
2,He is so hard. You better be well prepared and be very knowledgable of Calculus I because he starts right into Calc II and doesn't look back. Confusing and has bad handwriting.
5,I had not taken algebra for over a decade when I signed up to take college algebra with Mr. Ream. He truly wants students to succeed and as long as you do the assigned homework and reach out to him if you are struggling  he is more than happy to do whatever he can to help. He tries to make math fun and gives curves on the exams - highly recommend
5,I am very fond of Mr. Ream. I've never done well with maths but I did very well in his class. He is patient and makes sure you understand the concept. He allows you to make up quizzes/tests for partial credit. He is old school  but that is partly why I enjoyed his class so much-easier undrstd. He is friendly and very sharp. I would take him again.
2,Professor Ream was a sweet old man and tries really hard to teach well  but it's a struggle. His lectures are wildly confusing and he goes off on tangents and abandons problems without actually showing us the answer. He gives a TON of extra credit and curves everything  so this class wasn't awful. If math is a tough subject for you  I'd stay away.
5,Mr. Ream goes out of his way to help you understand the material and he provides great feedback. He has a great sense of humor and is never afraid to admit when he's wrong. He loves statistics and used real life examples which made learning much easier. I really enjoyed the semester (Spring 2015) and would most certainly take another of his classes
2,Fred is nice as a person  but a terrible teacher. His lectures are confusing and top of that he will give you his own notes (looks like he used a typewriter) and expects you to understand them. He is old school  and very forgetful. I don't know anyone who is having it easy in this class. Very stressful and you need to make EXTRA time for this class
2.5,He truly is a nice old man and will help you but is very old fashioned. He gives out packets for you to learn the material basically on your own but let's you do test/quiz corrections which is nice. His lectures are basically just examples and can be disorganized. He wants you to write steps out but he skips steps himself which causes confusion.
2.5,I have to strain myself to understand what he is trying to say. He speaks so softly and goes off-topic so often that you lose track of where you are in the book. He skips sections entirely and gives out multi-page handouts expecting you to understand it. Lets you do corrections for half credit for the first two quizzes and tests and homework.
3.5,Mr. Ream wants all of his students to succeed and pass his class. He's very helpful and eager to make sure that students understand. His extra credit really helps out if you're struggling. He's old school and might seem like a mess with all his papers flying around  but he's on top of it. Highly recommend him for your 1330 Math class! :)
4,Fred is old school  he has corny jokes and uses a pop-up projector but he is an extremely nice teacher. I will admit his lectures are dry  but he is willing to explain and help students (JUST ASK FOR HELP). He lets you make up half points on quizzes and tests. If show up to class you will pass.
4,Fred is one of the best math teachers I have taken. He is always willing to help. I passed this class because of him. However  make sure you show up to class and don't miss a test!
4.5,Really hard subject but lets you correct quizzes!
3,Prof. Ream is one of the nicest professors out there. He's a little awkward but super patient and willing to help students. However  his lectures are disorganized and undefined. Math doesn't come easily for me so  although I'm a hard worker and I took lots of notes  I did have to spend a lot of time in the tutoring center to get a better grasp
1.5,I dropped this class. Dr. Ream is super nice and kinda a cute old man. He tries to make jokes but doesn't laugh at them so it just becomes awkward. Anyway  he is very hard to follow. Im bad at math as it is but I just could not go on in this class. His lectures are all over the place. Some classmates seemed to follow but I just did not.
5,Second chance teacher  allows for points to be made up.
3,So... He is the most confusing person I've ever heard speak. However  he can be so helpful if you JUST ASK FOR HELP. I really encourage going to office hours  they help a lot. And he really is a really great guy. You have to learn when to stop paying attention when it stops making sense.
2.5,If you have Dr. Ream  run for it! He's a nice guy  but a very confusing professor. His lectures are random and scrambled. He isn't organized. His tests are pretty hard vs the study guide he gives out  and don't even get me started on the online homework. It's completely awful! I would not recommend.
5,Excellent teacher. Very patient  allows corrections on most tests and assignments for credit. He also allows a fair amount of notes to use during quizzes and tests. If you go to class and write notes on everything he writes on the board  you will succeed. He is always willing to take time and help. I got an A in his class.
4,He's very patient and willing to help his students so much. His quizzes and and tests are not too hard. Tests are based on the quizzes. Highly recommended.
4,Fred will explain and re-explain it  he is patient and will help you outside of class! Great visual aids in the classroom!
4.5,Great Instructor. RECOMMENDED
5,Will tell you exactly how to do well in her class  and will never set any traps. The lectures are clear and she gladly answers your questions. She may look stern to some people but she is actually pretty approachable and has great sense of humor. Go to class if you need to  do the homework and her practice exams  and you will do well.
3,3D explanations are not her thing but over all easy class. If you do the assignements properly  easy A because her final is basicly questions from the book
5,Dr. Duma is one of the best lecturers in math. She explains in a way that makes it very clear what we need to know and what we don't. Her examples in class reflect directly what is going to be on the assignments/midterms and finals. She grades very fairly and is very kind. I would take her again!
4,Not the worst teacher  but certainly not the best. She is lazy in class and skips a lot steps which can lead to confusion. Might be a language barrier thing but she almost seems condescending when answering in-class questions. Her teaching style is to show you the process rather than the theory  which is not always ideal. Not a teacher for everyone
4,Duma will be a good fit for you if you're good at self-teaching. Her midterms/finals are made up of difficult textbook problems and are doable even without consistent class attendance. Would recommend.
4.5,She s a good teacher that makes sure her students understand very well. Her explications are clear. highly recommend to do previous midterms and finals which is really helpful.
4.5,Really good teacher  always tries her best to help and takes all her time to do so. Unlike several other teachers  she explains elaborately and her notes are so beneficial. Would take another class with her if I can. Thank you Ewa Duma!
5,excellent teacher  explains concisely and with much clarity  but you need to pay attention in the class to do well. The book pdf can be found online if you search for it.
3,Nice teacher  explains well. If you want to do good in MATH208 do past midterms and finals!! Sometimes similar questions come up and sometimes the EXACT question comes up with the same numbers! So whoever you have as a teacher just do past exams and understand the material
5,Good professor  there to help  clear and fair.
1,You need to learn to grow up  and study on your own.. Ignore the teacher  you need to put so much effort in this course  you need to do it on your own  you need to do so many questions  reading from the textbook is not enough. She is absolutely useless in class  unless u ask her to solve a specific problem in her office  is when shed be useful.
5,Very good prof. Explains the material very well.
4.5,She explains every thing really well and is extremely sweet with her students  makes sure they understand everything before moving on to another subject. The class is interesting but she makes it even more fun (that is  if you like math). She is truly an amazing teacher  she made my first semester much easier.
4.5,Amazing teacher. I loved her ! Go to your classes  spend some time reading over her past finals  and it's an A+ guaranteed.
4.5,Best professor ever! She is willing to help. If you follow her instructions  you can do great. I love her.
5,The best teacher ever. Her explanations are great and very clear. She is very nice and knows that you need plenty of examples to understand the material. All she does are examples in class which is the only way  in my opinion  that math should be taught. Go over her past practice exams  very very similar.
4,Easy marker. The beginning material is pretty simple so there's not much to discuss there. She does a pretty good job when the topics get a bit more complex  but since the course isn't proof-based there is quite a bit of handwaving when it comes to theoretical rigour (a necessary evil)
5,Probably the nicest lady you will ever meet  not to mention one of the funniest. Her lectures are simple  and she goes pretty quickly but stops if anyone has questions  or if she notices people are confused  and sometimes stays after class to offer extra help. The midterm and finally are easy  and if you understand the assignments you'll be fine.
4,Decent professor in class but the best outside if you need help. I've never had a prof try so hard to make sure her students understood the material. Genuinely a really really nice person and truly passionate about teaching
2,Very nice lady and she means well. But for me her explanations weren't clear & understanding what she was teaching was difficult. Do tons of practice problems watch PatrickJMT tutorials on youtube & go to tutoring in the math center. Just don't take her in the summer. Midterm & final were very similar to practice tests available.
5,Amazing teacher and extremely helpful. Some say she is tough but thats not true. Just attend class and dont be an idiot and youll do fine. Best teacher ever!
4.5,The best teacher this department has. Learned SO much! A valuabe resource of information both in and outside of class. She may be tough  but you'll learn alot. Again  the best teacher in the department!
5,Possibly the scariest 80 lb. person on the planet  but an excellent teacher. She knows everything about everything and is very fond of her overhead projector. Just attend the classes  make notes  study and don't worry that she doesn't seem to like you  it's nothing personal  she doesn't like anyone. You'll survive.
4.5,No Comments
5,Olga is there whenever to help you. Her over head notes a great and always the extra clarity thats needed is found within.
4.5,OLGA WAS A WICKED AWESOME TEACHER!! I WAS BLESSED TO BE TAUGHT BY HER!! SHE IS JUST SO INTELLIGENT!!!
2,Okay i regret not knowing that his tests are directly from his slides. Don't even read the book. I did that for the 1st two tests and failed miserably. Term project did great on. Aced the final. Explained why i did bad on 1st 2 tests and he wudn't bump me up. SO I WRITE FOR THOSE AFTER ME...STUDY THE GAMIMENa SLIDES! U WILL GET AN A.
3,I learned absolutely nothing in this class that I couldn't figure out on my own with common sense. The class was a waste of time  but it made for an easy A. And Grossman  although not helpful at all  is really nice. Get on his good side and he'll let you get away with anything. His project is extreamly easy and his tests are a breeze.
3,His powerpoints summarize what's in the book. Problem is  his voice is very low and I get bored easily. He's cool cause you can just surf the web. But you have to read the book to keep up  don't rely on his lectures they go all over. 6 simulations and a case project (mandatory for this class and section any way)  midterm and final.
4,very easy class project was a joke . u didn't need to buy the textbook test is straight from the powerpoint slide
2,terribly boring  just reads straight from papers  even when telling students not to do so. seems like an academic with no experience/ real knowledge. i've never had such an ignorant business professor  can speak condescendingly. seems like a moron  but thats just me
3.5,best class to take in the summer. he lets out class after a half hour or an hour. its pretty interesting. 2 test straight from power point notes  dont read the book just memorize all the slides. 1 group project  which is fairly easy. really nice guy. really good summer class!
3.5,prof. make class seem hard then it is to scare u. if u study the slides the nite before and spoke out during discussion u'll do fine. 2 tests and a group project which my group did the day before ... lecture is slow and dry but i got good news (no not Geico) u have a computer so surf the web all u want. but just check back in every once in a while
3.5,this class is a joke.he takes attendance every class but it does not count towards your grade. you can use the computers all class. just study the powerpoint slides before the test & you will be fine. one group project that isnt hard at all. i put minimal work into the project(92) & class and got a B. definately take this class.
2,teacher is sooooo odd. weirdest teacher ive ever had.. makes funny faces and reacts oddly to fire drills...kinda freaky actually. i would avoid.
3.5,very nice guy- tests are easy (minimal studying)
5,Just memorize the Powerpoint slides n briefly go over the book pages he assigns before the exams n this class is a sleepwalk.U can use his class time as a study session.U can use PC and he wont care.The project is not hard just annoying n make sure u hook up w/ smart people 2 do well on the sim game
4.5,Nice guy  a little weird  but not in a bad way. Not much work at all - two tests  one project  and the sim game. Curved the mid-term. Graded project a little harsh  but I guess we got what we deserved.
4,easy class nice guy. Study the powerpoint slides-memorize them! thats where his ?'s 4 tests will come from.class can be boring but u can use the computer throughout class & get other things done. No HW  just in class grp projects & 1 group presentatio
5,Class wasn't that boring. Study the powerpoint slides and show up to class and you'll do fine. Group project was easy.
5,Great professor  pay attention to power points and study off of them...listen during lecture and you will do fine..attendd class
4,This professor is great! His tests as long as you study are easy. Everything is in powerpoint presentations. If you have questions you can ask! Pay attention and you'll get an A!
1,i dont know what these other reviews are talking about! this guy SUCKS!!!! mid term  final and presentation. tests are SO hard trust me  im a smart guy. at least you can use the computer all class though
4,Good guy. Tests are easy  just study the powerpoint notes and you will do fine. Not as bad as these other reviews make him seem. Class is boring but  he does not care if you use the computer the whole class.
3,not a bad professor  takes attendance for every class  presentation  exams are easy (mc & short essays).
3,average...u can go online all class  mini presentation  tests mc plus 1 essay...not bad...gotta study on ur own tho because you learn nothing in class
1,She gave me depression.
4,I found this professor really inspiring. Poetry is a difficult subject and she handled it beautifully.
5,I absolutely loved her. Her lectures were interesting and I actually enjoyed going to class. The down side is that there are quite a lot of papers assigned throughout the semester  however she does a good job with feedback in order to improve your grade. I did find that she can be a tough grader but if you put in effort you'll do fine. I got an A
5,She is willing to work with you and helps you. The class is paper based and make sure to do them and use the criticism to improve your writing.
1,Awful professor
4,I really enjoyed her class! I undertood her teaching style  she was clear in her directoins and she helped me become a better writer overall. She does asign a lot of papers but she grades quite easy in my opinion. I would take her again.
2,She is not a good professor. Class would be so pointless showing up. Very late at submitting grades. She is SUPER NICE AND FUNNY and class is very CHILL but as a professor she is horrible. Her grading is not clear  she changes things last minute and before you know it  class is cancelled. Don't take her if you don't have to.
1,Worst professor ever! This class was 2 credits  but should've been 4. She gives too much homework & makes you do a group project where you interview other professors & students & she gives too many long papers for this one project  some papers not even related to our project. She is the only teacher that waits until the last day to submit grades.
1,She's very disorganized and unprepared. She never passes back your assignments to show you your grades and she doesn't post midterm grades so you basically need to guess how well you're doing the whole semester. She made everyone come to class the day before Thanksgiving break just to tell everyone 5 minutes into class that she will cancel it.
1,Absolutely horrible professor. Terrible temperament and very unclear about assignments. She makes everything as complicated as possible  seemingly in attempts to trip up students. Very unwilling to help students when confused  and simply has no consideration for anyone other than attractive male students in the class. Avoid her at ALL costs!!!!
3,Professor Sheryl Gifford is an average instructor. She provides you with positive feedback and truly does care about how you end the semester  yet she is not the most organized. She is constantly pushing back dates when she is supposed to hand back final drafts and does not post grades on blackboard  so you basically have to calculate your grade.
2.5,She's a very tough grader. She wants essays done very specifically to the style of her liking  and she's not very clear about exactly what she wants. She is somewhat helpful.
2.5,She has a very specific way she wants you to write your essays especially for Lit2010. I would not say she is very clear. Most of the time she confused me because she would condradict everything she said. This made it hard for me to write my essays.
4,Shes a very nice lady who likes to crack some semi-funny jokes. She is not a tough grader and is always willing to help  especially if you go to office hours. Class just consists of peer reviews which is fairly simple.
4,Take advantage of the peer reviews. She helps comes up with ideas for the topics. Papers are only 3 pages long but they make you think.
4.5,Absolutely love Dr. Gifford. She is such a nice and helpful professor. I had no problems with her and she explains papers so clearly. Her essays for 1101 only had to 3 pages long. She is there to help if needed. Attendance is a major part of your grade so GO TO CLASS.
5,Dr. Gifford is one of FAU's better teachers. She is very approachable and clear. There were no tests  only a group project which was not so bad. There are a couple of reader-response assignments and an 8 page paper at the end of the semester. It was a very interesting class and if you have to take it  you will not regret taking her class.
5,Class seems overwhelming but it's not only 4 papers if you take it in her 6 week summer class. I got a B+ and did everything the night before. She is super nice and sweet just me it look like you care and you will do amazing just but little effort in.
5,Please take her if you can. She made writing so much fun. She offered lots of helps on your papers.She wants everyone to succeed in her class. she often go above and beyond for her students. The best English teacher I had!
5,great professor helps with everything take her great with feed back amazing all around
4,In my opinion  this class was not difficult at all as long as you actually studied and prepared well for his iClicker quizzes. His test questions are very direct and fair. You don't need to buy his textbook  just his lecture book so that you can write notes in it. Yes he does have strict rules  but he's very funny and makes lectures entertaining.
4,His lectures will either bore you out of your mind or have you laughing every 5 minutes. He's quite entertaining and really funny during lectures  however very strict. He has a very strict policy about cell phones or any electronics for that matter  and I suggest not even thinking twice about using it during lectures.
2,Go to class  random quizzes for attendances. class is grades by points. No phones. Follow his rules and you will be fine. DONT buy the textbook. His notes are online. test are the notes. He uses clickers. He sends emails thing that you need to read (print them out/fill them out/take to class  they might be for extra credit)
3,I had Dr. Brooks for BSC 1010 and 1011. He is very knowledgeable in what he teaches. On the exams  his word choices are very tricky. So when you're studying for the exams  make sure you are very certain in what you're studying otherwise the wording could potentially trick you. He gives unannounced quizzes so study before each lecture.
2,Brooks is not a good professor. He lectures very heavy and if you don't pay attention you won't pass. Tends to make fun of students and can be funny at times but other times he takes his jokes too far to the point where he is very disrespectful. He will not change the way he teaches the course so don't bother taking him for biodiversity
5,Very funny during lectures  keeps you engaged for the most part and makes everything easy to understand. Took him for both Bio Principles and Bio DIversity  and glad I did. GO TO THE LECTURES! Everything he says during lecture is fair game for the exams  which are a bit difficult  but if you pay attention and do what he asks you'll have no problem.
4,Professor Brooks is a character. I had him for both Bio-principals and Biodiversity. Attend every lecture  read the lecture notebook before class and you'll do fine. His exams aren't too difficult  and in my opinion were pretty direct. His lectures are enjoyable but beware he's very strict: no phones  no laptops  no technology whatsoever.
4,If you don't want to study and I mean really study for the tests do not take him  you will NOT pass. He's funny and makes lectures atleast interesting but he is very strict and class is mandatory. (you'll want to go anyways  not a class you learn on your own) You will need iclicker for random quizes  that you'll need to prestudy for. Solid choice.
5,He's super intimidating at first and then you see he really tries to make the entire lecture time engaging. Don't be late  don't talk during his lecture  and TURN OFF ELECTRONICS (for real). Tests are fair  lots of pop quizzes so make sure you read topics ahead of time or you'll regret it  and he offers many extra credit opportunities.
4,Seems intimidating at first  but just jokes around a lot. He tries his best to make boring topics interesting so you don't fall asleep. Read ahead before class because he likes giving pop quizzes  and a lot of the time the same questions come back on exams.
2,A little rude but if you show up to class you'll be fine ohhhh just don't be late.
5,This legend was the highlight of my first semester. He's loud  funny  and likes to pick on his students out of mutual fun. He literally says what's going to be on the tests. This class was extremely easy  just occasionally review
5,One of the best professors I've ever had. His lectures are so entertaining that even when mind-numbingly topics like botany present themselves  he manages to grasp your attention. I recommend him to anyone that wants to have an incredibly clear understanding of biology  while laughing the entire time.
4,This is one of the best professors I have had at this school. His lectures are very straight forward and if you take good notes and study there is no reason you shouldn't pass. It is also an added bonus that he is extremely funny and really engages the class. His exams are fair and a lot of times he will hint at questions he will ask during lecture
4,Brooks has been my favorite professor at FAU so far. I am a Biology major so this class is important to me but he made the class enjoyable even though the tests were rough. Just need to study well and you'll do fine.
5,The GOAT
4,Personally loved this class  he's low key funny so it's not that boring. He tells you exactly whats on the test if you go to class. Don't buy or read the textbook buy his little brown book instead. Study his powerpoints and that book and the stuff he says in class and it's not that hard. If you don't pay attention in class might call you.
5,Dr. Brooks is an amazing teacher. I had him for Biodiversity and I learn so much and his lectures were never boring. He actually teaches  yet you have to put on your part to do well in class.
4,I took Brooks for BSC1010 as well  same textbook that I never opened. Read the ppts! take notes on what he lectures! Go to classes and study for iclicker quizzes  they are pop quizzes & not scheduled. Exams often have a few freebies but they are very long  study well!
3,Do not buy the workbook. This class is an easy A. Students who don't pass are the ones who study the night before. If you can't get an A in this course  you are not ready for upper level science courses. also DO NOT BE LATE. NOT EVEN A SECOND (LITERALLY).
4.5,dr. gamble does a good job of not working you too hard. i have her for an 8 am and she does her best trying to get everyone to work together. all in all she knows what she is doing and grades VERY VERY easy. all you have to do is rewrite something with her suggestions and she is more than willing to give you a better grade than before.
5,Great professor. Loved her so much I am taking her again for Lit 204. Easy grader  wonderful personality. Highly recommended.
5,I had Dr. Gamble for WRT 120 and absolutely loved her!!! So I took her again for WRT 200. She is the nicest woman and so intelligent too! She is a fairly decent grader  but you need to put effort into your papers. She is by far one of the best teachers here! You will love her!
5,Awesome woman..very easy-going..easy grader..good sense of humor..enjoys what she does..would definitely recommend her and take her again
5,She's a great teacher. She goes over the assignments you have to do  and they're not that hard to begin with. I'd recommend her to anyone.
4.5,GREAT prof. was an easy teacher  and had fun discussions. Papers were easy  and she is very fair with grading. Understanding  and helpful. Sometimes unclear with assignment due dates  so pay attention to those. I'd take her again in a heartbeat!
5,Very sweet lady. Material is so easy to get through and tests are cake. Aced all exams and papers. As long as you can write fairly well and do the readings  easy A
4,nice lady  easy papers  fair grader  makes writing fun. take the class  u wont regret.
5,shes awesome.. great teacher.. easy A..all you have to do is hand in a paper once in a while.. willing to help  easygoing
4,Easy. only read a few stories adn aced tests. as long as your not stupid should be albe to pass class w/ an A or B.
4,very very very nice lady. easy on the workload  and a fair grader. I would def. recommend.
4.5,Awesome and fair. If you don't get an A or B in her class something is WRONG with you.
5,Very clear with expectations. She is always willing to help. You can't lose in this class  she's the best!
5,very nice lady and easy grader!!!! class is a little boring but it's worth it b/c it's an easy A
5,very good prof...i enjoyed the class and did fairly well...just dont fall behind on the stories...her tests are fairly difficult
5,she is a very sweet and kind woman. You can tell that she loves her job  and she makes little jokes at times that are funny but not laugh out loud its 8:00 in the morning i have a hangover funny. But i loved the class and loved the teacher!!!!
5,She is a very easy teacher. If you need help she always has time avaliable to help you out. Word to the wise if you want an A in the class go to her before you hand in your paper and let her proof it. She is also very nice and kind.
4.5,You dont have to participate in class  she pretty much talks the entire time. Can be pretty boring. Her tests are harder then you would think based on her class. She also likes her opinions on papers and will lower your grade if she doesnt agree with your
5,She's a really nice lady  the stuff she assigns to read is not long and it's relatively entertaining if you're someone who does fairly well in reading. However  it may remind you of 10th grade english. A little too easy can mean boring.
5,I have taken three classes from professor Murphy-Lee at UW-Milwaukee and absolutely love her! As long as you attend class and do the readings this class will be easy peasy! She literally goes over word for word the answers you will need to write your papers and take your exams. She will help you endlessly so long as you ask. Definitely recommend!
5,She is at UWM. I have taken her 3 non language classes Attendance is important in her class  tho with a valid reason you can miss some  you will have an assinment every week  a quiz in some classes every week and papers and exams. Its not an easy A but if you do the work  participate  you should get an A. She's an awesome teacher
5,I took this class at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee with her. It's a class about vampires and it is really interesting  but don't take it if you just want an easy course that doesn't involve much. If you like to read and write  than it will be super easy. Be sure to show up to class  though.
1,This is one of the worst classes I took at the U of A. The teacher is really biased in teaching  she talks a lot about her opinion not anything interesting or useful. Try to get a better TRAD. You need to goto class  take notes everyday  3 writting 2-3 pages  and 3 test and a final. Test are 50% easy questions but the other 50% are hard.
5,I LOVED this class. No  it is not an A handed to you  yes  you do have to work  and wake up  its COLLEGE!r r Professor Murphy-Lee is always enthusiastic about her subject. Sometimes it gets boring  because the class moves too slowly for people who know history already.r r Easy if you do the work. Honors section easy as all get out! Do it for cr
1.5,HARD CLASS. Do NOT take. I heard it was easy but it most certainly was not.
2.5,The class was supposed to be easy  but she's definitely changed it. Everything is graded harshly for a TRAD  and she wastes a good half hr of students time at the beginning of class then makes you stay till the very end. The sad part is she is a really nice person and open to helping you  but her class is BORING and too hard for a gened
4,I thought this class was REALLY easy. Yes  the essays can be graded hard depending on your TA. She is too perky for me  but at least she knows what she's talking about. Just go to class and you'll do fine.
2.5,This class is aweful!! i was told it was so easy  but it definitey is not. You must earn your grades  and the essays are graded sooo hard! She knows what she is talking about  but she is so uninteresting. Russian empire/federation is boring and i hate coming to this class! attendance quizzes are frequent  and they suck! i hate this class!
5,She's a very friendly and helpful professor. Memorizing names and dates can be a bit boring and difficult  but besides that  the class is fun  interesting  and relatively easy. Honors section is enjoyable due to the relaxed discussions we have about assorted  student-picked topics pertaining to Russia.
4,This class rocks. I love TRAD's because of it. I could have got an A in this course when I was two. Great  friendly teacher.
5,I think shes very good  its just the class which causes problems. It helps when people print out the notes so they arent asking stupid questions. The honors section is really fun because we can talk about different topics from any time period in Russia that we pick.
5,"Professor Murphey-Lee is fantastic. She is so unbelievably caring and helpful. Willing to help you in any way as long as you ask. Even if history is not your ""thing "" she makes it really fascinating and has an infectious enthusiasm for the topic. This class was recommended to me by so many people who had taken it in the past.Take their advice."
5,Murphy-Lee is awesome. She's really easy but at the same time you definitely learn a lot. I would highly recommend her to anyone  she's awesome and her class is awesome.
3,Wow  this class is ridiculously easy. I feel like I'm in the fourth grade. I don't know whether that's a product of good teaching or what. She's a very nice person though  and the Honors section is a little more interesting and challenging.
3.5,easiest class i've ever been in
5,She was such a good teacher! SHe really wanted yo uto do well  and would help you wiht anything you had a question on. The tests were easy becasue she gave you every answer in the lectures.
1.5,No Comments
5,As long as you go to class  it's the easiest class you'll ever take. I didn't do a single assigned reading assignment- i'm sad I wasted my money buying the books. Pretty interesting too in my opinion.
5,Very nice person  and I learned so much! I thought this class was going to be boring  but it wasn't... it was very interesting to learn about Russia's history (and I usually hate history classes)... Easy A as well... HIGHLY recommend this class!
1,dont take this teacher if you have trouble with math. i had to spend a lot of extra time in the math lab because his lessons were so unclear. i ended up dropping the class and just taking an online course. would not recommend this professor to anyone. AVOID IF POSSIBLE!!
2,He's got a heavy accent that you can get used to if you try hard enough. He's very nice  but not very clear. i thought i was gonna fail the class but I ended up with a C. I wouldn't go out of my way to take this class but I also wouldn't be scared away from the bad reviews. Its very passable.
3.5,He is such a sweet guy! Every second week there is a test but it is open notes!
3,Seriously  anyone who complains is someone who just doesn't care. J. Tarski IS a little hard to understand  but you get passed it after 2w. He has such a big heart & tried his best to answer any questions to the best of his ability. He also encourages the Math Res. Center! Quiz/Test open note. Take him if you're serious about learning!
2.5,Very sweet old man  intelligent too  but is difficult to understand without following along in the book. Reasonable homework requirements and tests that relate directly to lessons and homework. You don't have to stay the entire class time  if you're willing to put in the effort to learn outside of class. open note tests!
4,Im not sure if he still teaches  but this guy is a incredibly smart! He is a bit hard to understand but if you ask questions you will understand. He is a very reasonable guy. I despited a test grade  and he was very nice and open minded about it  and ended up changing it. He'll stay after class to help you too. I wish he tough more classes!
1.5,He is a really great person. If you go to his class everyday he will help you more  but he is a little old so it's hard to understand.
4,Good teacher. Helpful  if you are here to learn about stats he can help you understand it by simplifying it. I get his class and it's easy to understand though I worry about his health. Don't listen to people's complain about him because they have no interest in math and does not know any bad teacher. I would recommend him to my friends
3.5,Mr. Tarski is old and hard to understand becuase of his accent but he is really nice! He comutes all the way from Berkely by bus and is willing to come in on extra days just to help his students. The quizes are open book and you are allowed to use hand written notes. If you come to class try and ask for help he will definatley give you the letter g
2.5,I'm not a math wiz  but Mr. T makes everything quite easy for his students. Come to class  take notes  take the quizzes (3 points each)  then take an almost identical test the next class after a nice review of the quiz. Notes are allowed for all quizzes :)Although he is sometimes hard to understand the textbook and his teaching method make it easy.
1.5,This guy's heart is in the right place for sure  but unfortunately he's very difficult to understand. He doesn't answer questions clearly and talks to the board. If you show an interest in his class  he will be very lenient with you in terms of grading etc. Take this class if you are already good at math  and you will get an A. Otherwise...bad.
2,One of the best teachers. I am a total retard when it comes to Math  but I got an A at the end.
1,If you have a hard time with math DO NOT take this class. He doesn't help clear up questions and will just move on to the next section. He doesn't explain what he is doing  he just works a problem on the board in small writing and then moves on. He's always late. Even on test days.
4.5,Easy class. Nice professor. I feel bad for him because everyone takes advantage and talked during his class  and those are the ones who fail  so that's their fault. He has office hours and can talk to you after class if you have trouble. I learned a lot - good class. :)
3.5,Though he is hard to understand sometimes  he really knows his stuff! If you do the homework and take notes in class  you will be able to overcome the confusion most students experience.
1,I signed up for this Professor's Statistics class in the summer. He was teaching methods were so unclear that I had to drop the class after two days. I do not recommend taking this class with this Professor. After all  you want to learn the subject  as it is a good tool for business.
4,I feel bad cuz everyone clowns on him and takes advantage of him. He is a good professor although the class is not very organized...the tests and quizzes are similar  and he gives the quiz 2 days before the exam.. hw optional.. take 'em  why not
5,I HATE statistics  it's like a foreign language!!! Only specialists use it. But TARSKI is clearly a statistical expert because he taught me stats and I actually understood a good amount of the topics. The course seems extremely hard but I pulled through with an A.
1,WORST TEACHER EVER! He not only has a thick accent but speaks to the board. He assigns a used car project and explains nothing about it. No help what so ever. DO NOT TAKE!
1,TAKE THIS CLASS!!! For the people that stated he's hard  he grades hard  you cant understand him  yaddy yadda yahhhhh... your the ones that either A) tried to learn in his class and get a passing grade  B) don't know anyone from his past classes  or C) both A and B r r For me I was neither. find someone from his past classes and use the tests they
1,are you kidding me  this guy is a prick. he busted me for plagiarism  after i asked him to look over my paper. his class is so boring and a lot of notes. this guys sucks  these people dont know what they are talking about.
4,dr. ovadia is one cool guy. the class is mainly a discussion forum as opposed to a lecture. just read 6 books and talk about them  as well as a short reaction paper after each book. you have to talk in class  though. he took everyone to starbucks on the first day and paid. awesome guy  definately take him.
4,The class is easy  but notes are very important. A chimp could get an A on his quizes  the papers do require some effort. He has a good sense of humor  but tends to distance himself from his students.
4.5,Class was interesting. Three quizzes and he gives you a study guide for each. The quizzes are taken DIRECTLY from the study guide. Take good notes and don't miss class and you'll get a good grade. Three papers-the final is one of the papers. Final paper was hard and made you think!! I suggest you start thinking of the paper early!!
4.5,Fantastic! This class teaches you a lot about the finer points in sociological theories. Take this calss only if you are interested in sociology theories. I would definitely recommend him over the other soci 381 professor. Tests are super easy. Papers a little trickier. Take lots of notes and don't miss class and you'll do great!
4.5,this class is hard. If I can get through it anyone can. He only takes attendance for the first two weeks. He is very helpful outside of the classroom though.
4.5,This could be my best college course experience. Dr. Ovadia is a great teacher  and wonderful outside of class as well. The class is challenging  but not at all impossible if you're willing to show up  pay attention  and study. Good balance of group/lecture  fair workload  and always willing to help.
4.5,Lectures explain reading well and you can choose topics for your papers (only 2). Don't expect to leave class early. Be prepared to take notes! overall not bad prof.
5,very nice professor. class is very easy. 2 easy papers  midterm and final. gives review sheet for midterm-what's on the review is what's on the midterm. Only one problem-way too many articles!! You definitely can't go wrong if you take him. He is definetly recommended! :)
5,Ovadia is a great professor and definately the one to take for theory. Obviously the class is really hard  but he does a great job of explaining all of the theories and theorists. There are a couple of papers  but they aren't too hard and he's not too hard of a grader. Great teacher!
5,I had him for 243 and didn't really like it but loved him for theory He explains everything so well very detailed and helpful. A lot of information to learn but he will help Be sure to have him look at your paper before you turn it in it will really help
5,He is an awesome teacher. He makes it easy to learn and tries to help you as much as possible. 2 tests + 2 papers. Def take him- he's really nice and cares a lot. I'm taking him again next semester.
3.5,"Relatively easy class. Never takes attendance. Don't have to do the readings if you go to the lectures. Explains concepts well. Not very insightful in answering questions though. Three papers and 2 exams. Easy ""A"" is you participate."
5,this is one of those classes i was afraid to take  but he made it so nice. he goes out of his way to explain things and engage class. Some of the material is boring  but overall I think it has been pretty interesting
4,Explains the rather difficult readings very well and is always open to student input. A couple of papers  quizzes  and an exam. Overall I enjoyed the class
4,Nice guy. Very excited about class but boring at times.
2.5,"This class was so boring!!! He has very distracting mannerisms...he will say ""ya know"" 25 times every 5 min."
4.5,2 papers  2 exams...pretty easy class and he's a nice guy and knows what he's talking about.
3,Sounds like it could be a good class until you get there. The way he teaches is terrible.
3.5,could be a very interesting class but its not at all. sooo boring. he stutters a lot and doesnt give good feedback to students comments and questions in class
2,He is very disrespectful towards students and will not answer questions. Also will reprimand students for taking bathroom breaks. Tests were easy  but the material was monotonous. One of the few classes where I did not learn anything new.
3,Class was ridiculously easy- an easy A if you care enough to do the work and pay some attention. Dr. Sirkin seems gruff  but is actually a very nice guy. He just expects students to act like adults and take their work seriously- makes sense to me! If you aren't mature enough to be responsible  you probably won't like his class  though.
3,Seriously  GO TO CLASS. If you don't your screwed. Do EXACTLY what he says and you will get an A. I have no idea how people can not get atleast a B. He practically gives you the answers.... Funny  enjoyable  dont care for people that dont come to class  gives attendence 2 times a class period.
2,Open book  open notes. But still not very east. He wrote the book so if you don't get it in class  and you ask and he just looks at you like you're dumb..you can't figure it out at home cause he WROte the book! Blackmailed into taking him..he tries...but not very good....with effort a B  i think the class is just so he can feel important
3.5,Tries a bit too much to be humorous  but he can be pleasant. He does not allow you to leave the class and stares if you come in just a minute late. Tests could be a bit more clear. Do not challenge him to be wrong because he gets very irate- one student took a test but Sirkin lost it. Despite the room supporting him he still kicked the student out.
2.5,This class is fairly easy. Make sure you come to every class and pay attention. His exams aren't that difficult  but he is fairly strict and won't tolerate messing around. He's also pretty funny.
1,If you are not good at math  and would require the help of a professor with a PLEASANT attidute  who gives a damn whether or not you understand the information  take anything but this class with this guy. Misery loves company.
4.5,Not a bad class if you have the right attitude. In fact  if you come to class and care about what you do  its pretty easy. Act like an adult and treat the professor with respect  and you'll find he's a very nice man. The text looked overwhelming  but it really isn't- just basic algebra.
1,He's not very helpful. I've had him twice  and both times he hasn't helped when I've asked. He thinks he knows everything  but he misses a lot. Doesn't really stick to the syllabus as far as a daily break down in what is going on in the class.
3.5,Open book  open note tests. Tells a lot of corny jokes but he's a good teacher. Make sure you don't drift off when he goes into one of his stories because he picks right back up into the lesson.
3.5,as a professor he does his bes  but the problem is that many liberal art students must take this course to fulfill research requirements but aren't interested in it. tests aren't bad. i like his jokes  feels like in good old commedy show.
1.5,Tests are open book so I mean that is helpful  but the material sucks and aside the fact he can't keep on the topic at hand for long or he does for TOO LONG. Sucks when he wrote the textbook so he thinks that he knows all.
3.5,Yes this guy is old & has bad jokes. But his test are open book  how bad can it be. Material is somewhat interesting. Just hang in there  he's not as bad as you think.
1,horrible teacher. Doesnt know how to grade and is very biased.
1,He doesnt teach the material and actually fell asleep during a student's presentation. Just like in grade school  he does not allow you to get up to go to the bathroom during class and wont let you tape record him....it wont take you long to figure out
4,Awesome professor  unique way to teach statistic principles. Tough teacher  but if you like a guy who doesnt put up with any crap..this is your guy!! Those who rated him poorly probably did so because they did poorly in class.
1.5,If you like to experience someone who is rude then this is the professor for you. Be very afraid to ask him a question. He doesn't like it. If you are going to be tardy  look out! He will stop class and embarrass you. And whatever you do  don't get c
1,He's very rude and only wants to talk about how smart he is. It's like being in higschool because you have to show up and he yells if you need to leave early and freaks out if you whisper or your cell phone goes off.
3.5,He is alright but he makes way to many stupid jokes. He should spend more time teaching.
2,He gets off on a tangent and wastes tons of class time  but takes attendence so you have to sit through listening to him tell about his brother-in-law buy a suit! I'M NOT JOKING!
1,If you like being indecisive  looked at with disdane  or feeling as if its the 1950 style of sitting in the back of the class then this is the route for you. This class will def. give you that push that you want!
5,Dr. Golden is a very nice person...but the class material was pretty boring. I never thought it would be possible to take attendance in LC-18  but ACOM 100 proved me wrong. This class made me loose interest in com major  but she gives lots of opportunities for bonus points and stuff. I got an A-....Study hard and it's OK  and always go to class!
3.5,This class was quite boring but easy if you use the lecture outlines on webct. Golden tends to ramble and get wordy in test questions but she is always willing to answer questions in class
4.5,this class is so boring and is the only time i've heard of attendance in a lecture center. if you have something to do in class it's not so bad. studyguides are posted online before tests  but some of the exam questions are unclear... discussion sections are pure torture.
4,Attendance is mandatory is this class. Prof Goldenxe2x80x99s lectures are pretty dry compared to that of professor Halkowski. Prof Golden is very approachable and would often show up early and wait outside the LC and talk with students outside of class.
4,Attendance is mandatory  even in a 500 person lecture hall. There are course assistants in every row to make sure you're there. Class is relatively boring with her  but it's worth it for the attendance  it can really bring your grade up. Bring lecture notes to class and discussion. It really makes everything much easier!
1.5,She was just really boring and did not keep my attention at all.
4.5,She will put the lecture outlines online and tell you to print them and bring them to class- DO IT! If you take notes on the outlines it is much easier to follow. The test questions are based a lot on the lecture objectives. If you read the objectives and can answer them- you will do really well. FOLLOW THIS ADVICE!
4,ehhh this class is arite...shes a pretty good teacher..trys to make the class somewhat amusing..shows some pretty good movie clips..tests arent that easy though so study
5,Prof. Golden was the most helpful teacher I have ever had. I missed some tests and she let me write papers to make up for it. Class is pretty easy  straight forward.
3,Lectures are boring as hell for many. Some find her tangents/examples helpful. First year they implemented Discussion Sections. They were much more helpful than Golden's lectures. All notes are on WebCT. They're a great help. She responds to WebCT questions quickly and clearly. Texts are a waste.
4,So what if the class is boring  but she makes up for it by providing a very detailed study guide and helpful notes. Attendance is a must and it can help/hurt your average. There is a discussion group with TA's every Friday and it helps you to have a better understanding of what you are learning.
4,if you read the lecture outlines you will be ok in the course  there are like 5 books  all pretty small  but it is very helpful to read them
2.5,No Comments
3,she reads right off the notes  no use going to class it is so boring. But 10% of your grade goes to attendance  so better bring a book or something
5,She is a tough teacher  you definitely have to work for your grade. She explains everything thoroughly and is looking out for her students' best interests
5,No Comments
4,Liz loves her students. The school would not be the same without her smile or her Beethoven head.
4.5,Liz is so sweet!
5,Very organized and always prepared for each lecture. Gives crystal clear explanations of slides and definitions during lectures. Tough but fair grader. The semester isn't even half over  and I consider him one of my favorite profs I've had. Take Breiner!!
5,Definitely not an easy A  but he is very interested in what he is teaching and is willing to help you no matter what. Such a genuine guy. I'd recommend him for sure.
5,AWESOME! this guy is a good teacher. explains everything clearly and hes VERY nice. tests are hard though so make sure u pay attention during class. take him  hes good
4,No Comments
5,Amazing professor and pretty demanding. Fair grader (although not easy). Made me want to continue on to grad school. Extremely helpful and really cares about what he's teaching.
5,SOOOO CUTE! I LOVED his classes  even tho they were early  i never missed a chance to hear him lecture. so smart and willing to help. definitely take as many classes as possible with him!
5,Smartest Professor in Architecture department  very humble not easy but take as many classes with him as possible
5,Very good prof....does not pick favs like all of the other profs @ this school....if you do your work well & on time.... have no worries..
5,an excellent teacher and intellegent man.
5,Great teacher  lays thing out very clearly. EXTREMELY fair grader - goes by the syllabus. If you suck  you'll get a sucky grade. Study lots and be timely about the case study.
5,he talks a lot and the tests are pretty hard  but he is great!
5,Best and smartest teacher ever!
5,Easiest History of Arch I  II professor. Very willing to help.
4.5,good professor  very helpful with students  grades fairly  tests hard but not if you study enough
5,Tough grader  but works with students. very good professor.
5,he is the best teacher ever! while his tests are hard  you learn a lot! he is very very helpful when it comes to your projects. he is just simply the best!
4.5,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS AT 8AM!!! Lights off  slideshow  just asking for naptime. Otherwise he is very organized and tries very hard to help his students. Very tough grader  though. Be sure to take very good notes.
4,His version of a grading curve-- he gave everyone one point. PRAISE THE LORD! Very helpful though  in terms of a human being  one of the most compasionate teachers I've had in a long time.
5,Great professor  very organized. The ultimate professional.
5,I took PSYCH 337 Comm. & Society w/ Prof. Milburn (online). The material he provides is very interesting and I really enjoyed the class. He is extremely responsive if you ask him anything which is great. The class is very straight-forward and what is expected of you is laid out clearly. The work load is fair  & if you do the work you will do well.
3,This class was online and it wasn't too bad. My only complaint is the final exam  it is ridiculous and unlike other papers I have had to write before  did not enjoy that at all.
3,He was very accessible  always gave feedback and answered very fast. I took this course online so I'm not sure how entertaining he is  but I did not have a problem with this course even though it was my first online course. You have to submit online discussions every single week  grading for all assignments is clear.
4.5,Easy A  the difficult part is willing yourself to go to class. Interesting topics but he makes it boring. The papers are challenging as it is impossible to write a perfect paper in 2 pages double spaced while cramming in 8+ studies. They need to be longer  which I cant believe I would want. I would not take him again as I found it hard not to skip.
2.5,He knows the material  but presents is in a dry manner. The book is interesting  but not necessary to get. Most readings are online. Attendance is taken  and could help boost grade. Papers are worth small percentages  tests worth more. Do the online practice tests (read correct answers) and you'll do well. TA is helpful.
3.5,I find this class to be a breeze. If you actually do the things he tells you to its an easy A or B. The multiple choice questions are literally word for word from practice tests and his papers are very short and clear cut. You follow the criteria and you get 100 like I managed to do. The lectures aren't very interesting though.
3.5,Professor Milburn's lectures can at times be dry (due to his sometimes monotone voice)  but if you are interested in psychology  there is no way to make this subject boring. His exams are easy  IF you do the online quizzes  which have all the answers in them. Most of the class got C's  but that' due to poor work ethic  he provides the way to an A!
1,This professor needs to retire now! I took his PSYCH 330 class and it was horrible! Boring lectures  confusing material  and not helpful! The tests are really hard! He gives you the Q&A ahead of time but expects you to memorize 250 multiple choice questions and only chooses 50 of them for the actual test! DONT TAKE !
1,WORST PROFESSOR EVER  hes def. on my worst professor list. This guy has so checked out of teaching its not even funny  hes close to retirement and it shows. He didnt even correct our papers he had his grad student do it so in reality we werent even writing for him because the grad student wasnt even correcting by his guidelines! He's so boring.
4,I took Social Psych from him. Professor Milburn is one of the best professors that UMB has. I wish that I'd have been able to take more of his classes and/or work with him more closely. Take a class of his efore he retires!
4,One of my favorite UMB professors. I wished he taught every psych course. He has one book that he uses which is his own book  and all of his other readings are online. You are required to attend classes  do the readings and do the mandatory posts for the readings every week  aside from that you do 1 paper  a midterm and a final.
2,He just doesn't know how to teach to a room of 100 kids. He relies completely on unclear  vague PowerPoints  and his lectures are totally centered around describing studies. It's very boring and misleadingly difficult. Also  the tests are built around memorization. This class discouraged me from pursuing a topic that I had been very interested in.
3.5,Good prof although when he talks about all the studies it can be a real snooze. The papers are short and easy. His exams r easy too if you take the practice exams.
4.5,He is an amazing teacher. There was no group work this semester  unlike some of the other comments indicated. There were 3 tests  all multiple choice and short answer. The questions were given to us prior to the tests  it made studying for the tests a piece of cake. I liked the class  He was able to keep a classroom of 90 under control vry well
2.5,He tries hard to explain study after study  but never quite puts everything into context. He is enthusiastic about Social Psychology on a personal level and that really shines through  but he is not a natural born teacher and that hurts his ability to pass on his enthusiasm effectively to the class. Always available for office hours. Very nice guy!
2,All powerpoints and lecturing. If you keep up with the reading it's not to bad. Has a few movies to watch through the semester. Tests kind of suck
5,He is a very good professor. All you need to do is do the assignments and make sure you turn it in on time. The exams were multiple choice and short essay. The essay questions are usually given out a week before the actual test. I think if you do all the work you should be fine. Excellent professor and very helpful.
5,He does expect you to work. If social psych is your thing he is your proff. Not for the feint of heart  know that if your a loafer you will be spoted. Take other psych classes if you want to coast. But if your intending to go into this feild he goes the extra mile for you.
4.5,I have had several courses with this professor and I think he is excellent. He is very demanding  has a lot of reading  but the tests are open book  so if you are paying attention in class and do your work  you will do very well. I like his lecturing style. He uses groups in his classes  but you can do the papers on your own if you want.
4,Mixed feelings on this professor. The work load was extremely difficult. I hated the group component of the course - it would have been very useful if our grade didn't depend on it. He's fair in his grading (aside from the group grade) and the subject matter is interesting. The lectures were a bit dry and he expects a great deal workwise.
5,Excellent poet and critic. Enjoyed his East coast insights. Is married to a fabulous graphic artist and is proud of his family's accomplishments. He makes his classes relative to what is happening in the world at large. Very erudite and knows his stuff. Loved his class.
2,I took online  pretty difficult. A lot of discussions and reading and writing. Barely passed.
5,Awesome professor! First class i took online and it was a great experience! We read 5 small books and they were easy to read and interesting. Take him! Highly recommend
3,Professor Schneider is very enthusiastic about the subject he teaches. You need to get the books and read because he does give quizzes. Attendance is mandatory. Good professor. As long as you study and participate  you should do well. Good Luck!
4,Don't miss his quiz's  but do not worry he warns you in advance. We had to buy 5 different novels  i suggest getting them early because many student had a hard time finding them...toward the end of the session. I got a B... his quiz's are easy... just read the books  his mid term and final consist of an essay and 5 questions.
5,I thought he was a great professor. We only had three paper assignments which were fairly easy as long as you did the required reading during the class. The papers were not long at all  and our final was really  really easy! I would definately take him again. Don't listen to these other ratings  he is a good professor.
1,I learned to hate the language I already know. He holds a chair in the dept.  he lets you know at the beginning of every lecture  however what chair exactly I do not know. Very  very unprofessional and pompous.
1,No Comments
5,I don't know how anyone could say anything negative about this prof. It's such an honor to have a nationally recognized poet heading up the UTPA English Dept.  yet he's very unassuming and easily approachable if a person needs help. I highly recommend him to anyone who's trying to learn to write poetry. He helped me enormously.
2,No Comments
5,Pretty good prof. Doesn't take attendance or anything. If you read the books the quizzes are super easy. The class discussions were very interesting. Coming from somebody who doesn't read or favor English too much I enjoyed the class a lot.
3,You do learn about poetry  if that's your thing. He has a minor speech defect that sometimes interferes with his lectures  which could turn you off to his seminars (It didn't bother me.) Talks a *lot* about his family in class.
4,Really nice guy  down to earth  Gives easy quizzes and intermedeiately easy tests which include half multiple choice and half essay. not too demanding considering he is an English teacher. Highly recommended.
5,Dr. A is an amazing director. He will push you and others in the choir harder than any other director. You will learn how to make near flawless music for the purpose of delivering beautiful texts and messages. A once in a lifetime opportunity to work with a musician of his calibre.
2,If you don't care about your voice and are okay with being exploited by your colleges PR department  then this choir is perfect for you! But really ... WAY overhyped. The straight-tone  blending  and the schedule are antithetical to a healthy singing technique.
1,Awful professor. Late more than not  doesn't actually teach  just tells stories about how great he is. Worst class I have taken at St. Olaf.
2,I will acknowledge that he's a fantastic conductor. However  he is lacking as a professor. Perpetually late  and mostly talks about himself  rather than the subject matter.
2,Dr. Armstrong is favorable to the students that are in the St. Olaf Choir. If you are not in choir  expect to get a lower grade. Plain and simple. Also  I don't feel that I learned as much as I could have because Dr. Armstrong was so busy telling the class anecdotes of how he's influenced people instead of actually teaching.
3,Amazing conductor! He truly loves what he does and is so inspiring to everyone in the choir. He truly cares about each and everyone of us.
5,Very thoughtful guy. He is not very approachable but he loves each an every one of his students. Some people connect with him better than others. I always believed that we were very similar so I think this kept us from getting to know each other better. An honest hard working man
4.5,Pulls it all together
5,He's unbelievable. So inspiring and heartfelt. His eyes just light up  and everyone sings their hearts out for him. An amazing experience.

5,simply the best
4.5,I am in Dr. A's Collegiate Chorale. It really does prepare its' singers for sophomore year and beyond
4.5,I had Dr. A for conducting  and he was very clear and a great prof  but definitely challenging.
5,I had Dr. A for Collegiate Chorale (a non-audition choir) and he was so kind and encouraging to us  and helped us feel great  and as a result  sing well too

5,I loved taking Professor Rising! the classroom environment is very easy going. her lectures are super easy to get through because she uses stories from her life to get through it as examples. really wish i needed other sign classes because i already miss her
5,I had her for ASL 1 and 2. I wish I could have her for my teacher for every class. She always gives good feedback. She also tells stories along with vocab to make it easy to learn. She also taught us how to still use signs even if we do not know the exact sign by description. Best teacher I have ever had from kindergarten to now. She really cares.
5,She uses real life situations to go along with lessons. There is homework every week  but like the rest of the class participation shows in your grade. Attendance is graded. Don't try to just write random stuff for homework or it will show in your test scores. I would recommend her. I will take her class every chance I get!
4.5,She is an amazing teacher who makes learning ASL very easy to do. She cares a lot about making her students understand. And excellent grades reflect on the way she teaches i would recommend this class to everyone!
5,Awesome teacher!!! She introduced me to sign lang and now I want to interpret 
4.5,I absolutely loved coming to this class!! Sherry is such an awesome teacher! =) She made learning ASL very easy. Her facial expressions were hilarious!!
5,I LOVED HER!! Not only does she make learning sign easy  but its sooooo much fun! She is so funny with her reactions and facial expressions  you are guarenteed a good laugh every class. She wants to help you in anyway possible. She is my favorite professor by far. Take her class  even if its just for fun. You will be so happy you did
4.5,Excellent teacher! Very helpful. Extremely nice and funny. Has the best facial expressions! I loved coming to class EVERY night and can't wait for next semester. I would highly recommend her to anyone interested in Sign. You will love her class!
5,he is a greeat teacher!! she bends over backward to help you. she is deaf so it encourages you to sign better even though she can lip read. wonderful class highly recomended
5,Sherry is an awesome professor!! She is really funny and helpful!
5,Very enthusiastic about teaching sign. She reallyl makes you want to do your best. She made the class very interesting and fun.
5,Sherry Rising is a very good Instructor. She makes learning fun.
4,She's a very nice person. She keeps you awake and helps you understand the content and she's pretty funny as well. Just do well on the exams  turn in all assignments and participate and you're golden.
5,Absolute sweetheart. Hard class but she is a SUPER easy grader. She is super caring and has a heart of gold. The BEST Spanish teacher I had in my three semesters of Spanish classes. I wish I would have known of her from the beginning. She is great. You wont be disappointed.
5,Yasmin is an ANGEL  hands down the best professor at Penn State. She's a delightful professor and really cares for her students. I went into this class terrified because i knew no Spanish whats so ever  she really helps you get through the class. She's helpful and humorous  her class isn't really boring at all. She's over all an outstanding person.
4.5,I thought Yasmin was a great prof. The first day she specifically tells you the class will be boring  but it wasn't. She makes it interesting and has a good sense of humor. There were 5 exams total with no final and some compositions but they were all pretty easy and straightforward. If you go to class and pay attention you should get an A.
4,She was a very nice person  but not a good teacher. Do all the homeworks  study for the written exams  go into the oral exams with a conversation in mind and just manhandle it so she doesn't ask you vocab. Annoying to attend because SOO boring.
5,Took the night class with Prof Yasmin. Really HATED Spanish and struggled with it  but had to take Spanish 3 to fulfill requirements. Take the night class with Yasmin. She's absolutely great. Free points for going to class. Grades compositions easy. Awesome.
5,Go to class! Great Teacher.
5,Yasmin rocks! Helpful  intelligent  understanding  and truly cares about your performance and you as a person.
5,Yasmin is pretty much the nicest woman EVER! She is a wonderful professor as well... If you ever need help or have an issue  she's beyond willing to help you. She's an understanding persona and you really learn a lot in her class. I highly  highly recommend her!
5,Yasmin is a wonderful professor and she is very down to Earth. She wants you to learn and is very understanding if you haven't had Spanish in awhile. Would recommend her for any class!
4.5,Great Professor. She is really helpful and knows how to teach Spanish real well. As long as you come to class and do the assignments you will do well. I highly recommend her.
5,Great teacher
5,I hate Spanish but Yasmin is great. I struggled in spanish 2 but am doing great with her. She actually cares about her students and will go out of her way to help you. Try to take her if you have the the chance.
5,I have yasmin for spanish 10 and again next semester for spanish 20 and she is the best teacher I have ever had. She is so helpful and even brings breakfast for us on fridays. She really cares about her students and I have learned so much spanish.
5,Yasmin (what you call her) is extremely kind and treats her students like a mother. She only takes attendence on random days. Homework is assigned but she never actually checks it. We take 2 tests and then the final which are all pretty easy. Great teacher!
4,very friendly..mother-like
3,good teacher. but teaches the class very hard
4,Yasmin is great. Very easy  and very easygoing.
5,yasmin is sooooo sweet. she actually cares to help AND a day i was sick  i asked a classmate to inform her i couldnt make it  and she actually took time out to email me to say she hopes i get better!! you couldn't ask for a nicer woman.
5,Adorable!
3.5,Tersh is very smart  very well-read  and very enthusiastic about his subjects. He just has trouble getting his thoughts out. Most of his classes are lectured with him pacing  head down  with his hands clasped. He's funny and sweet  but he can be difficult to figure out.
1,"DIDNT LEARN OR DO ANYTHING.....LIKED SAYING THE WORD ""UM"" TOO MUCH"
3,He is extremely boring. He also is not clear as to what constitutes an A. On the positive side  we got out early on every speech day.
2.5,He has got to be be the most boring person I have ever come in contact with. All we did in class was comment on what we read the night before. I got a B- on every assignment  and ended up with an A?
1,I got A's on everything in this class and still ended up with a B

5,Professor Top is amazing! She gives lectures that are super easy to understand and keeps your attention with fun stories and jokes. She is good about giving memory aids  which make information incredibly easy to memorize. Tests are incredibly easy if you takes notes in class. She covers a lot of info in each class  so don't miss if you can help it!
5,Carol Topping is one of the best professors that I have had. She is very interesting and knows what she is talking about. Just do the work and turn it in on time and you will pass.
5,She was so understanding! I tore my ACL and had to miss a ton of class  and I still made it out with an A+
5,LOVE her!!! Best teacher at Vol State by far.
5,I would retake this course a million times !! Tops explains everything very well and is always making us laugh. She is willing to work with you if your grade is struggling (which is unlikely) and is almost always available outside of the classroom.
5,Top is an amazing teacher. She tells hilarious personal stories to give you memory aids. Her tests are straight from the notes. She is very reasonable and I wish I could take her again
5,Topping is an amazing professor. She is full of hilarious stories and will make you laugh every class. She is super kind and easy to talk to. I am taking her courses again this fall.
5,Top is a great professor and is incredibly intelligent. Do not underestimate her. She is hilarious and class was always super enjoyable  I actually wanted to go even though I knew it wasn't necessarily mandatory. She's great  if you have the opportunity to take her  DO!
5,I love Professor Topping. Literally the best professor you could ever have. She has plenty of opportunities for you to make good grades and receive the grade you want. With her class you should pass with ease. I just love her y'all as you can see. I prefer you guys to take her class you won't regret it.
5,Awesomely easy to understand  she's good at making you understand. She says things to grab your attention. She's funny  and easy to work with! I would recommend her to anyone!! She my favorite so far..
5,One of the best professors at vol state. She is absolutely incredible and truly cares about each of her students. I was actually so sad on the last day of class because I loved her so much. I recommend this class to literally anyone. It will help you tremendously because she has a huge heart and loves her students.
5,Take this class!! Professor Top wants you to do well in her class and she makes it very easy to do so. She makes the material easy to understand and provides real life examples.
5,Prof. Topping is a great instructor who cares about her students and wants them to succeed. Show up  do the work  show interest in the subject  and you'll get an A no problem.
5,Topp truly cares about her students and definitely has a passion for what she teaches. I would recommend her class to everyone!
5,Top was absolutely amazing  I would take all of her classes if I had the time and money. She makes college fun and I love her to death.
5,Awesome professor! Really easy class just take notes and listen. Definitely would take her again if possible!
5,wonderful professor. Makes class interesting and fun.
5,"Professor Topping ""Top"" is so hilarious  kind  and knows her stuff. You wont find yourself with any questions that she cant answer about psychology! Her class will be entertaining and before you realize it  the semester has flown by and you have learned so much more than you probably expected."
5,Adult humor kind of teacher. Gave you many chances to get things right and turn them in. Easy A.
5,She's AWESOME! Sad day leaving her class for the last time. She's hilarious  keeps you interested  and really wants for every student to pass. There's no way anyone should fail her class.
1,DO NOT take this class if you don't want to waste your time. Spending 15 minutes out of a 50 minute class writing on the whiteboard  saying NOTHING while writing  is a waste of everyones time. Learning everything from SI and TA's just causes more trouble  he doesn't grade anything only the TA's do.
5,one of the nicest profs i have ever had. very approachable outside of class and will work with you to help get the grades you want. you definitely have to read so being lazy wont cut it. all grades are essays which isnt too bad because he gives the questions a week ahead of time and goes through them in class. lectures can be random but worth it.
3,His lectures can be boring at time  all he does is lecture the entire time and the tests are essays based on mostly the text  some on lecture. However he is SUPER approachable and willing to help as long as you ask. He has been the most helpful professor I've had so far  he wants all his students to succeed you just need to reach out to him.
2.5,Midterm and final make up almost all of your grade. Tests are essay questions he gives you the class before the test  he gives you 5 questions  but only two are on the test and you write about one. The questions are confusingly worded and have multiple separate parts. Personally do not recommend.
2.5,This class was the longest class of my life. Lectures are extremely long! He stands in front of a stand and reads the lectures to you the entire time. Go to the SI Sessions if they are available! I learned everything from the SI sessions. He gives 2 grades the entire semester :midterm and final both you must write during class like a test.
4,Teacher way heavy on the mid term and final exam. Both are strictly essay which was scary at first. But he is super fair and an easy learn just have to listen to a lot of lecture .
1.5,Nice guy  but long lectures. I had him for 3 hours once a week & most of the class was gone halfway through. Class is straight lecture with no powerpoint or visual aid  so easy to zone out. 2 essay tests worth half your grade  so outline and prepare well for those  & go to SI sessions! Extra credit is offered but ya gotta be there
1,Very droning  literally reading straight from a piece of paper  a lot of interesting things have happened in history and he touches on none of them.
4,two tests make your grade for the entire class - not bad but also not great. both are essay questions and its kinda hard to get at what he really wants on his tests.... otherwise attendance isnt manditory - however read the text! does give extra credit but gotta be there.
5,Professor Calderon is a great teacher. He really takes his time in explaining the material (Chicano History) and makes time to meet with you in case you got questions. I have taken several classes of his in the past  and I'm taking another one again. Great material and excellent professor.
1.5,Go to class and read the assigned material and you shouldn't have any problem with your grades in the class. Although he tends to go off into tangents about weird things sometimes so his lectures aren't always the most interesting.
1,No Comments
1.5,Rarely prepared for class  has an extreme bias  and his lectures are hell to muddle through. I'd suggest against his classes.
5,History of Chicano Education. Awesome info presented in class. He knows his stuff. Sometimes has students volunteer to present some info to break up monotony of his lecture--I think that's considerate. No multiple choice here. Had 2 essay exams and a few papers. Grading was fair (and generous). Nice guy. Respects students. Very approachable and helpful.
1,worst teacher ever  hates america for some reason
5,Dr. Calderon isn't the preaching Mexicanism  his students are. He is a great professor- his classes are based on open discussions of the readings. As long as you read the books  you are fine. I'm pretty **** and did NOT want to take this class but had no option and still made a B.
5,Great professor  unless your either lazy or a ****! Great texts  alot of chances to discuss. Lazy students stay away  you have to actually work instead of sleep in class. **** white students will object to a strong Mexican American telling it like it is. (i'm white but can't stomach ****s).
1,Should not be teaching! Very unorganized. Does the majority of teaching through the students giving presentations. Spends more time on soapbox blaming all of Mexico's problems on white North Americans.
1.5,Does not teach. If you are looking to learn something that you cannot already teach yourself do not take his class. He is not helpful. Should not be teaching.

5,Dr. Betts is a wonderful teacher. He is always willing to help if you need any clarification on anything. Really knows his stuff. He makes you work for your grade  but he's fair and clear on what he's looking for.
5,If you havent took SPH 131  this is the professor you need in your life! Professor Betts is super funny but very professional. He creates such a comforting environment in his class that makes it so much easier for speech days. He tells you want he expects & gives clear instructions for every speech  (4 +1 group speech) and also for the tests (2).
5,I was always so scared of public speaking  but Bob Betts creates a classroom environment that takes away that anxiety. He grades on content  not nervous ticks or memorization. Super enjoyable class with fun assignments. I would recommend to anyone taking a speech class.
5,Took this last year but he was a very nice professor. He was very helpful and if you do exactly as he instructed and follow his outline then youll be fine. I was very anxious to take a public speaking class but I left the class becoming more confident in public speaking. 10/10 would recommend. Research matters A LOT.
1,This professor made too many mistakes in his grading. He was also was very unprofessional about it because he did not care to fix the grades  unless you chased him down.
5,Best one I have ever had. Speech is hard. You have to practice  regardless of the professor. But if you do what he says  each speech you write he checks on each person individually in class. If you do exactly what he says when he gives you individual help  and you practice  you will pass easy. Hes really smart so just do what he says.
4,Nice  passionate  helpful... But tough grader FOR SURE
4,Professor Betts managed to make my first year of speech enjoyable rather than stressful and nerve-racking. He provided you with plenty of notice and instructions before each assigned speech. He also did not require anyone to memorize their speech
4,Research is key to good grade. Make sure to show up  be on time  and take notes as best you can. He loves class participation and questions and is very accessible via email and office hours. He didn't assign much in textbook  but if you take the time to read the related chapters  you will have a solid advantage.
4,Show up  do your research  and you'll do well
1,He is probably one of the most picky professors I have ever met. His grading is very inconsistent. For one speech  I used a visual aid in a way he liked. For the next speech  I did it in the same way and for some reason he did not like it and gave me a lower grade. Also  he'll tell you something is ok  but then later he'll he'll you it is not.
5,A very specific grader but a great teacher. If you're looking for a teacher that actually cares and makes class fun  take Professor Betts. Yes awesome!
1,By far the worst teacher I had at RVC. Very condescending and often spoke to the students as if they were ignorant fools. There are many different speech teachers you can take for a better experience. Please stay away. There is no need to comment on the professional style of this professor. In my experience there was none.
1,"He has set ideas politically and if your speech happens to conflict with his beliefs  your grade will reflect it. Even if your research is extensive  he'll discredit it because he doesn't agree with your point. I feel like people who side with him politically love him because he grades to encourage his beliefs... So much for ""open debate/dialogue."""
4.5,Great teacher  very enthusiastic  and genuinely cares about his students. Great guy. One of my favorite teachers I've had.
3.5,I enjoyed his class and sense of humor. 5 total speeches  4 indivual and 1 group. Mid term and final are tough.
5,great prof  hotness irrelevant- here to learn and get degree- got a b worked hard but found his influence next qtr when had to do a speech in a class- i was actually comfortable doing a speech finally thanks to Prof Betts! Well worth the time and made it FUN!! GREAT PROF!! kudos to betts for doing a GREAT job and being PATIENT and KIND- TOugh 
3.5,I consider myself a speaker with professional training through the military as a briefer and I received a very high B. Other students that I felt were weak received B's and A's. He seems to grade you off of your individual potential instead of grading you off of the other students. This will benefit a weak speaker and hurt a charismatic person.
4.5,As someone who is downright scared of public speaking  I found his class to be very welcoming and helpful. I learned tons of pointers and figured out how to make my speeches concise and effective. Professor Betts made my four week Summer speech course bearable by being a helpful  friendly guy. He is to-the-point but not harsh. Great guy.
4,Mr. Betts is really into helping students become all they are capable of. I'm a shy person and hate public speaking

5,The best class I've taken so far! GREAT person  great teacher.
4.5,Dumschat enters the classroom with energy  compassion and knowledge  showing interest in her topic and her students'. Directives are clear and expectations are explicit. Examples are often provided. She balances kindness and firmness effectively and utilizes a variety of teaching styles. If you want to improve...work with this teacher
4,she's awesome and explained theory pretty well  considering the whole class didn't get it.. i've had her for a bunch of classes and i dig her teaching style.
2.5,she's cool  but she tells a lot of stories about jane austen... and she hates margaret atwood  boo to that.

1,My experience with Immaculata has been unrewarding. First the mistreatment that I had with the Asst. Dean in Lifelong Lwarning. (Rude is an understatement). Then this teacher is insensitive and impatient. Give me a reak university. VU here I come.
1,completely insensitive...accused my friend of having a learning disability because she didn't do well on his test

5,Excellent Prof. Made uninteresting material quite interesting. VERY helpful  get her while she's still here.
5,She is super friendly and is very easy going with great lectures. She is very approachable for help and the class isn't too difficult as long as you follow her reviews for the exams. She is probably my favourite professor so far so I would definitely recommend taking this class! Overall a great class and prof!
4.5,Tanya is one of my favorite professors at the university. Her lectures are interesting  and she is always pleased to help students. Shes just a very sweet women and I would definitely recommend taking a class with her. Her classes are not the easiest but if you attend class and do most of the readings you'll do great.
4.5,summer session  If you go to class and do readings you will do well. She gave out 12 marks just for attendance. who can complain about that?
5,Very understanding professor. I missed her greatly during winter term. I hope she and her family are doing well. She helps students greatly  and she is very approachable during office hours.
5,She was VERY helpful and VERY concerned about her students  she was greatly missed in the winter semester and I truly hope to have her as a professor again in the future. I HIGHLY recommend her.
4.5,a great professor!
5,She is very nice with everybody. I like her  she is understendable.
2,"I think making us go to the cemetery and ""observe"" froze my ass off  not to mention creeped me out. I spent hours on her assignments when I could have taken a much easier course. She is approachable and nice  just thinks that her class is our on"
3,For a second year sociology course I thought she asked for quite a bit more than any other soc class I had taken. Because so many people complained  she made the final super easy  but her teaching style is often difficult to follow.
3,Very Brutal Expects too much!!!
4.5,Very nice prof  she is very reachable and helpful  very good class notes all online. Both courses were interesting. She is one of the hard working prof
3.5,Nice person...Soc. of everyday life was real confusing and most of the time I had no clue what she was talking about in class. Would like to have her again  she tried her best.
5,Wonderful prof who really cares about her students. Notices absences in dedicated students and genuinely wants to help  whether it's school related or not. Love her lots. Made my last year better.
5,Great teacher  very down to earth. GO TO CLASS!
5,I don't know what you are talking about. This is the first time she teaches here and  so far  she is going out of her way to help the students. She cares and she is awsome!
2,GOOD LUCK.... IT'S BRUTAL  YOU'LL THINK IT'S GOING OKAY BUT JUST WAIT UNTIL THE FINAL... EXPECTS TOO MUCH
4.5,Awesome course and an awesome teacher totally reccomend her to anyone in Sociology
4.5,Very clear lectures  she is amazing!!!!
4,Mrs. Martin is approachable and supportive if you are struggling or challenged by utilizing computer systems.
5,A useful course for those who are preparing to find a spot in the marketplace.Students learn to navigate through real world current & relevant scenarios.The course gets a boost with the inclusion of periodic lectures & talks with industry gurus.With so much happening in the cyberspace the course couldn't have been introduced at a better time
3.5,She is a very nice  easy teacher. She will help you and give you time to get projects done. However  there was no method to her madness as far as how projects were weighted. But didnt really natter because as long as you did it fairly well  you got an A.
5,Mrs. Martin was by far one of the most engaging  most dedicated  and most valuable teachers that I've ever had  and I have had some very incredible professors. Any student that goes through her classroom is the better for doing so.
5,very fun class. i definitely recommend it.
4.5,She works with anyone who needs help. Very friendly  corny jokes but has a sense of humor. Not too strict when it comes to grading  show effort and she will take notice of this. BTW: she is not hot.

5,She has a sense of humor and moves at a slow pace for the people who don't understand.

5,Professor Damen is one of the most enthusiastic professors you will have. You can tell he loves what he is lecturing about and it makes the class bearable. He is clear on what he expects papers to look like  and what the test material will be on. If you need to take a history credit take this one.
2,Professor Damen is a really kind and energetic professor  however his grading criteria is so hard to understand. He doesn't use canvas and your grade is basically unknown to you until a few weeks before the semester. Tests are all fill in the blank but good luck because they're hard. Lots of papers with VERY specific formatting and writing style.
5,Dr. Damen is amazingly helpful  and by far one of my favorite Professors. The content of the class was brutal  but he has a way of making it tolerable. He's incredibly motivating  and his comedy is stress relieving.
5,I absolutely love this man. His theater background makes his history lectures extremely entertaining and you will have several good laughs. He doesn't require you buy a textbook which is fantastic and you don't get points taken away you only add on. Only downside is he doesn't use canvas. Take this class! You will learn so much.
5,Professor Damen has a different way of grading- you earn points by doing assignments and taking tests rather than losing them if you get a bad grade. This makes it possible to get a good grade even if you don't do well on tests. He has a lot of guidelines for his papers. I really enjoyed his lectures. If you put forth the effort  you can get an A.
5,"Provides textbook for free online. A very easy ""A"" if you study for the tests and write the essays. Attendance is not necessary besides test and group work days because all the material and instructions you will ever need are online."
5,His lecture are really entertaining and it's obvious he is passionate. However  if you do the reading yourself class isn't necessary to go to. As long as you review all of the vocabulary words the assessments are extremely easy- just study. Highly recommend his class.
5,Latin classes here at Utah State are amazing. Professor Damen makes you feel like family. I can't imagine my college experience without his intellect and help. He truly cares about his students and wants them to succeed. If you ever get a chance take his classes. They might be difficult  but the knowledge you will gain is outstanding.
5,Super enthusiastic  loves the stuff he teaches. I would recommend buying the class reader book in the bookstore--take notes on it in class  use it to write papers  and study the bold terms for 30 minutes before the test and you will get an A in this class.
5,I loved him. He's super fun and helpful. I'd take any class he teaches. He's really fun to talk to  too. Just an all around amazing professor  my favorite one so far and I'm on my third year of college.
5,Damen was by far my favorite professor this semester! He is very enthusiastic about his subject matter  and SO funny. He makes learning history very interesting! He doesn't put grades on canvas  but if you do all writing assignments and pass all tests  you'll have an A. All test material is bold words on online textbook. Great teacher  great class!
5,Very Enthusiastic teacher. He will tell you exactly what he will be covering in each class in the syllabus. ALL test questions come straight from the online text book. Put bolds the important words. You don't ever need to go to the lectures if you read the text book. I never did  but got an A. The text book is also an audio book.
5,Great professor! Does everything possible to allow you to get an A! Really enthusiastic and loves teaching!
5,FREE online text. Professor Damen is amazing  the content wasn't my favorite  but he is very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about history. not unreasonable amount of papers. He wants everyone to succeed and will help you succeed. the tests are a little challenging  but studying is the key. useful audio and powerpoints. great class overall.
4.5,Damen is an excellent professor. Very excited about what he teaches. You will have to write several papers but they are short and he is an easy grader. He delves into lots of really interesting stuff in his lectures. Great class. I would recommend it to anyone
5,This class is fantastic!! By far one of my favorites. Professor Damen get really into his lectures  it GREAT  and he is always very helpful. If you study and do the work you will pass no sweat  only thing to watch out for are the essays. He is very picky about the essays andif you have to reprint it  it 25% off automatically. So BE CAREFUL.
4,He was definitely one of my favorite professors! He was funny and kept your attention all through the class. Although attendance is not mandatory  it is best to be there! He covers a lot of info. class that makes it easier when reading the book. It is a bit of challenge  but not too bad!
5,He is my favorite teacher by far. he is so enthusiastic about everything he teaches. this class is a wonderful history class  and if you want to learn about religion  or crazy roman fights  or scandelous stories then take this class from Mark! p.s. I seriously would of had to try to get a bad grade on the tests cause they were that easy.
4.5,he's very....colorful...rainbow colorful. He's got 6 rings on at all times  three on his left and three on his right. an earing. and he runs around like a chicken with its head cut off...but god is it a great class.
4.5,I think anyone taking one of Professor Damen's classes will either love him or hate him. He is extremely dynamic and passionate about what he teaches. As a theater person his lectures are like performances. He's anal about how his class is run. The best grading system I have ever had. Loved his class. Great teacher. Not an easy class but not bad.
3,Dr. Shingle is a very nice woman but not a good teacher  in my opinion. She is very intelligent so the way she explains the information can be extremely confusing. You can ask questions but her answer isn't always clear. I'm naturally a strong student so I did well  but people who aren't generally strong students struggled in the class.
4,She's okay. She tells you what's expected and that's it. She's smart and can come off as she's talking down to you. Online quizzes but two tests are taken in class.
1,Lady is impossible. Lectures are ALL over the place. She doesn't teach the material clearly AT ALL. In fact  the online quizzes look foreign since you learn nothing in her class. It's actually really annoying. If you email her to asked for clarity  be prepared for a 3 word answer and no explanation. You need to read the book  to understand.
4,She's okay. She rushes through the material kinda quick. I'm good at science  so i didn't have a tough time. But  you definitely have to read the chapter in order to do well on the quizzes. Which are online. So are the tests. No projects. Attending class in mandatory- you get points! She's a pretty great person!
4,Pretty much an easy A. All quizzes are online and test grades are projects.
5,Always go to class  the points can bring you down if you miss. The quizes can be hard  so read your book (don't bother trying to google  won't find many answers). She is very helpful so ask for help.
5,Great prof! She is funny and interesting. She makes the topics crystal clear. Before this class I was only taking biology because it was required  now I love it!
4,Dr.Shingle was a great person. Sometimes her lectures were really boring and I'm a science major but not that bad. She tells really good stories and is corny in a funny way! She is great to talk to and really smart.
4,she's a great teacher...she is so down to earth and knows what she is talkin about..she makes bio fun
4.5,Dr. Shingle is a great instructor! She's so down-to-earth and helpful. She was able to bring a topic foreign to most of us in the class to an understandable level. She's also a lot of fun. I highly recommend her.
5,she's awesome  knows how to invlove everyday topics into discussions. she's really into the subject and gets you to feel the same: )

1,He tells jokes yes  and tells stories not connected with an educational experience  and kaboom classtime is over with. I believe this is his goal (filler) to accomplish another class. Where is the meat? Where is an education dept. at Immac?
5,Great guy  fun class  lots of practical information
5,Very funny man. He offered alot of great tips on teaching. I would recommend him.

5,This professor was THE best instructor as a teacher and intellectual who I have encountered since beginning community college and receiving my M.A. degree.
5,I Love Dr. Downes. Very personable. Easy to understand.
5,No Comments
5,Best professor ever. She gets you to think on your own instead of just following what everybody else is doing. The classes are hard work but it pays off. She taught me a lot about myself along with the subject matter. I felt like she wasn't just an instructor  but a friend as well. She was very warm and open to her students and would help whenever it was needed.
4.5,No Comments
5,She helped me understand myself and society. I took her for 4 courses and loved every one of them. I couldn't stand to miss class because her lectures are so interesting. I love the way she has students discuss topics and reading assignments.
5,One of the best professors I've ever had in class. Challenging
1,I hated her. She tells you at the beginning of the semester that you dont need to take the final if you have an A (or a B - I dont remember) Well I had whatever she asked for & she made me take the final anyway. She gives feminists a bad name. JERK!
3,Extremely hard!! My first D!! A lot of reading and tests are a killer. We were expected to know things that we didn't really go in depth about during class time. Good luck if you take her..
5,I took her social problems class a couple about a year ago... awesome class. Very hard  lots and lots of reading (stacks of articles handed out each week). Well worth it. One of the best professors at HCC. Prepares you for the four year schools!!
4,great teacher  expect to read and discuss a lot  relate all aspects of the soc. problems on your papers and she'll love you.
3,Very hard teacher.
4.5,An intelligent professor with *high standards* who will offer help if you ask. I was frustrated by her class discussion approach at times  but I think it benefited more students  overall.
2.5,Feminist teacher  impossible tests  half the class failed...only D that I ever received (and I have a 3.7 GPA!!!!)
5,The best professor they have! She prepares you for academic success. Whatever she makes it is not enough!
5,This prof is great
5,Professor really knows the content. Is fun in class  but expects the highest academic standards.
5,--Gentlemen beware  she is out to get you-- Studied my butt off and got a low grade. By the way i'm in Honours. Absolutely the hardest class i've ever taken. I gotta admit  she was a great teacher.
4,I found her class challenging but very informative. you must use college study habits however to pass. tests are multiple choice and come from the book not lectures. she does enjoy women but likes men as well. its humorous. just pay attention and show
3,She is definitely a feminist but an all around nice woman.
5,Dr. Karpinski is by far one of the best professors at DePaul University. Every time I left his class  he helped me look at the world from a completely different perspective. He is extremely understanding and is always there to help out. Simply put  every professor should be like him. You will miss out if you don't take this class.
5,Best professor at DePaul. This professor really cares about his students. He gives a couple of essays for the quarter but makes it really easy to pass. Let's you redo any assignment until you receive full credit. I enjoyed every minute of this class and it was a night class. So happy I took him.
5,I would highly recommend for anyone to take him. Yes the class is easy and its hard to fail. His lectures were very interesting  especially for a religion class and he is very understanding.
5,Professor Karpinksi is AWESOME! Most amazing person i have ever met. There are two reflection papers one page each  and three 5 papers. He does an amazing job at explaining the material! He give you extra time to complete the papers. TAKE HIM! Best religion teacher EVER! Keep up the great work Professor! Chili pepper approved!
5,Professor K is an angel from above!! He is such an intelligent man. He does assign a lot of papers but it's worth it because you actually learn! The readings are interesting and so are his lectures. He engages everyone to participate and keeps an open mind during discussions. Keep up the great work! Here's your chili pepper  you deserve it :)
4,Overall interesting class. Take if you need to raise your GPA. Pay attention and turn in your assignments. Give effort in this class and you should get a A or B.
5,Karpinski is definitely a real gem. He gives you extra time to turn in papers. He is a fair grader. He has amazing lectures. He is more interested about you knowing the material than passing  so you most definitely will pass if you just show little effort in the class. I LOVE this man. I'm graduating if not  I'll take him again. ONE OF THE BEST!!!
3,I recommend that you read the course description because the title of the course is misleading. The books for the class are necessary. Every assignment is based on the readings. He can come off as a little rude to the skeptics. However he really tries hard to be respectful. Be prepared to hear rambling from the die hard Christians in the class.
5,Dr. Karpinski made it clear during his first interaction with the class that he was there for the students. Although it was an easy class  he made sure that the students got the most out of each and every class through participation  great reading material  and discussion.
5,Highly recommend taking his class at DePaul! Encourages participation and makes everyone feel included!
5,Dr. K was awesome! He always kept my interest and made a Thursday night class tolerable  which is really impressive.
5,Dr. K is AWESOME! He is the best teacher I've had at DePaul. He genuinely cares about his students' progress and encourages feedback about his teaching and assignments. He was a Catholic priest  but remains unbiased during class discussions. Participating is actually enjoyable and encouraged. Take this class!!
5,BEST PROFESSOR. He is an incredible individual and my favorite at DePaul! Take him!!
5,Dr. K is a great professor. If you have the opportunity you should take him. Keeps the class engaged and respects all of his students. He teaches you life lessons I don't think you'll find in any other class at DePaul.
5,Highly recommended to anyone! Dr. K is literally one of the coolest professors I have ever run into  mainly because he is just a wonderful human being. He is so intelligent and so compassionate and he understands the way that education should work. I wish I could have him for more classes. If you are a smart cookie you will take his class!
5,Great guy. Understands that we're college students  and knows it's just a requirement for most of us. I was born and raised a Catholic and learned more about the religion than I have my whole life. Didn't mind being in his class on a Thursday night
4.5,Dr. K's class was awesome! I learned a lot about Catholicism. He is a very down to earth guy that understands students. He shares some very interesting stories and real world examples during class.
5,Dr. K is undoubtedly one of the best prof at DePaul. His course was very exciting  I learned a lot of things about the Catholic religion. He explained well his lecture and give us all the info that we need. In short he is AWESOME ! Not to mention he is a very attractive and good looking man  one thing I regret was that I had him for only 5 weeks
5,Take his class(es) you wont regret it! If I had any problems it would be he graded the work really late but I ended up with an A! I probably learned more about religion in 10 weeks than in religious classes that are year long!
5,One of the best professors ever! I took the class over Summer and wished it was a 10 week class. He has a great presence about him that makes you want to pay attention and be present for every class. As for the workload  it's adequately planned for the length of class time. Three quizzes  response paper and group proj. Take his class!
4.5,Best teacher ever! So helpful and will work with you after class if you need it.
5,Great teacher! Take him if you can! Goes over homework  so you should make a 100% on every assignment. 4 exams  but they aren't too hard if you study. He reviews before every test. Gives you an opportunity for 10pts extra credit by turning in a project early.
5,Also took his 201 class. He's a fantastic teacher. He makes the class enjoyable. Goes over the review before every tests and shows you exactly how to do the problems on the test. There are 4 tests  each is 30 pts multiple choice and 70 pts problems. If you listen on review day  you should do fine. There is a reason his classes always fill up fast.
4,Mr. Trentham is one of the greatest teachers I've ever had. If you show effort  he will help you as much as possible. He is very laid back and as long as you try  it's an easy class. :) I'm making sure to sign up for his ACT 202 class  I can't imagine taking anyone else!
5,He is super helpful and super nice guy. I would refer him to anyone. He was an excellent teacher.
5,Mr. Trentam is one of the funnyest and easiest teachers i think i have ever had. He makes class fun and gives you all homework answers. He will help you with a test for sure. Just dont ever leave a blank on a test if you fill it in with just any thing like a smiley face he'll even count it. lol He's AWESOME
5,Great teacher  there is a reason all his classes fill up very quickly! Take him  you will regret it if you don't.
5,still the best. take him if you must take accounting  i urge you.
5,I would certainly recomend him. He is very laid back and  although the class isnt easy  he makes it as painless as possible.
5,Mr. Trentham is the best teacher that I have ever had. He really wants his students to succeed and he does everything he can to help you. I do not usually rate my professors on this website  but I really wanted to give him a good evaluation.
4,Great teacher
4.5,pretty sure hes the coolest teacher at vol state. hes so hilarious and makes learning funnnnnnn. hes so goofy and has a good time at his job. if you HAVE to take accounting then you should DEFINITELY take him!!!
4.5,if you have to take accounting  do yourself a favor and take trentham! very funny guy  good and EASY. his tests are kinda hard but he tells you exactly whats going to be on it. if you put any effort into the class you wont get worse then a B. classes consist of going over chapter notes and then giving answers to the homework. prac. set was required
5,GREAT
5,Brent I would have to say is one of my favorites...he explains everything as if you are on the brink of grasping it and his teaching takes you over the edge...he is hilarious...great guy...great class if you have to have it....
5,super nice guy. really explains the matterial well. I just couldn't wrap my head around it.
5,Brent is a fun teacher. I hated the subject but his teaching is great.
5,makes class fun!!!!!!
5,trentham made this class very easy and understandable......he has great stories to tell too.......
5,excellent teacher. she knows what she is talking about and she doesn't make anyone feel dumb when they ask stupid questions.
2.5,No Comments
1,I hate this class with a passion save yourself don't take it!
1,"She seemed to know what she was talking about  just not how to explain it. With my class  she was pretty rude to more than one person  and in front of the class. One classmate left the class because Mrs. Hester told her there was ""NO REASON"" for homework not to be done and Mrs. Hester proceeded to say ""does anyone else want to leave class?"" It may just be me though everyone else seems to have a good opinion over her."
5,if you want to learn about accounting then this is the professor to learn from..She is fair minded  keeps you moving along  and makes sure to stop when explanations are not clear...ask and she helps...great class
5,Mrs. Hester is an excellent professor. She is always willing to help and does a good job shining the light on a difficult subject.
5,video course  but was helpful and nice. Tests were not easy  but either is accounting
5,Mrs. Hester is a superb teacher. Not only is she knowledgeable in the subject area  but she is also able to teach it to others - not a talent all accounting teacher possess! Would highly recommend to anyone who is serious about learning.
4.5,Wonderful...really captivating and interesting  and hot!
2,Bon prof  mais ne prend pas en consideration que nous ne sommes pas tous des philosophes.
5,Bon professeur  tres interessant.
5,No Comments
5,Respectful towards students. Has plenty of patience and takes his time to answer any questions. Grades consistently and fairly. And is overall very friendly person. One of the best professors I have come across.
5,"It's a hard course  but you need to be focused on whatever he give to get an ""A"" grade. He is very helpful and will answer or clarify any question you may have. I really enjoyed this class and learned a lot . read read read your TEXTBOOK to understand  and if you don't you will regret that and everything will be very hard to understand."
4.5,Awesome teacher! Really easy going and really tries to help you understand the material. I had him for Acct 1 and I am taking him again for Acct2.
4.5,Best professor ever! It's a hard course but if you take advantage that he is there to help  you will succeed. He will answer or clarify any concerns you may have. Not only I enjoyed this class but I learned a lot. Huge tip - read your texbook  if you don't you will be lost and it will be much harder to understand his lectures.
4.5,great guy that understands what it is like to work and go to school. he is always available and puts out extra helping instruction. just listen and follow close because sometimes he switches gears and may loose you if your not on the ball.
4,Very nice guy. Take this class you wont regret it.Be there for the test review and your good.
4,He is a wonderful  very fair  go the extra mile to help you get to where he knows you need to be in understanding the work. I am so glad that I had him and I wish he could have taught Acctng II. I recommend him to anyone who has been out of school for awhile or was never required to have acctng in high school. Thanks again professor
4.5,He is very helpful and as long as you show you are trying  doing homework  taking notes  etc. you will pass. His tests are thorough but his grading methods are fair.
4.5,Awesome guy. It's been 6 years since I had Act 201 and thanks to him I finally passed. Extremely helpful and does everything he can to help you out. I spent the semester pregnant and missed a few classes and make-ups were very fair. Test are 1/2 close 1/2 open w/hardest parts open book. Definitely take him over others.

3,Raymond is awesome. He's sweet and is very experienced in the fashion industry. He has lots of great stories to tell from his previous career experiences. He's pretty lenient during class but you wouldn't want to miss his class because he is so funny
4,LOVED HIM!! He is a great teacher and is more interested in the design elements and creativity of the projects than construction. Really wants you to succeed and push your creativeness. Can't explain enough how much I loved him and his class.
5,Ercoli is the BEST! He's so laid back  and free spirited. He really gives you the room to be creative  instead of always trying to change your ideas like other teachers. He has lots of cool books  and can tell you about really cool relevant things...just ask him. Def. take him for Prob. Solving. NOT CLARA
4,Caliente!!! Need I say anymore
5,No Comments
5,Raymond is such a great guy. He really knows the industry and tells great stories. He really gets to know his students.
4,Raymond is the best. He is a great person to get to know. Some of the other teachers may help you to grow as a desginer more but with Raymond you truely get a friend.
1,She was hard to understand. If you asked a question she wouldnt answer it. I almost failed her class because i was so unsure of what to do. I learned everything on my own and then in act 202 with hoover. I am sure she is a great accountant but not a good teacher at all. And not being clear is not teaching at college level its not teaching at all
5,I enjoyed Ms. Estes  she was insightful. However  if you are immature and want your work hand feed to you then you might not take this class and go back to high school. She teaches her class on a college level not high school. You act like an adult you are treated like an adult. You act like a child you will be treated as a child!!
5,I took the online ACT 201 class with Ms Estes. She was very quick to respond to any questions I had via email  and was very fair with grading.
1,If you want to learn how to do accounting  don't take her! If you ask her a question  she will answer with another question and you end up more confused than what you wereorginally.
2,Mrs. Estes was not a good teacher. She was hard to understand and would go on about things that aren't important. Then she skims over the things that are very difficult. She's not very helpful when you're struggling with something. She teaches the class as though everyone already knows the material. She doesn't seem to understand that everyone is

3.5,Class hard to sit through. Very boring. She answers her own questions and just goes through the problems in the book.
3,Overall a good teacher. She is pretty boring though  although she throws out a joke every now and again. Her grading is fair and the tests are too bad.
5,Very helpful. Easily understood. Good grading scale

4.5,Odette was very helpful. I learned a lot about myself and my personal teaching styles. Her assignments are helpful for the future. As a student who was not in her advisory she directed me towards better courses which I provided for my actual advisor. Odette you ROCK!
5,Odette is one of the most amazing professors I've ever had  I absolutely love her. She is so helpful  and everything she teaches is stuff that can be applied to the real world. She is without a doubt one of my favorite people.
5,She is my favorite ed prof... she is super helpful and a great teacher
5,awesome! super helpful  fun class!
5,Everything she says about teaching is right on. I can sometimes hear her pearls of wisdom as I'm teaching.
5,Odette is amazing. She has a lot to bring to the field and makes the information fun to learn along with making the information understandable.
5,Super wonderful! She has a lot of insight and is always willing to push you. Even after graduation she pushes you. Fantastic.
1,She ****ing blew as an adviser
1,Contrary to popular belief  Odette does NOT rock.
5,Very giving of her time and knowledge. She tries to bring the best out of each student.
5,YOU ROCK!!!
4.5,You rock Odette!! :)
5,Odette! My goodness are you HOTT!
5,fun! good teacher to work with...always has good input
5,Classes are similar  but you learn a lot. Has a lot to bring to the table and very easy to talk to.
3,His class isn't hard  just really easy to get bored. As long as you know your terms and definitions you'll be fine. He doesn't like making things too difficult so the bare minimum is how his classes are set up.
2.5,This class is just hard  period. Physics is not my forte'. Mr. Dipert can come off as condescending and confusing but I've found if you approach him outside of class he is a different person. He tells you what to expect on quizzes and exams and leaves plenty of room to ask for help. If you do well on final and project  you'll pass.
1.5,"Never EVER have I met a more CONDESCENDING and RUDE teacher in my life. If you don't have thick skin  you can pretty much expect to leave in tears after every class. Claims he wants you to succeed but then tells students they won't make a good ""such and such"" if they can't do this/can't do that. Word cannot describe how AWFUL he talks to students."
5,This class was way easier than I thought  he lays out clear guidelines for what you need to do to pass  and let's you decide how you will do. Every week he has a quiz  which you must be present for to be able to get your points (that build up to an A)  but as long as your getting a decent grade  you can leave early. He is very willing to help.
4,Great professor! Really enjoyed his class. Study your terms in book  take the quiz each week and you'll be fine. Doesn't take attendance  but must take the quizzes. Get out early a lot after about the first 3 weeks of class. Has a good sense of humor. Definitely recommend his class for anyone. Didn't know anything when I started and got an A.
5,Very easy class. Go and take the quiz each week and then you can leave if you want. I made over 100 on almost ever quiz. You must buy the book for this course  then just study the words for every chapter. The quizzes are not that difficult and if you stay for the whole class you get out atleast an hour or hour and a half early for night classes
3.5,He is a good professor. Easy to get along with and he doesn't care if you stay for the whole class as long as you take the test at the beginning!
3,AT first I thought he was a little nuts. First day of class he told us all he had alzheimers. He turned out to be a really cool guy though. You don't have to sit thru class just go in and take your test every class. Easy A! And an interesting class. Recommended....

5,I loved taking ACCT 1010 and 1020 with Prof Janicek!!! He really does care about his students and wants to see them do well. He doesn't use HW as a grade  nor does he grade it but goes over it in class. He took 3 grades for each of the classes
1,AVOID. I was so excited to take a feminism class  she absolutely ruined it for me. Kept calling cisgender women 'born women' and brushed me off when I brought it up. Class discussion felt forced and inorganic  readings were excessive and unnecessary. Mandatory participation is a major drawback since she absolutely doesn't care what you have to say.
1,Ask a question and she'll spend five minutes giving you a non-answer. Definitely got a second-waver feminism vibe from her.
2,average teacher. would not take again  fair grader.
3.5,chantal is very clear about exactly what she wants and is willing to answer any questions. it's easy to get ahold of her and her TA. her lectures are pretty much a summarysynthesis of the readings  so it's easy to get away with not doing a deep reading ahead of time. there is no textbook  she makes the readings available for free.
1,So disappointing. I honestly feel like any of the girls in our class could do a better job of TEACHING this course than her. Regurgitates the readings during class without interpreting them or trying to engage the students in discussions. When she does ask us questions  she barely understands our responses most of the time. Avoid her!
2,Seems to have little respect for her students. She does not seem to enjoy teaching at all. Avoid.
1.5,TERRIBLE! I was overjoyed to get a B since I could barely stay awake the whole semester. Class consisted of 28-slide power points since the professor liked hearing herself talk. No class discussion. No encouragement. Strict with attendance and lateness. Not at all helpful for the final paper. Keri  the class writing tutor  is awful too. Just AVOID!
5,Great prof. Brillant thinker. Very dry sense of humour. Great readings. This class turned out to be a lot more interesting and fun than I originally anticipated.
1,The class has no use at all... powerpoints useless  when you ask questions she skips over them not answering them. She doesn't know how to use a computer. she couldn't figure out how to log on to the computer one class so we didn't do anything. every class she repeats herself on what she said in the first class of the semester. Overall very boring!
1.5,extremly uptight  video boring powerpoints useless  frustrated when u ask something  one small assaigment  exam question given one week previously  and a final paper.
4,She is intelligent and kind. However  the constant powerpoints of the readings got dull. When she didn't rely on them to lecture it was great. She will show you a lot of perspectives and the class is overall incredibly interesting.
4.5,This class was great. The readings were interesting  she encouraged class discussion. She did not seem closed to activism  and encouraged people to speak their minds on a variety of issues from many perspectives. She is a bit old school  but knows a lot and was pretty engaged in the subject material as this is a class she developed.
2.5,Readings were decent  but the prof was terrible. Disdainful of student activism  completely closed to student input  gets really defensive and unpleasant if you raise critiques  especially closed to post-structuralist and deconstructionist approaches. She shows upsetting material depicting graphic violence against women in her classes without warni
1.5,if it wasn't for the fact that she took attendance i might not have made it - considering it should be an intro class in a subject i normally love. her lectures are the readings and as for grades  she gives you what you probably deserve minus one letter point. when discussion happens  she doesn't lead and it quickly becomes repetitive.
2,boring  uninspiring  uptight and snappy
2.5,All she did in the lectures was summarize the week's readings. If you did the readings  the lectures are extremely boring and useless. Chantal does not encourage class discussions or participation. We also watched quite a few movies. She's a nice person but a lazy professor.
3.5,nice teacher  very professional. Does require lots of reading and class attendance is mandatory. Fair marker.
5,Concordia needs more profesors like Dr. Maille.
3,Just never mention the 2nd wave  she gets mad if you critisize it and takes it very personally. Also  it's impossible to get an A+ in her class - which is BS. If you desserve the grade - then you should get it. She rants sometimes  and she sometimes does not take critiques. . . .
4,I agree that she is gentle and kind  and she is also professional. The work isn't too hard and the lectures & class discussion cover the readings in case you didn't do them. Lots of videos and discussion which is a nice break from taking notes on your knees since the sh*tty SdBI only has couches  not desks.
1.5,Mr. Jackson was not helpful at all and was very unnecessarily demanding.
1,He is a terrible teacher  and if you want to pass DO NOT take him  he could care less whether you pass or not. He is not doing this job because he enjoys to teach thats for sure. DO NOT take him.
1,This guy has no clue what he's talking about. He was out for a week and he came back  gave us our test and expected us to know what neither he or the sub went over. Do no take..
5,Very thorough  tests go over what we learn in class and she doesn't purposefully make them difficult. I feel like she cares about us passing and wants us to succeed. We have a few take home tests  which help to raise our grade  gives extra credit  and let's us drop our lowest grade  meaning we can skip the final if we're doing good enough.
3.5,She is very straight and to the point. It is helpful to highlight in the book during lecture  most of what she says and puts on the test comes straight from the it. Highlighting makes it a lot easier to study for her tests  use that as your study guide. She does not take attendance  but her lectures are definetly helpful for the tests.
1.5,if you make a low test score she will make an appointment to speak with you BUT WILL ONLY go over with what you missed she will not offer NO EXTRA work work and if you happen to ask again she will say AT THIS POINT there is nothing she can do like how messed up is that never will recommend her
5,She tests more on the A&P than the word definitions  but she goes over everything and is pretty fair. She uses a high school grading system (93-100 A  85-92 B  etc) and that sucks. Would have gotten an A if she used a regular grading system  but overall good teacher who will work with you if you have to miss a test or something.
5,Professor Allen made it extremely easy to break down medical terms. You always know what's expected on the tests and if you have questions  she is always available.
4,Mrs. Allen is not the best teacher I've ever had. She has no personality making it very hard to connect with her  and she is very monotone. She does give you the terms needed to study for the test but it's just not terms. There are all kinds of required things to learn for the tests like: A&P  procedures  terms  different diseases  etc.
4.5,She drops the lowest test grade & the final is the same weight as any other test. Don't miss a test day b/c she does not allow make ups. She has no personality but thats b/c she has SO MUCH info to cover. If you study even a little you should pass this class. Tests are straight from the book
5,She is awesome. Her teaching style is fluid and to the point.This is one class you do not want to take online you will miss out. The best professor I have ever had. The best word to describe her is wonderful.
5,She is awesome and she tells you what to study for the test. No tricks. She give extra credit on the last 4 tests and one of the last tests is a take home test. I really enjoyed this class. I made a A
5,Cool teacher. Whatever you do  don't take this class online!!!! It's impossible to pass. You also have to make a 93 in this class to in order to get an 'A'
5,DON'T take this class ONLINE!Take her lecture class.r The Goods: She tells you exactly what to study for and what definitions to know. She is also very helpful in explaining things.r The Bad: There really isn't any. Just know the words she gives you and you will pass.
5,She was pretty cool and told you exactly what was on the tests. You ahve to study non-stop though.
5,If you can memorize at least 40 words a week  you will do fine in her class. If you can't- GOOD LUCK in passing!!!!
5,She is very helpful and as long as you study everything medical you will do fine!!

4,EMT-B professor at VSCC
4.5,"Hunter Henson is seriously one of the most intelligent professors I've ever had  and even ever known as a person ... it took some time to figure this out because he is super super humble... he is about 43-45 yrs but has been teaching EMS for 15 yrs? He is a TRULY GOOD PERSON  has strong moral compass  is an RN in ""spare"" time  don't expect breaks."
5,Best teacher ever
5,What a guy. Abbas is a German genius mathematician with a slick accent. He's always cracking little jokes  bringing a little light to a very dull and stale topic. The class is stone cold. But that's not gonna change with a different prof. Plus lectures aren't mandatory because he posts his notes online. Go to recitation for the quizzes.
4,I love Abbas with all my heart! Having him as a prof is like having a genius grandpa teach you math
3.5,Loved the guy. Interesting despite the topic and always cracks jokes. Easy grader and throws a huge curve at the end of the semester.
4.5,It's not an easy class  but he definitely helps. The homework problems are very similar to those on the quizzes and tests.
5,I love this guy  really cool!
3.5,Funny guy  really smart. If you're naturally good at math this class won't be too bad. I would avoid skipping as he covers about a section a lecture. Homework is tough  but the quizzes and exams are quite easy.
4.5,Sharp guy  expects a lot from his students--sometimes I think he confuses us with his grad students. He doesn't always work out solutions to the homework problems before he assigns them  which can turn into long and grueling homework sessions. Homework took roughly ten hours a week  often more. However  it was definitely worth being in his class.
3.5,Homework due twice a week- very hard. Tests (2 exams and a final) were easier than the homework. Quizzes once a week. Difficult class  but some interesting proofs. Funny guy
1,This professor was terrible.
4.5,The class was hard  but not beyond what someone in an Honors math class should be able to manage. He gave up his own time for a problem session  and was helpful with office hours. Highly recommended
3,Very very difficult  even for an honors course. Not impossible though: a good challenge for someone looking to do well in a math career. He explains well  but the material can be so murky that it is still takes time to sift through. Gave up his own time to give us an unofficial recitation session: I highly recommend him.
4.5,Great teacher  commited to helping students understand Calculus and do well in the class.
2.5,excellent communications ability
5,hes hilarious  i liked the lectures
4,He's a really good professor and does a lot of examples to help you understand. I would definitely recommend him.
5,Abbas is the****.
5,I like him because I understand him when he teaches me in class.
4.5,Abbas is hilarious!!!
3,He's not a great prof  but he's a damn genius and he's really funny.
2,I wouldnt take a class by him again unless it was free. He just wasnt a good teacher. Acted bothered if you tried to contact him. I did take the class online so maybe it was that. But the class wasnt too hard just a lot of memorizing medical terms.
5,Taking online class. Good teacher  nice and helpful. Organized and clear. Study the vocabulary and you're golden.
5,I took this class on line this summer. Dr. Coleman was extreemly helpful and quick with getting back to me with any questions. I struggled a bit at the beginning but he kept with me and was encouraging through the course. I wound up getting an A. I would highly recommend him.
5,I took Prof Coleman's web class. We had 4 multiple choice tests over terms  a homework case study test  and a final case study test(this one was a bit difficult). If you do what is expected of you  this can be a very easy class. There is a list of terms that is given at the beginning of the semester. Memorize these and you'll make an A.
4.5,I took the class AHC 115-V31 Med Term  college @ home course. Test are super easy.. only 4 all together. 3  are 75 multiple choice and 1  is 50 MC Q's. Just study and make note cards. I had no medical background what so ever and passed with a 94!! Extra credit is offered :)
5,all tho i didnt get him for a lecture class  he is a great support for the college at home course. willing to help  and very understanding!!! he is a wise man  with compassion to seeing you succeed...
5,HE IS GREAT. I HAVE HIM FOR MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE HIS CLASS AND HIS WAYS OF GRADING OUR TESTS. IF I COULD I WOULD TAKE HIM AGAIN.
5,his class was majorly easy! He gives notes for each chapter section  and test reviews. However  his lab makes you sweat a bit... but when it's fun  it's great.
5,He is Gneiss as schist. We love you Mr. Coleman!! You know who this is from!
4,I loved Mr. Coleman. His class is hard  but his grading is very fair. I disagree with the previous comment. He DOES teach on a students level  it's just a college student's level  not a 5th grade one.
1,Mr. Coleman has a wonderful personality  and if I were a paleontologist listining to his sermons  I would probably understand his class. He doesn't teach on a student's level. He should be teaching a Harvard level Geology course.
1,I took her online  her test are REALLY hard. Way harder than they should be. She isnt very helpful at all when you ask her questions  her response is usually one sentence long. Basically  if I could go back  I'd definitely take someone else. I usually don't do these  but I look at them and wanted to help others out. Make her your last choice.
5,One of the MOST accessible instructors I have come across in three years!! Jolly on the spot with any assistance you need. Her passion lights up yours. Gotta earn the grade  but you will know the material inside and out. Fab teacher!!
4.5,Ms. Bode is passionate about what she teaches. She is a great instructor. Her classes are not for those who want an easy A. You may get an A - but it will not be easy. If you work at it  you will get an A and you will learn the subject material. If you don't want to work  don't take these classes.
4.5,Had her for several classes  including online classes. Goes above and beyond the standards to help and to answer questions. Always interested in student progress  even after graduation. Knows what she is doing. Has passion for the subjects she teaches. Encouraging personality. One of the best.
5,Ms. Mulcahy is a very good art/design teacher. She is willing to help and is very clear in what she expects from each assignment. Since this is a design/art course  you will be doing many different projects throughout the semester  so it is in your best interest that you go to class!
5,Mrs. Mulcahy was so easy  but the best part is I still learned in this class! Just do the assigments how she wants  have the book and the notes for the online tests  COME TO CLASS  and you will have no trouble making an A. Attendance is huge  and just try to understand what she's asking for on assignments. TURN IN EARLY WORK!! She's great!
5,I'm not even sure if easy is the word for her class. As long as you turn in every assignment and look at the book/notes during the online tests you are basically gaurenteed an A. Also make sure to attend as much as possible that is part of your participation grade. I did everything the day it was due in her class so I'm not joking.
4,Not as hard if you study her notes AND take notes on any keywords and points she makes during lectures. Just pay attention. I got extra points on all of my papers and projects and most of them were done last minute. However  she's so hard on attendance that missing 4 classes last semester dropped my grade a full letter  which was very frustrating.
1.5,Her class was extremely boring and I am an art major! The class was easy  but there was a lot of assignments. As long as you do all the assignments on time and always show up to class you will pass. I never talked in there because she will make you feel stupid. I know a lot about art but she would make me feel so dumb for sharing.
5,Super easy class. She gives extra points for attending class. There is a lot of work  but it is very easy as long as you show up to class and listen to how to do it. I would recommend her for sure!!!!
5,I took her printmaking class. It was very fun! It is not like a highschool art class  where you just make art and it is cool - you must try to make good composition (she cares more about that than subject matter). If you can understand the way she thinks  then you can figure out what she wants and do it! She is a great teacher and knows her stuff!
5,I really did not care for art until I took her class. She is very clear in her class checklist and made me like ART
3.5,ART 101 is Drawing 1. I learned a lot in this class  but it's not a class you can joke about. She is very serious with work because it is a studio class. Students have to be hardworking and show improvement for her to be happy  which is sensible. I do recommend her as a Drawing teacher.
1.5,The worst art class I have ever taken  and this is harsh since I am an art major and love to write. Constantly unclear and became frustrated when you didn't understand. I asked for extra credit because she wanted to use presentation of mine for future use and she accused me of being manipulative. She grades essays hard despite HER terrible grammar.
1.5,why.. why.. why... are all the teachers in the art department insisted on making an easy intro to art class so freaking difficult??? You can't miss a day or you lose 10points off your final grade. You have to buy the expensive book  have to write papers  do quizzes and take test... Are you kidding me??????
2,Very Boring!!! She is elderly and soft spoken. Test are relatively hard
4.5,Very nice and extremely helpful but the most boring class I've ever taken! tests and essays are pretty easy. just so sick of the pics. Ready for class to be over
1,She is way too harsh when grading her essays. I never made below a 90 in my English class but I got 60's on my essays in her class. She thinks she's an English teacher apparently. I had to dumb down my essays to get an A. She did  however  let me re-write my essay  so she isn't heartless.
1,TERRIBLE class. Everyone I knew made a C or lower. It's by far the most boring clas you will ever go to. I LOVE art  but after this class  I rethought my art major.
2.5,She is NOT a bad teacher  is always willing to help if you need it  it's just an extremley BORING class  and is relativley hard.
4.5,Teaches a great foundation is art concepts and technique  takes great care that all the students understand ideas they may be unfamiliar with.
5,you actually learn something--even if you're not interested in art
1,"She's Rude. When asked questions in class she says ""look it up."" ""read your book"" When you ask about due dates in class she tells you ""look online"" ""bring your syllabus to class."" Her lectures are crazy disorganized. Good luck taking notes. Tests are insanely hard. Taking notes and reading the book doesn't help. Papers are easy. Once I liked art..."
1,Top 3 worst teachers I've had at vol state  she is rude and reads from power points every class  all class. Accused me of plagerizing an opinionated paper like I was not capable of producing A material. WOULD NOT TAKE awful teacher.
2,This teacher will kill your GPA  if you looking for an art class just because your major calls for one look further. This is no ordinary art class as the criteria may state. She sucks at everyway she teaches  talks all class  more like a history class. I swear you could take the powerpoints from lecture and still fail her test.
2.5,Very boring class. she seems like she doesn't really come off clear a lot of times.
5,I took this class online. It wasn't bad at all. You get extra credit opportunities. It is very clear what she expects of you. If you can't follow simple directions  it will be reflected in your grade.
3.5,I took her online class. Wow  she expected more writing than my English Comp class did!! Graded fairly easily on discussion posts  but her tests were pretty hard. I finished up with a B.
4,I liked her. As long as you study  take lotssss of notes and keep up with the dates you will do great in her class. She emails back fast too.
1.5,I am taking her online class and she is very rude and does not explain anything.It seems like to me she hates her job and wants to take it out on her students. I do not recommend her at all!!!!
2,I took her for art history and studio. First  she is inexplicably angry at our generation. Unjustly offended by technology. Constantly accusing the class of not caring. Convinced that her work in unappreciated. In studio  she will always have something negative to say. Hardly anything positive. Expects the world out of her students.
5,I took Ms. Hamptons Hybrid art class. The class was very tough & challenging. HOWEVER  I came to college to learn even if it was a subject out of my comfort zone - I learned to appreciate art as I never did before her class. Ms. Hampton is abrupt and to the point however  I loved her! Be prepared to work hard. Your grade doesn't come for free!
4.5,I took her art appreciation class during my first semester of college. Before the class  I was a notorious critic of Matisse- I had never liked his work! But after reading the book and hearing her lectures  I finally admire his work. Take her class with an open mind  and you will do just fine!
4.5,I took this class as a 5 week summer session.I was a lot of work but not hard. You just have to put your best foot forward and try you will do fine. THe biggest problem I had in the class was the rudeness of other students towards her. This class is not meant for an easy A this is college do not expect her to just had you an A and you will be fine.
1.5,She was very rude and demeaning to all of my work that I submitted. She doesn't really teach very well. DO NOT TAKE
5,I really liked her. I had her last semester and I made a A in her class. You have a quiz about every 2 weeks over Art work and the dates and the artists which is a easy A! You write 2 papers in her class. The tests are easy. Just let her know that you want to do well in the class and at least try and you will make a A.
4,I enjoyed her Hybrid Class very much. I think she made the discussions clear and easy to post. She enjoys humor  so apply what you are learning to something real life with a smile on it and you will get high marks. Participation = A
3.5,Regardless of personality flaws and teaching styles  Hampton is still a human being. She deserves respect and appreciation for what she does and the passion she possesses. If you show you are making an effort to LEARN her material  that's all that matters. She doesn't expect you to love art  but to appreciate it. That is key to passing her course.
2.5,I don't understand why teachers have to make a subject like Art so boring and hard...and for the love of Mary  why make students buy a book you don't even use half the time.
4,nice lady.. but takes art 1010 to an extreme. DO NOT take her if you're not a master in writing papers. She acts more like an English teacher than an art teacher at times. Test are easy if you study and go to class. Rarely used the book. You will learn a lot from her but needs to understand that SHE IS NOT AN ENGLISH TEACHER.
1,this woman is extremely rude and hateful. The first day I ever attended school at vol state  I was lost and sent to her to ask her where I should go for my art class. I knocked on her door  and she proceeded to rip the door open and tell me off in front of her class for interupting her lecture. I was mortified. She ruined my first day of college.
1,she is annoying!
1,Alright  let me justify my rating. It's true  he's a nice guy but that's where the benefits end. Sure he gives you test questions  but often  he'll change them or put new questions you never studied. And if you don't word it correctly? WRONG. Lectures are pointless if you're beyond the first row. the books are not easy reading. Stay. Away.
1.5,"This class is horrible (i am in i right now). He does not ""teach"" he expects you to read these complicated ethic books and teach yourself and make your own study guides. So if you don?t understand it you will fail the tests like half this class. 4 HARD tests/quizzes. He is useless as a teacher and isn?t clear with what you should study."
1.5,AVOID. He may be very intelligent but only someone with bionic ears would be able to hear him speak. Yes  it's helpful he gives test questions ahead of time because it would be impossible to pass otherwise. Take philosophy with another professor!
2.5,Roda can be hard to understand since he talks really low   so you might want a seat in the first 3 rows. He is a harsh grader but he looks like he have a curve on most quizess and test. Everything is based on the reading which can be hard to understand themselves. Somethimes he will go overthings that wont be on the test . overall its a hard class.
1,HATED THIS CLASS. Although he may be a 'nice old man' he is nearly impossible to understand  & is the most UNFAIR grader I have ever encountered - does not care how much effort you put in studying wise  there is NO CHANCE of extra credit & his advice 'do better on the next one'. I would NEVER take a class with him again if you paid me.
5,Took ethics with him. He's basically Yoda. I would kill anyone for Roda. He's awesome
1,DONTtake his classes he is about70-80yrs old prob half blind uses a cane has a tube through his throat you wont be able to hear past the 2row.the books were very hard to understand(for me at leastEthics by Frankena was the mostconfusing)i cant tell you enough DONT TAKE HIS CLASS!im warning you nowHE SHOULD BE RETIERD!btw i am an A-B studentNEVER D!
4,tests are hard  but he gives review sheets with exact questions on them  he is hard to understand  but if you do the reading and ask questions the class isn't hard. He will help anyone who wants it.
4.5,cleaar your filthy ears out and listen to this man-- he knows what he is talking about and gives all he has left to do it-- best philosophy doctor in my days
1,Prof. Roda is a HORRIBLE teacher. Ethics and Philosophy are great because they are subjects that allow a lot of personal interpretation. Unfortunately  this deaf/dumb/blind old man  who can barely talk  is a very closed minded individual. Though he TRIES to help you prepare with quizes and tests  he makes it virtually impossible to have the level of patience needed to do well in the class. Im sure he was an outstanding teacher 40 years ago.
4.5,love this guy. you need to grow up and pay attention. ask questions clearly and get a clear response. roda's brilliant but you should try to get in the first row to hear better.
2,Beware the tracheotomy!
4,Dr. Roda is not at all the way most of these reviews make him sound. I don't know how much easier he could make it seeing as he gives you all the test and quiz questions ahead of time. He also offeres to help with any questions you have. In my experience he was a very nice enjoyable teacher.
2.5,No Comments
1,the WORST teacher ever! he speaks softer than a mouse and is extremely rude and cranky... DO NOT i repeat DO NOT choose this teacher! DON NOT!
3.5,hes not as bad as all these ppl make him sound
1,wow... i do not recomend this class with this professor. i speant half my time trying to figure out what hes saying  and the other half screaming at him. no words can explain this class.
1,nearly blind AND deaf  talks too quietly to be heard beyond the second row  sometimes even the first. regularly 10 minutes late to class  tries to make up for it at the end. doesnt explain things well  no comments on tests  unfair grading. worst prof ever
1,very nice man but horrible teacher. Comes late  won't look over work  and is completely deaf. You have to repeat yourself a billion times  and then he still doesn't hear you and tells you to speak up? Imagine how much fun taking attendence was.
3,Very smart man who knows his material. He is a little hard to understand and can't hear well. WHether or not you enjoy his class depends on how much you put into it  he knows an extrodinary amount and would love to impart it to you. You can do well though
5,This class was hard for me  but I haven't been in school or used most of the material covered in real life in 20 years. She was very helpful & was always able to explain how to do the problems when I got stuck. There is a bunch of homework & tests weigh for 70% of your grade. As long as you do the homework you should't have any problems with tests.
3,Mrs. McVey is very smart but has no idea how to explain her knowledge. She does not allow you to use a calculator the whole first half of the class. Her tests are extremely hard  and consist of most of your grade. The homework will take you hours and hours a week  which doesn't count for much. She is a nice person  but I would NOT take her class.
1,Do not take math with this teacher! She is very rude. Talks to you like your stupid if you have any questions. Never responds to emails  and really doesnt care if you pass or fail
1,She is horrible  never answer email and horrible at explaining. Not a good teacher to take
1.5,Powers through lectures. Horrible at explaining how or why things work. Very picky about how she wants answers written  and usually doesn't tell you ahead of time how she wants it written. A bit critical. Basically reads the book off and lets class fend for itself.
5,Love Mrs. McVey. Took her for 2 math classes  she was amazing and caring and helpful. A really great teacher.
4.5,Mrs. McVey is an excellent instructor. She does keep it moving to stay on schedule but she explains everything step by step. She doesn't leave anything out. She is very willing to help you and informs you of all of your resources. She wants you to do good and has a good sense of humor. Will answer any questions. Enjoyed her class!
1.5,Does not slow down for anything. hard core on grading if you don't have a comma in the correct spot the entire problem is wrong. Does not answer questions very well.doesn't explain things well. Expects you to know everything and she is just reviewing you on the material. Not good!
2,I don't know how she has received any good scores as teacher... she is horrible. Flies through the material and doesn't really explain it. When you ask her to slow down or explain she tries but it makes no sense. Her grading is insane and she is not forgiving on small mistakes
4.5,"I had this teacher for college algebra. She is very picky about her grading  she will count the problem incorrect if you don't put ""x="" and other nit pick things. Overall  I don't recommend her. She is helpful  but seemed to go about things the long way."
3,.
5,She is a really good teacher...but her tests and grading aspects are ridiculous. I got a YC in her class because I failed all of the tests  but I got 100's on all the homework. Other than that she is a good teacher  but I perfer not to take her again
5,I had to take this class because I didn't get a good ACT score  so I already knew what I was doing. She is one of the best math teachers I have ever had. She really knows how to break everything down  so you can understand. Although you can not use calculators  she makes everything easy enough to be able to do without one.
5,Mrs. McVey is one of the best math teachers I've ever known. Math can be difficult for lots of people  but I watched Mrs. McVey help even the dumbest person understand what they were doing. She is very detailed and picky but it is beneficial to the student. She is very fair and respectful of everyone. Period.
4,This is an incredible teacher  however  you must be ready to work with no book. That is very unconventional for us older students  but you will make it. She will go above and beyond her calling to make sure you get the lessons
3,As a person she is wonderful and kind. I shouldn't have taken the 7 week class since it went too fast. I was there everyday and did my best  but transfered out of her class and into a full semester of Elm Alg. I now have an A. I didn't like the fact if you didn't finish checking your work because you see it in your head  she'll mark you wrong.
5,This teacher is extremely helpful. She won't move on to the next lesson until everone understands. The course is 7 weeks long and moves pretty quick. Attendence is key to pass
2,This is the most horrible teacher I have ever had. She wont allow you to make up tests. She makes your final counts double or triple.Even though I had a doctors note and a field trip for another class. Recently she has been behind and has taught around 9 lessons in 2 class periods.At this point only around 3 people are passing her class.
4.5,she is wonderful
3,I do not like her. I feel that she doesn't care about your grade and she will not help you unless you schedule for help on her time. I would not recommend this teacher.
5,Super easy class if you like math. He will help you any way you can. I took him for 1005 and now 1530
5,Mr. Harville is wonderful. I took his math 1005 online and have a 100 avg. so far. The class work is easy. No complaints!
5,I took his online class during the summer. He was very lenient If i could not get past a section by his due date he would give me some extra time also he would give me options to get help. Section 14 i think was the hardest but just Pass that and it gets easier! Make sure you do the notebook HE DOES collect those.
3.5,His online class was HARD!!!
5,Mr.Harville is an excellent instructor that will do anything that he can to help. I wouldn't say that is class is easy but if you make a good effort you can make an A in his course. If you take this course make sure that you complete all homework assignments and review test
4,Hes a nice guy  willing to do whatever it takes for you to learn the material. I took it in the summer and It wasn't easy by no means. I spent alot of extra time in the Math lab so I could understand it. I would have LOVED to take him in a longer semester! And yeah...he's not too bad looking for an older man!
4,He is a pretty good teacher. Take him in the summer because it is really easy. He gives you a study guide with everything on that will be on the test. You do have to teach yourself most of the time but the book is really good at explainging problems well and he does a lot of examples in class. Take him in the summer it goes by fast!!
1.5,Had a B average in there until the final and made a C. He is not very clear and will interrupt himself while working out a problem to go on a tangent. Not recommended.
3,i took lawson for college algebra and i must say that at times his teaching methods can be confusing. hes a little irritated by somethings but only if class gets out of hand a bit. he recommends to only use the website and not the book. i learned more in the math lab.
3.5,Mr. Lawson is a remarkably helpful and interested professor. He is not easy  but he is very fair. He really wants you to do well. Although I know some people think him confusing  I took him after barely making it through highschool math classes  and he is the first teacher I have understood. He has a bit of a temper  so don't smart mouth him.
3.5,Mr. Lawson is a good teacher. Sometimes he allows himself to get distracted (and he does lecture on his personal beliefs occasionally)  but he's usually very helpful. I had a very easy time with his class  but  admittedly  I already knew the material and was simply getting an easy Math credit. Still  I would reluctantly recommend him.
1.5,I graded for Mr. Lawson and the way that he grades homework does not help the students. He simply wanted me to check that it was done not whether it was right or wrong. Staff in the advising center told me not to take him when I asked them which teacher I should take. Students have told me that he is very hard to understand and not helpful.
5,Cares about the students. I highly recommend him.
4,I had never gotten higher than a C in highschool  i got a B+ in his class!!!
2,Terrible Teacher! As a person he is pretty nice  but hes teaching style is so confuseing and tests are really hard. WOULD NOT RECCOMEND HIM!
1,I couldnt tell if he was lecturing math or about the soccer club...
2.5,Flake is right! I used to play 'how long can we distract lawson today?' in every class  which was easy anyways  but we got up to an hour before he noticed.. If you don't want to work you butt off  take this guy.
1,I showed up for every class  took notes  paid attention and still couldn't follow this guy. what a flake
4.5,I LOVED THIS CLASS!! As long as you don't miss alot & do your homework  there's no way that you couldn't have at least a B in this class. I rarely studied & got an A. He makes class fun to sit through by telling stories or jokes. Everyone needs to take him for college level algebra!!
5,No Comments
5,I learned so much from professor Lawson. He really explains things well. I always felt uplifted because of his positive attitude towards life. I will consider him one of my favorite all time teachers.
2,"He is a very kind man and is willing to set aside Fridays for ""study groups"" if you are available. His teaching is mediocre  and students correct his problems AT LEAST 3 times a day  so watch out for his work. His tests are medium-challenging and must do homework to understand them. The exam is extremely difficult  so better do good on those tests"
1,Terrible teacher. Cannot get a full thought out. Will tell you incorrect information and even if you are correct  will tell you that he is correct. Does not understand electronics and makes you do the class on the computer without any clue as to how to do it. Makes you buy a book for $150 and doesn't let you use it.
1,He was horrible the first week. He confused everyone and sometimes just doesn't seem to know what he is talking about. He tells stories that have nothing to do with class. HE IS THE WORSE! DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS!
4,Professor Conrad is a very fair grader and certainly wants his students to understand the material. He had multiple study sessions outside of class. There is a lot of out of class work that he assigns  however  it really helps you understand each and every topic.
1,AWFUL!!! I had him as a professor for college algebra while I was still in high school. Whenever anyone asked him a question  he hardly ever answered the question being asked. When he would try to show someone how to work out a problem  he would get it wrong. I basically had to teach myself.
1,I have always been a good math student  so good it is my major. However  Conrad is a TERRIBLE teacher. He is hard to follow  and is corrected by his students AT LEAST once a day. Might as well take it online  because you will be teaching yourself. I will probably retake  because his 4 test are 90% of your grade and his grading makes no sense.
2.5,He teaches directly from the book and is very boring. Makes many mistakes on the board and has to be corrected by students. 4-5 tests (90% of grade) and homework (10% of grade). Very difficult if you are not naturally good at math.
4,Conrad's class is very difficult because it's calculus. He doesn't do a great job at explaining the material during class  but if go to his office and ask for help he'll explain it much better. You don't have to show up to his class if you know calculus by heart. Don't let him intimidate you during the first couple of weeks either. He is a nice man
1.5,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU HAVE NEVER TAKEN CALCULUS OR TRIG! Overall  I've had a horrible experience in this course. I didn't not learn anything from him. I had too go home and learn the material by myself. Many of the problems on his tests are different from the homework he assigned. He is very sarcastic and expects you to already know e.
3,To be honest  he is a smart person at Math. Can he teach  no. It is kind of like Einstein teaching a little boy about his own theories. Only uses the book's examples  not his own. You would have to have additional help in order to pass his class. The text book wast horrible at explaining things.
1,This guy seriously needs to retire. Get ready to teach yourself or fail the class. He doesn't explain anything. He expects you to already know how. All homework and quizzes are in math-labs. The tests are proctored and count 70 percent of your grade. Do NOT take!
4,He is an excellent teacher for MATH MAJORS. I highly recommend taking a different teacher if you are not a math major. He teaches fundamentals of math  not formulas. If you are not a math major  pay attention and show up to study groups.
4.5,Conrad is not as bad as the reviews. Took a night class and he was always concerned with the students understanding the material before continuing to the next assignment. We used mathlabs for all the hw and quizzes so a lot of self learning and studying but Conrad did teach well in my opinion. Funny guy too. Would take again.
1.5,Not an excellent teacher. Doesn't do a very good job of explaining the material required. Homework and quizzes are all online  his due dates change at random. Things will be due when they haven't even been discussed in class. Nice man  but I don't recommend him.
1,can not teach!!!!
2,My misery...my nightmare!!!
1,Worst teacher!!! Would come in late still eating lunch  take smoke breaks or go get more lunch. No in class work or help! All on time! Took this class again and made an A (with other professor)
2.5,Mr. Conrad was a funny guy but his teaching method is a lot different then what i'm use to. If your someone who understands math easy  you'd probably enjoy his class  otherwise i'd recommend taking another teacher!!!!
4.5,Mr. Conrad is a great teacher. I am terrible at math and had to take developmental courses  all of which I took with Conrad. He helped me figure it out and as long as you go to class and do the work he gives you the benefit of the doubt. He's a great instructor. I'm in college algebra now and when I ask questions  he always helps willingly.
1.5,Makes you feel stupid. he expects you to already know all the material and does not teach you anything you couldnt read off a powerpoint. no book work all online and test are 80 percent of the grade.
5,Great teacher! If you pay attention and come to class you will do fine! She's very understanding and always there to help! She will reward those who try and comes to class. Would defiantly take again!
4,Mrs. Johnson is an all around decent professor. I am not good at math whatsoever  so I have trouble in her class. However  she is understanding. Do not miss her class if you don't have to  trust me  you will regret it. She is pretty good at explaining things and will help you further. I don't have anything bad to say about her.
2,"In her probability and statistics class  she does not explain things well at all. She did not show us how to use statcrunch bc ""we can't use it on tests"" (it was made for online hw!) So online hw takes HOURS. She does not drop lowest grade or provide extra credit. So if you don't understand her complex teaching  you are screwed."
5,Mrs. Johnson is a wonderful teacher  one of the best I have ever had. She genuinely cares about the success of her students and wants them to do good. She is more than willing to help when a student needs extra help. She tries to teach each lesson several different ways because everyone learns differently. HIGHLY recommend this teacher!
5,Mrs. Johnson is one of the most compassionate teachers I have ever had. She takes the time to make sure that you understand the material and she is extremely understanding of the situation of her students. Ive never had a teacher take so much interest in my academic welfare. When you need help she is ALWAYS there. I really lucked out!
4,The class itself was hard at first  then it got easier. Did not have a good experience with the teacher. She was very rude and not encouraging either. When time came for students to drop the class  she said  if anybody wants to drop let me know so I can get forms ready. She should be encouraging us to continue and help. Not drop it.
2.5,Maybe she is different on campus than online. I took 1410 & 1420 online. She did not seem to care or be helpful at all. So far  she is the teacher I am most dissatisfied with. I had a great GPA and made mostly A's before making my first C in her classes. She doesn't seem to have any care that some people work full time.
3.5,Great teacher. She cares about your grades and always makes sure you understand the material.
4.5,This is one of the most helpful Math teachers that I have ever had for a class! She goes out of her way to help you out and usually responds very quickly to emailed questions
5,Take her class! She actually cares about her students and wants to help them as much as possible:)
5,She will go out of her way to help you with any problem that you may have. She uses her own mnemonic devices to help you understand better the mechanics of Math 1130. A++ teacher!! Take her!
5,She is an awesome teacher!!! There is nothing bad to say about Mrs. Johnson. If you speak up and say you need help  she will go above and beyond to help! She truly cares and wants her students to succeed. She is an exceptional teacher and person. TAKE HER IF AT ALL POSSIBLE!
5,Amazing teacher! Had her for my online College Alg class  and she is so helpful with any questions you have. I would take one of her classes anytime!
4.5,She is not easily frustrated when students ask questions  but she usually explains things really well. Homework is due on test days. Tests are not very hard. She tries to make the lessons fun and interesting. She also gives advice on how to teach lessons in the classroom. I wish I had taken her for 1410! She really wants to see her students succeed
4.5,She is a great teacher! She will help you  just as long as you ask her. I hated math  but she made the class interesting. She makes her tests sound hard  but they are easy. Promise. You have homework with no definite deadline and a fun tessalation.. basically easy grades. I highly recommend her!
2.5,had a bad experience with this class because she decided at the last minute to make it an online class which I didn't like  but when I voiced how I felt about it  she was quick to tell me she would NOT let me fail. She even held optional study meetings and was extremely helpful. Math is not my subject but she helped alot!! Wld take her again.
4.5,I think Mt. Johnson is an awesome teacher and is one of the few that really care if you get it or not. If you don't understand speak up and she will help you anyway she can to make sure you understand. I can't say enough good things about her. I hate algebra and she helps you get it even when it is hard for you.I got a B and I suck in this area.
4.5,Mrs. Johnson can get carried away at times and leave the students confused  but if you ask questions she will clarify things for you. She tries to read people's expressions  but no one is a mind reader. If you take her and don't understand  speak up! There were 4 tests and a final  the lowest grade is dropped.
5,I just love her. She is SO helpful & understanding. I hate math  and she tries so hard to make sure you understand everything. She takes her time and puts math on a level that you understand. I cant say enough great things about her :) TAKE HER CLASS !!!
4,I'm not sure but I do think that Shelly Fenton's tests are easier. I took this class at the same time that a friend of mine was taking Fenton's and her tests seemed easier. Ms. Johnson is awesome though! I took this hybrid
4,If you at least attempt all of the homework  you'll do fine in Dr. Sowell's class. The start of each class will be spent going over homework and this is where most of the learning takes place IMO. As a teacher she was fair  respectful  and very accessible to all of us. My only complaint is that we ran out of time near the end and had to rush.
4,Dr. Sowell is great and she knows what shes doing. But  I feel she could work on her teaching skills. She moves very fast and sometimes dosent show every step of the problem. For someone who is a Bio major and not math inclined this can prove hard. She has really strengthed my math skills though. Take her shes great  youll just have to work hard.
5,I really enjoyed Dr. Sowell's class. She is there to help her students and cares about how you do in the class. You have homework every night and tests are weighted heavy  but if you do the homework you should to good on tests. I would recommend her!!
1,At first she seemed very enthusiastic about teaching the class. After a while she seemed to get confused and second guessed herself and wasn't very helpful a lot of the time. Outside of class she was pretty responsive. Other than going over homework questions and being redundant with lectures  I felt as if no one was really learning anything.
2,She is a really nice person  but her lectures are hard to follow. She kinda is all over the place. She takes forever to answer emails and is hardly ever physically in her office. However she gives lots of partial credit on test which saved me. If you dont do the homework or study you wont pass.
1,"She is a nice enough individual but absolutely NO help for the subject. The only ""teaching"" that she does is hand out print outs of how to use stat crunch and most of the time what she gives you is unclear and the examples are not helpful at all. I would only recommend taking this class if you want to teach yourself how to do statistics."
1,"Had her for an online course. I've never had a professor who was less helpful. I emailed several times for clarification on specific types of problems  and she told me ""Spend more time studying."" When I was already spending more time on this class than my other 4 combined. Would not recommend her for an online class!"
4,Dr. Sowell is AWESOME! Took her for Elemantary Statistics and dreaded it from day one! She made it as easy as possible and explained everything very well. Tests were not too bad  but the hw is online which I hated.. She genuinly cares wether you learn or not and will do anything to help you as long as you put in the effort! I DEFINATELY reccomend!!
5,One of the best Teachers I've had. Enrolled in her class for Differential Equations and Cal II.
4.5,I took her for an online class. She is a great teacher always helpful! The book work gets alittle hard but its not her making it up!
4.5,Excellent teacher in online courses. As long as you asked questions  she would help you out. I made an A after being out of Math for 10 years. I strongly recommend her if Math is not a good subject for you.
3.5,Didnt respond to emails quickly at all. I had to go out of town for a family emergency and asked to take a proctered test from my laptop but she said NO so i failed the midterm for reasons out of my control. I still passed her class but she was not very helpfull OR sympathetic towards my situation at all. Not a good online teacher to take.
5,Great teacher..I had her for college algebra online and came out with an A after being absent from math for 6 years!! She was very helpful to me and I hope I have her again as a prof in the future.
5,Dr. Rita Sowell is the best teacher I've ever had. I took Calc II and Diff Eq. from her and absolutely loved it...which is saying a lot about her. While she expects you to work hard  she does everything in her power to help you  and sincerely cares about her students. I'm almost sorry for this semester to be over just cause I won't have her again.
4.5,Great professor. Made it easy to comprehend in class and made great use of electronic notes.
4,This was a online class  you do all your work & tests at home(except final)If you ever needed help Ms Sowell would work problems for you or offer to meet you online. She seems real nice and I would take her class!
4,online class. work was consistent but not over bearing. i am taking her now for college algebra. good teacher and most of the times understanding about late work and having it extended to complete it
4,Professor is very nice and is willing to help BUT: I done decent in the class. Grades weren't great - but certainly not the worst. I failed the final so she failed me for the entire semester. I have to take it again. There is nothing fair about this!
1,A mistake.
1.5,online class was really hard  went too fast. Would not put lectures up until the day the assignment was due
5,This dude is a boss. While there is a lot of writing it really isn't that bad and there is no test. Got a B in the class and didn't even use the book
4.5,Very open-minded and articulate. He'll be there for you when you need it.
3,Very intelligent in the subject but requires too much irrelevant work. No tests is an upside but all the papers make up for it.
4.5,2-3 page paper due every week and one 10-15 pg paper due at the end which is going to suck. And a group project on a chapter in the book. nice guy  VERY VERY intelligent and knows this subject up and down. just follow the syllabus on the papers and you should be fine. I would recommend.
5,great professor. 9 2-3 page papers due each week and one final 12 page paper. no final exam. attendance not mandatory.
4,Not a bad professor. He's interesting  you have a 2-3 page paper due each week. Not bad I usually read the chapter the night before. You have a 15 page paper due at the end  but I basically put all my paper together and it worked out perfectly. Oh yeah you have a group presentation  but it's basically one chapter out the book. Attendance IS NOT mandatory.
2,There's a lot of work but the papers take less than like an hour to write. The only hassle the whole year is the ridiculous 15 page paper...no paper needs to be that long to get a point across. you dont really have to even to go to class except for the presentation day and to turn in your papers. easy class if you do the work
5,Great Class!No exams!There are 9 2-3 pg chapter reflections a 15 page paper  a group project and frequent class discussions.But if you take into account you have one paper due per week and the rest of the time it's just very interesting discussion with no tests to cram for.You really learn the information and it will be with you for life.TAKE HIM!
4.5,Don't listen to the slackers. If you enjoy CJ and actually want to learn something novel and challenging and DIFFERENT  take his classes. He can be challenging  but he helps you and doesn't attack you like other professors. His classes usually mean a lot of reading and discussion  but it's well worth it. Also  his graduate classes are ROCKING.
5,Bruce Arrigo really motivates you to think outside your box  which is nice.
4.5,Simply put  Dr. Arrigo is the man. Common sense in a sea of lunacy
2.5,This guy is full of himself. Don't bother doing the reading because it won't help.
5,This was a PHENOMENAL Honors Capstone course!!! Clear and challenging  thought provoking and enjoyable.
5,I had Dr. Arrigo a number of years ago as a graduate student  and his classes were nothing like what these freshmen are describing. Attendance was mandatory  class discussions were stimulating  and papers were challenging. He was one of the best teachers I ever had.
3,no need to go to class  tests are take home... they are tricky though  so take your time. my major is criminal justice and learned NOTHING. haha
4,Just like the other guy said  take home tests straight out of the Book in order  no need to attend class  interesting topics discussed in class sometimes.
3,he doesn't take attendence. the tests are take home tests. no point in even going to class. but questions on tests are kind of tricky. easy A if you really look hard for the answers on the tests.
2,Dont bother showing up to class  his tests are take home and open book. His lectures are indepth and boring. I only went on test days to get my test and got an A.
5,No Comments
3.5,Awesome class... excellent professor. I learned more and enjoyed this class more than ANY other in the criminal justice department. IF you have any interest in criminal law whatsoever... you'll love it.
5,I HATE MATH. This Gentleman taught his class in such a way not only did I understand it  I enjoyed it.
5,Great Professor! Helps you as much as needed. This was such an easy A!!! Req'd lots of homeworj  but tests were not hard.
3.5,Stick with it and it will be an easy A.
5,very easy class!turn in all your homework easy A and also tests are open notes and sometimes open book!!some questions on the test come straight from there!also very nice main and also has bonus questions!!i got an A in this class and i am horrible in math!!
4.5,Nice Professor.
5,Ms. Fenton is cool. She does not count attendance as a grade  but she notices if students are not present  so DO NOT SKIP CLASS. Take her class. She will call on you to answer questions in class  so be prepared to speak when called upon. Oh! Show all of your work on tests! Memorize all formulas early in the semester! She cares.
3,I had prof Fenton for algebra. She lectures over everything you need to know  but moves very quickly and if you slow her down she will make you feel dumb for asking a question. If you pay attention  show up for class  and do the homework its an easy A.
5,I had professor Fenton for College Algebra. She made all the concepts very clear and worked through problems in a very thorough manner. She always makes time for questions and will work with anyone who is having trouble with the material.
3,She's interesting... Like everyone else said  she'll make you feel dumb if you slow her down with questions  but she is still willing to help. She's very understanding if you're respectful but I wouldn't exactly recommend her. If you are semi good at math and pay attention for the most part  you should be okay though.
3,I wouldn't recommend this class if you know you are not great at math. She moves really fast. If you slow her down by asking a question  she'll make you feel stupid.
4.5,Professor Fenton saved my bacon more than once. I took her for College Algebra  math and I don't mix very well. I made a D my first time through  B in the maymester course. She is a wonderful teacher and always tries to help her students. If you have problems you can't be afraid to speak up. She also gives partial credit in maymester course! :)
2,Professor Fenton is brilliant. Her class was very hard for me though. I felt like she had a very difficult time getting across what she was teaching. She starts a point and then changes it 2 or 3 times before she gets it sorted out in her mind. She's sweet and helpful though.
1.5,I took Prof. Fenton for Math 1410 and I struggle with math. She is very sweet but she is very confusing when she tries to teach. She got upset when we asked questions and when I asked for help she made me feel stupid. I did not enjoy her class and wouldn't recommend her.
5,This was the second time I had taken College Algebra. Previously I had scored a C  with Prof Fenton I recieved an A. I really enjoyed her class  she took the time to explain things well and she had patience with everyone in the class.
4,I had Fenton for Math 1410. It was basically the online class with class time. We did everything online. Never used my book  so just get the online code. I do not struggle in math  so I did fine. I know others that really did struggle and she really helped them. She's a little socially awkward  but still nice. I would take her again.
3,I am actually good at math so I did not struggle in this class. I did my assignments and that was all I had to do. Never had to study. I know others that struggled and she really worked with them so they would understand and make a good grade. Her social skills are a little off  but she is really nice. I would take her again.
4.5,I had her for College Algebra this summer and she was wonderful. I have never been good at math and she would explain it to me until I understood. She is very serious about math  but I think it's awesome that my MATH teacher likes MATH:) She's very sweet and a great teacher.
2,She's a good teacher but boring most of the time. Wouldn't reccommend her..
2,I had Fenton for 1410 and Johnson for 1420 and I have to say Johnson is way better. Fenton gets lost in mid sentence. A LOT. She seems to be nice  but lacks social skills. Her tests are hard even when she gives a study guide. I am in no way trying to talk about her bad. I just believe Johnson is way better at teaching the subject.
2.5,She is a nice lady.. but she's sort of hard to understand.. and really scatterbrained... I truly think she wants her students to pass... but she isn't exactly easy to understand.. and her tests are difficult. Especially since she teaches the new lesson right before the test on the last chapter.. it makes it confusing..
5,Shes super sweet and wants to help but shes a bit scatterbrained. Did not let me make up a test when i missed for illness so be careful about that and make sure you talk to her when you have to miss.
4,I don't really have a problem with her its just that she teaches in a very weird way  and different from what I've been taught prior. And she treats college algebra like its THE most important class you will ever take. I wouldn't take her again..
4,She's a nice lady but she's not the best teacher. She gets off track and kind of bounces around in her lessons. Each question on her tests count for a ridiculous amount of points. She also seems like one of those people who let things build up then will explode on you. If I had to do it over again  I wouldn't take her.
4,Tests count as a rediculous amount  but gives opportunity for redemption!!
5,"Talk about a professor that cares! She will do whatever it takes to explain it to you! I would for sure take her if you feel you need a kind  rather ""meek"" teacher that can really teach! Super nice!"
5,best math teacher i ever had.
4.5,Professor Morrison is a genuinely nice and humorous person  and creates an extremely conducive classroom environment for learning trig.
5,I had prof. Muldrow for Math and Computer and he is very easy to talk to. He is funny in a goofy way. He is very helpful  you just have to ask. I have had three of his classes  I wish I could take my last math class with him. I truly recommend taking whatever classes he is teaching.
5,Very nice guy. He will go over everything with you step-by-step. He does not give too much homework. He is funny in a very dorky way.
5,This guy is a awesomest teacher. He has a really funny dorky personality. He makes the class fun and is willing to give his students a break. His lectures are really really helpful.
4.5,Funny guy.. likes 3 stoogis.. Reviews are exactly like quizes.. just study.
5,muldrow rocks. hes funny and very understanding. knows his stuff and makes learning fun. w00t for CIS120 root beer floats. id take him over any prof any day.
5,Nice Professor  knows stuff.
5,funny professor he makes you laugh and he helps you on any problem   i will take him again anytime
5,Great Professor had her in Fall 08 for online course. Very helpful and kept in touch with emails. I would take her again if I could. Highly recommend her!!
3,I took her online Elementary Algebra class. She was an okay teacher. The videos and notes were very helpful  but she wasn't really that helpful. She took forever responding to emails  and she wouldn't let you make up any work. She wasn't the worst teacher  but she wasn't the best either!
4,Ms. Jones is an awesome professor. she is really nice and if you pay attention  she makes math easy to comprehend
5,I really liked Ms. Jones. I thought she was a great teacher and I would recommend her for people who are afraid of algebra and need extra help.
2.5,"i would never take her again... the homework was on the computer and the test were on paper and if the clas doesnt understand something and you ask a question she says she has ""office hours"" most people had stopped coming by the end of the semevery sit was packed at the start if your not good with math on the computer i wouldnt take her"
1,She was unwilling to help  she taught horrible  but I will give her the credit of being a nice person.
5,I had her for Elementary Statistics and she was a very helpful teacher  she made sure that you understood what we were covering at the time.
1.5,Hard to understand!
5,Ms. Jones is an excellent teacher! She goes over our homework with us in class  works the problems out on the board and goes step by step through the problem. She doesn't move on till whoever was confused is now clear on the issue. She goes into great detail teaching math and explains math in terms of our everyday life. Take her for math!!!
4.5,No Comments
4.5,She's a very nice teacher and is understanding and willing to help out if you don't get the material
2.5,she's cool
4,I took Dr. Hardyway's online psychology course. He is a tough grader  and you must turn everything in on time! He does not respond to emails right away. However  if you email him  he will answer any questions or concerns you may have. You must participate in discussions or you will fail. This class is very fast paced  but interesting!!!
2,I have struggled with this class this semester online. teacher requires you to sign in and respond to posts on 4 different days which kind of defeats the purpose of online classes and working at my schedule. terrible response time on emails. I have been waiting for a response on an assignment for a week now. whole class has same issue.
3,I took her online Development Psychology course. It was kind of hard to stay on top of the assignments. She would make a lot of things due on one day about a month ahead of time and let the students do it as they pleased. Some may like this approach  but I found it difficult to remember to do assignments until the last minute.
1,I took professor Hardyway's general psych class online for a filler class. Worst professor I've had in 3 years. Takes a long time to respond and very tough grader with no response for help. Wouldn't take his class again  not online at least.
4,So glad I read his reviews before I started work in his class. If you take him make sure you are detailed with the module questions (I mean 15-20 pages per module) and only use his links to answer the questions. He gives unlimited attempts on tests  so take advantage! Be active with discussions too! Class is a lot of work but you'll learn a lot.
5,He was a very tough grader  but graded very fairly to what you actually knew. I used the textbook quite a lot also to answer his questions. He has certain papers to write that you NEED the textbook for or else you might not get a good grade. But overall  he was a great professor and I am very glad I took him for psychology.
5,He is VERY specific on how assignments are completed. Make sure you complete 4 initial discussion posts b4 deadline  retake exam tests-he gives unlimited attempts. You MUST be DETAILED and give essay answers in your OWN words!! Class is not hard  but requires lots of time/effort. Fair/lenient grading  IF you follow directions  and he offered E.C.
1,"Refused to grade my assignments  citing ""book page number not shown"" when I didn't even have the book. It was listed on the class website that I would receive credit if I used and cited the class page sources  which I did. When I complained to him about this  he gave me next to nothing points for the assignments. Then  a few weeks out from the end of the semester  he told me there was no way I could re-do my assignments  and that I would need to make perfect scores on all assignments and quizzes and tests from then until the end of the semester if I wanted to pass  even having the gall to suggest re-taking the class during the summer. Horrible teacher. Do not take his class! If I could give a rating lower than one star  I would."
2.5,Literally couldn't win w/this teacher. Essay Q's-answered them &included pg #'s either I really suck at essay questions or he just hates me but I got 20 out of 75 points my heart sank. Research activity-combined part 2 with part3 because they were the same & he didn't give me the points for part2 because according to him I didn't complete it. Boo!
4,Loved this class. I took it in High School and often find myself comparing him to professors I have now. He is so funny and lectures were interesting. We even took a field trip to a women's prison. Very helpful and knows how to entertain students.
3,A student shouldn't have to turn in assignments over and over to get credit for work they have already completed. I constantly had to reprint assignments. He also asked questions in class that you got points for but didn't write down the right people to receive points. May have to take class again bc it hurt my GPA and I am an A student. SUCKS!
3,I had him for psych  online! I do not recommend taking his class online. He is a very smart guy and the class is well organized  1 test  1 open discussion  1 research project and 15 essay questions once or twice a month! The test are not that bad with google  but the essay questions will HURT your grade big time. If you are a lazy don't take.
3,He is a good teacher. Tests are extremely hard! If you read the chapters thoroughly it will give you a lot better of an understanding. There is not a lot of supplemental materials for what to study. Tests are over 4 chapter and I find it difficult to know the most significant topics out of 4 chapter. Stay involved in discussions!
1,Worst teacher I have ever had. let me explain why. He has one assignment where you have to answer 15 essay questions. So I answered them all with a pretty large paragraph each  but I forgot to include what page numbers I found each answer from in the book So I got a 10/75 grade. So i could have just gave the page numbers and got a 65/75?
2,I am in his online class right now and I hate it. He rarely sends out emails and when I emailed him about a test it took him over a week to reply (it wasn't helpful at all). His tests have nothing to do with the subject  although you do have the option of taking it twice if you want. Maybe he's better in person. I won't take him again though.
1.5,I took PSYC1030 online with him. I did get a B but it was endless hours of busy work having little to do with understanding the subject. He didn't accept late work and any questions if answered at all were answered after the assignment due date had passed rendering them useless. I would not recommend him or take him again.
4,Took his class while still in HS
4,Took this class online. His tests are VERY hard. On the homework assignments  being very detailed increases your grade. Make sure to follow instructions carefully on research activities  or you will lose major points!! I enjoyed the class though  and would take him again.
4.5,Dr.Hardway was great  the class is was easy. Test are not easy  you have to read. Overall he is a great teacher.
4,"I took him online this summer. His tests are crazy hard and some of the questions I couldn't find in the book nor on ""google"" after the exam. I received B's and C's on tests  but aced the homework assignments. They take FOREVER to finish  but the more detailed you are  the better your grade! Post often on discussion boards! I still got an A! :)"
1,she's a sweet woman  but man...her lectures were based on opinion. and the actual work was online. its not fair because if we wanted an online course we would have taken one...but oh well. overall  dont take her unless you want to be FORCED into hearing her VERY BIASED opinion  watching boring films from the 80's and doing EVERYTHING online.
1.5,Teacher was terrible. Made a B in the class but nothing of what she says in class will be on the tests or quizzes. She has some computer program make them for her and the questions come out of the text. She has a attendance policy but I could have made the same grade without ever stepping foot in her class.
1,i hated her class. so disorganized and would go off topic very easily. quizes were nothing she had said in class. tests are online and that was the only good part about it
2,Do NOT take this woman for a video course... For one  it will turn into an online course. Two  the workload is absolutely ridiculous! If you do  you will regret it!
2.5,Took the class on video. I will never do that again. All material came straight from the book. Only two tests so they covered at least 7 chapters each. The text was a HORRIBLE read! I recommend not taking her  especially not during the summer.
2,She liked to single minorities out and ask them things about their culture. I would have felt uncomfortable it were me...
4,She is very hard. I ended up changing teachers because I was spending more time outside class doing the assisgments that was required. She also requires you to turn in everything online and take every test online  so if you do not have a computer and do not want to spend your entire semester on this class only  do not take her.
1,Mrs. Lawson is out to brain wash all of her student into thinking like she does. She insists that you agree with her and if you don't  she might throw you out of class. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!
4,A little collectivist but goodhearted.
1.5,She is the meanest womman i've ever met. she needs to retire and you wont learn a thing
2,Very funny
4,Mrs. Lawson was a great teacher. She uses the book website for all of the quizzes and tests. People that don't read fast shouldn't take her b/c her online quizzes and tests are timed  it seems only the slow readers complained about that. She uses a lot of supplemental material in class  which i thought was great. I would recommend her to anyone.
2.5,ok teacher. notes in class do not pertain to test. go to the book's website and read chapter summary and take chapter test. a lot of questions come from there. didn't read book a lot. make sure you take notes on the movie clips beacuse she uses those on the final. overall she was an ok teacher.
2.5,MS. Lawson  This is the most hardiest class i ever took in my life. take notes in class but not on her tests. use Publisher website alot. tests are very hard. most of every thing is online as far as tests  quizes  and assigments. also every thing oniine as far as tests and quizes are timed.
1.5,She is extremely liberal... if attendance wasn't required I would have never gone to class. The things that she lectures aren't on the test any way  but you must take notes because that will be your final exam. Everything is online  and it's all straight from the book. I didn't like her teaching style  or her opinions  at all.
4.5,Ms. Lawson is a pretty good teacher. Be prepared to read  though! Nothing said in class is on the tests. Use the publisher's website a lot. It is a tremendous help. She has a habit of talking about her personal beliefs  though  which can get annoying b/c we're paying to learn Psych  not listen to her beliefs.
3.5,She is an okay teacher. Good luck on the test  b/c nothing she says in class is on her test. Test comes straight from the book. You better read!
5,i loved ms lawson!! great teacher!!!
5,She has to be one of the greatest teachers.
5,I liked her teaching style. If you're thinking about taking her  go ahead  you'll learn a lot and it will be an easy grade. However  I warn about her quizes on the computer. It sucks being timed while doing a quiz but you'll get the hang of it.
5,Thought this class was easy as long as you go to class. Just the paper and the presentation is your grades. She literally tells you exactly what to put in the paper if you go to class. Would've gotten an A But I used an outline during the presentation
4,no intellectual bullying..i liked this
5,loved the professor extra credit helps
5,enjoyed the class. enjoyed the professor wish every one read the material
5,liked the number of graded assignments
4,I liked the way she taught we got written and oral credit. It was a lot of worl but it was all well worth it.
4,Good class. Liked the paper of my work even though it is not criminal justice. Take her
5,interesting class
4.5,Loved her and her class. She really cares if you get it:)
5,Great class. Thought her book was great.
3.5,I was really excited to take this class  but it really disappointed. The worst thing that happened this semester was the online book she made us buy  but then told us not to use it after test 2 and we didn't get a refund. This class isn't attendance based  but I would really suggest going because the tests are hard.
4.5,She has experience in the field  so she knows what she is talking about and provides good insight. Has guest speakers. Attendance not mandatory. Will do anything to help you  if you ask.
4.5,Great interest Great professor 2
5,Only grades in the class are 3 exams. Tests are easy if you take notes and study. Tests are 35 multiple choice. Gives a few extra credit points if you go to class. She shows several movies and has several guest speakers. Great class and great professor. Would absolutely take again! Attendance not mandatory and textbook not needed
4,challenging class excellent lectures
4.5,Good teacher. Always there to help. Easy A. Only 3 tests that are 35 questions each.
2,She's nice  lectures are easy in the sense that there's no participation and we get out of class early a lot. She can be confusing though in lectures and rambles. We watched a lot of videos and had some guest speakers. We don't really have review sessions for exams and they're pretty hard. She won't go over exams with you after the test is taken.
4.5,It is her class so she can say because I said so. I think that she is smart and loved the class
2,The class has nothing to do with Criminal Justice. I did not learn anything but how to write the paper that is due at the end of class.
5,I love Dr. Coston! She is great and very helpful. It was a pleasure taking a class with her and look forward to take more classes. She really care for students.
5,Fantastic Teacher. Very helpful. She only required to read the chapter and take a quiz
5,Aka mrs. hurley... shes such a great teacher  very easy and gets your final project out of the way during the 1st 2 or 3 weeks... she gives time for everything and your VERY RARELY in there for the whole period
5,No Comments
5,I really like Mrs. Goostree. She is a nice person and her class is really fun.
5,She is a wonderful teacher. I highly recommened taking her.
5,Ms. Hinkle was the best. So nice and encouraging. She understands the adult learners that she teaches...great class
4.5,SO EASY! Her quizzes are harder than her tests because the tests are the exact same questions that were on the quizzes that SHE GIVES BACK!
5,I've had her for two psychology classes  PSYC1030 and PSYC2130. She is an amazing teacher and she knows what she's doing. She also does her best to help her students and goes over the lecture thoroughly. I recommend any of you to have her if you can. :)
5,Definitely one of my favorite classes while I was at Vol State. She made the class very fun to learn in. She is very cool and was very understanding about me having a class at another school. You can't be shy or embarrassed in her class  because she'll use her psychology on you! But if you get the chance to take her  take her. She is really cool.
2,"I had to dance the nutcracker in front of the whole class. If I didn't she was going to take away points!! We had to take selfies with strangers in public! Basically we did a ton of stupid stuff that had no relation to psychology. She said we won't need a book  then test time comes and she says  ""Read your chapters!"" She never taught us anything."
2,I can't say whether Prof Mitchell knows her stuff or not
1.5,Be prepared to teach yourself if you take this class online. Instructor offers no help. She very rarely checks or responds to emails. I was excited at first  to take this class and ended up very disappointed.
5,Ms. Mitchell is awesome! She is so nice and willing to help if needed. She makes her classes interesting and fun. I have taken 3 of her classes and I wish I could take more! The only time I have ever looked forward to going to school is when I was in her class.
4,I felt that she didn't really help us out at all online. We essentially taught ourselves from the textbook. Then on top of that  she would make 25% of the test about things that weren't covered in the textbook. How are we supposed to know these things if we are teaching ourselves.
5,Now she is a awesome teacher!!!!She makes you want to come to class to see what is gonna happen... You learn so much in there and yet you don't feel like your doing anything.. you do need to study for the tests  but she gives a study guide.. Piaget is huge in her teaching so lok him up and know all you can about him. You rock Ms. Mitchell love ya
5,Great Teacher!!
4.5,Miss Mitchell made my semester. I really ought to talk about her knowledgeability and the way she makes the material fun and interesting to the vast majority of disinterested students  but all that pales in comparison to my huge crush on her. Shew. Yeah  she really kills me. I'll leave it at that.
5,Excellent teacher. Treats everyone fair. She doesn't have pets  and she seems to really enjoy teaching.
5,Wonderful teacher! Def the best at Vol State. Very helpful and amazingly nice to everyone
4.5,Shes always willing to explain what shes talking about
5,Mrs. Mitchell is the best instructor at VSCC hands down. She really goes above & beyond to help anyone who needs it!!! Would highly recommend her if you want to have fun & learn at the same time!
5,Amazing teacher.
5,Mrs. Mitchell is such a sweet lady and a great teacher! She is willing to help a student in anyway that she can! A GREAT overall teacher! I wish there were more teachers like her!!!!
5,Mrs Mitchell is wonderful! I can't say enough nice things about her. She is very intelligent and willing to do anything to help a student. I highly recommend her!
5,I love Mrs. Mitchell. She seems so interested in teaching and seems like she loves what she does. She tries to get everyone involved and I think that is great.
5,Very sweet teacher. I like her. Lots of class discussion
5,love her she is the best
5,Had as Video. Gave study guides which made the test very easy to pass. There is a LOT of textbook use in this class. You have to read the text and take really detailed notes on the video or you will not pass. Very nice woman.
4.5,No Comments
5,Not an easy class  but a good one to take. Gave take home tests that were very hard  but manageable. Also had a couple papers to write - not too hard though. Was an overall good professor to take! Would recommend to anyone!
4.5,Very good teacher. Give alot of hoomework. She helps review with test. Good class.
4,I loved Mrs.Dauer!!!!
5,Mrs. Dauer was incredibly nice  funny  and down to Earth. She made class interesting by showing videos and incorporating daily life and the media into our discussions. I would highly recommend her.
4,No Comments
5,Mrs. Dauer is one of the nicest teachers I've ever had! Her class isn't too difficult  we even had a party in class. She's very helpful. I would highly recommend her!
4.5,No Comments
4,She's absolutely wonderful! She can be slightly vague at times  but mostly gets the point across. I like that she is thorough with her marking.
4.5,She is just amazing. Very nice person and great to look at too. I use to attend her class just to see her. had her for media story telling class and it was great fun.
5,Really good teacher
3,She is way too kind hearted and gets taken advantage of. Most people don't sleep in her class because they don't come in the first place. Those that do get to see some decent movies. Overall I liked her even though many thought she was unclear at times.
4,Great teacher. Great person.
1,There is a good amount of homework  although if you read up you'll be fine. She doesn't teach much in class  mostly YouTube videos and she jumps from slide to slide without explaining how they relate to another. TESTS are ridiculously hard and confusing. Half of the content has never been gone over or even mensioned. You're in for a ride.
1,she literally will not teach you anything  if you are a comp sci major  i hope you already know how to use java  if you are taking it for credits don't even think about taking this excuse for a professor. you will fail. If you think you did all the homework right which you probably did  she will still give you 0/30
2,Lecture slides(riddled with spelling/grammar errors) and YouTube channels are 80% of the material covered in class. Unless the students are engaged she tends to move quickly/clumsily. Clearly knowledgeable in the subject but not the clearest on answering questions and a little hostile in answering questions even though she encourages them.
1,tough grader  she expects too much for an introduction class  lots of homework  no extra credit
4,Good instructor. A grading criteria is given for each assignment but does not display how picky she is so be sure to be very precise when assembling your homework folders. Gives detailed feedback. Very caring. Encourages questions. Lectures are slightly confusing but she spends quite some time clarifying things with you if you ask for help.
3,She is a so so teacher. She truly cares about the students. Be prepared to learn the majority of the content on your own. I got an A in this class  she is a very easy grader. The people who said she was a tough grader and gave hard exams  are the ones who did not prepare. This is a tough subject  you need to study.
1,Bar-none the worst professor I've had throughout 3 different institutions. Only take her class if you are already an expert on programming. lectures are vague and unhelpful no study guides but very difficult exams/quizzes nasty attitude broken english grades ruthlessly lots of homework w/ material that's not covered in class
4,She will give many extra credits. I think her logic and lecture is clear if focus on what she said  and no tired of questions. We have to be really careful with homework because of so many details. I learn preciseness and patience from her.
1,I finished her class  and I am very disappointed about her class. I can say that there is nothing  except that reading her confusing lectures  watching videos on YouTube  and doing her tough homeworks. Be careful to read her long assignments because she is a tough grader  and she won't help you at all.
4.5,"Although she is pretty touch for grading but she's nice and really help you to learn the ""truth"" of how programming really is. If you are serious about your career as CS engineer so take her. I like her commitment in teaching. Overall  she's very helpful when you come to her office for help/need."
1,Assigns a ton of homework  said i'd be able to do my work on my mac if i purchased Office365  which didnt come with 12 the required software for class. her lack of knowledge of current computer software and stubbornness caused me a lot of stress  i ended with a 79.1% getting a C  she did not round up even knowing the extra time i put into class
1,HORRIBLE  worst class I have ever taken and she is no help at all! Online for a reason and expects you to come to her office hours for help when you email and show exactly the problem is and just need a better clarification of it all and nothing no help! NOT RECOMMENDED
1,Dont take this class!!!!
4,She's a good teacher overall. If you are not experienced programming  I would recommend you take python before hand or some MOOCs. Otherwise it will be a little bit tough  not because of her teaching style but more so it's the Java language that other students find tough. And this class will prepare you for C++ 1 more so than python.
2,This class is NOT recommended... She expects so much from her students but teaches so little prior to the work you're supposed to do... take the class if you already know how to program but beware! for she takes points off if you don't program the way she does...
1.5,Professor Malaty has a very poor teaching structure. From day one she expects you to know how to write a program  and she get's annoyed when your asking her for help. Only take her class as a last resort!
1,Instructor is very disorganized  often makes spelling/punctuation mistakes  and is easily confused. This doesn't really sound like the proper mindset for teaching programming... and it shows on the first day of class. Only take this class if its required or if you plan to self-study.
1,I never felt the need to write a review about a professor until taking CS 140. Prof. Malaty is quite possibly the worst teacher I've ever experienced. She comes to class unprepared and is annoyed by any question being asked even if it's crucial to the lesson. I got an A after thoroughly reading the book and collaboring w/ other students. STAY AWAY!
2.5,Ignore her lectures  read the book. She is well-meaning but her lectures are abysmal. I got fed up and just resorted to relying on Wikipedia for key terms and concepts. A full semester later and I ended up teaching myself. Very exhausting for people not familiar with programming.
1,Whe it comes to teaching the students  she is all over the place. If you are a beginner  You have to rely solely on the textbook. Not helpfull whatsoever and she seems like she doesn't come prepare to class. She is very forgetful and if you try to follow  you'll relize that you are being misguided unless you catch it or someone else in class does.
5,Medical Literacy was amazing! It got me excited about diverse medical fields. Ramin didn't lecture himself but behind the scenes  organized group of practicing physicians from Weill Cornell medicine. Every session was a case study and explored a field. The session on lung cancer made me quit smoking. So this class extended my life span by 10 years!
2.5,I did not like the lack of organization on the HWs and exams. TAs write the HWs and half of each exam. I was told the class gets harder every year. With 5 minutes left on each prelim  we got 15-30 extra minutes  but no extra time on the final  so don't expect it all the time. Overall  that made me feel a lack of trust. Do well on the final.
2.5,His first time teaching in years. Lectures were not pertinent much and not updated online until right before final. Problem Sets were managed solely by the TAs. Prelims were fine. Grade in class is almost solely based on final  as stated by email afterwards. He's a decent person  but do try to stay away as far as class goes.
1.5,Extremely careless about classes. Lecture notes are updated 1 month later (Those for the finals haven't been updated yet).
5,Ramin is amazing! Extremely interesting lectures. Really knows his stuff. Enthusiastic about the subject. Best CS class I have taken. You really learn a lot about CS rather than just programming.
4.5,Incredible class. Ramin makes intro CS extremely interesting. While other CS100 classes were doing mind-numbing pointless programming assignments  we actually learned useful CS applications and picked up the programming as we went.
5,Ramin is a God. Being taught by a genius like this is a true blessing.
4,Taking 312 with Ramin really kindled my interest in CS. He's a dynamic and lucid lecturer  with a flair for the material. His exams were engaging  the homework was interesting and manageable. I hear good things about machine vision  but can't comment from personal experience.
3.5,Took class Fall 1996. Funny guy. Once asked the students why they took a 9AM lecture. (um  we were freshmen  we had little choice.) Exams and assignments were difficult but fair.
5,312 students should complain about the material  not the teacher. this guy was really great in machine vision- great sense of humor and definitely one of the top 5 lecturers in the cs dept
1,He managed to make lectures confusing even without using PowerPoint.
5,Course textbook: Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Variable names Ford  Arthur and HHGTG were common. Lots of intel references. On a whole  really liked his teaching style. Wierd  geeky humor.
2,Went on personal rants all the time  and didn't really teach us much about the material. Extremely hard to get a hold of  and the grading was a constant mess. I will avoid him in the future.
4.5,Clear  thought-out lectures. Coursework can be demanding  and tedious at times. Has a strange pechant for THHGTTG.
3.5,Given that the material is difficult  Ramin is pretty good at explaining it. He could be better
1.5,Conceited
4,Ramin is a VERY dedicated teacher  he takes the class very seriously  and he's an interesting lecturer. He's not the best teacher ever  but he's damn  damn good.
5,"It was years ago but if anyone sees her tell her Sean ""To know me is to love me"" Evans says hi. She wrote a great play regarding a sniper incident too."
5,I love Bonnie Bedford. I think she's incredible
4,No Comments
1.5,Very full of herself. Not a very good writer  and she plays favorites. Very phony!
5,Classes were great. Papers were hard!! Show up with the plays read and papers done and you will get an A. But she is not going to do the work for you. However  she doesn't read most papers - so do really well for a couple of weeks and then you can slack off  because she judges your first paper.
4.5,She was pretty good. Her class was both fun and easy. i don't see what everyone is complaining about...You're probably stupid if you did not like Bedford.
5,She was the best instrctor of the semester  didn't work all that har and ended up with 3.5  because I missed 6 days
1,Terrible.
4.5,No Comments
4,I dont understand why he is useless. David Martin has specific teaching experience. There are times the class is tough to understand. But he makes you work for it. Giving you quizzes every week in class isn't a big deal it wakes you up. He gives lab homework and his grades assignments hes not like other teachers that dont grade hw.
1,I just feel like he just made his course difficult on purpose . On the first day  he told us that more than 50 % of his students fail so i don't know if its his fault or the students. He gives out quizzes everyday which is fine but what he teaches in class is completely irrelevant to what he gives out just as stated in the comments below.
3,He is a nice guy but his teaching style is really hard to understand.
2,His class was okay. I would recommend lots of studying outside of class because his voice is little monotone so makes you sleepy in class.
1,I'll keep this review simple. DONT TAKE HIMMMM !
1,Worst CIS teacher ever... Seriously he needs to retire or something. He seems like a pretty decent guy but what he teaches is completely irrelevant to what he gives out in his exams. Trust me just take another teacher and get a better grade.
5,CIS 111 in general is a pretty boring. You basically learning the fundamentals of programming so don't look for this class to be extremely fun. Just study hard. Learn these fundamentals and look forward to taking CIS 111b. Trust me. Make sure you take Professor Kendall Martin for 111b. Her teaching style is inspiring and you work on cool stuff.
4,He definitely prepares you for 111b. Make sure you read the book ahead of or after he lectures on this topic. The book definitely explain concepts alot better. Reason why I feel he prepared me was because he tests you on every detail explained in the book which is needed in understanding java so you can program fun stuff in 111b.
1,Awful. Makes a very difficult subject even more difficult. Java isn't the easiest subject in the world to learn--and he makes it even more difficult. Some people are great teachers. Some are great business people. You need to know your strengths. Don't care if he's great in business. Lousy at teaching a difficult subject
4.5,I took him twice. I felt the difficulty of his class was fair  The exams were short answer and multiple choice. The daily quizzes he gives  do help you papare for the exams. His grading criteria is clearly laid out. If you do the homework  you should be able to pass the class with no issuies.
1,Don't take this Professor if you have learning differences. His learning style doesn't work for someone who has learning issues. Labs vary  quizzes are almost daily  which is fine  but he doesn't explain the material in simple terms. He makes things complicated than they need to be... His voice will make you go to sleep. I love compsci 
3.5,Follows the syllabus. You will have a quiz at the beginning of each class based on the current topic. All test and quizzes are open book. Test your knowledge on quizzes to see your proficiency on the topic through tricky questions.
3,Expects you to have basic knowledge before class and have all chapters read. Doesnt waste any class time  and uses all of his time proficiently. He is quite experienced and a knowledgeable programmer although he is not good at teaching.
5,I am not sure this is the right class for Mr. Martin to teach. I felt that most of the class was confused on the overall subject. He DID give his all and was very nice and definitely knew the information just teaching us the information was not clear enough. That may be because of a student who kept disrupting the class.
4,Lots of real world practical experience.
5,Professor Martin covers the material very well and clearly has a passion for it. After the first few classes it becomes obvious that he is a computer veteran with enormous amounts of experience. He provides a great overall learning experience and many examples from his career for the practical reasons behind material covered. Great Professor.
4.5,Prof D. Martin is a absolute gentleman. open book quizs  multiple choice exams  lots of extra credits  lowered bar.. He does everything to help you pass the class. There is one minor thing about him though. Sometimes he spends too much time helping out students who falls behind. some advanced students may find this little boring..
4,Very traditional teacher but more than fair. He gives out a generous amount of extra credit and does everything he can to help you if yon need it. Would recommend.
4.5,This guy was meant to teach computers. He's been in the business for quite some time and knows the way things work. I wanted to take assembler with him put they had to cancel the class. In my opinion  he is the best instructor they have in the CIS department. I've only had 6 of them  but he's best
5,Great Visual Basic instructor. Class was informative and enjoyable. Would take a course from him again.
4,Great guy  always willing to meet and help out. Super funny  made class worth going to. Wish he was still at LU.
4.5,He usually wasn't late by over 1-2 minutes. He is a busy guy  cut him some slack. The tests were fair and if you got the prep work you'd do well. If you're bad at math don't blame him  he was a funny guy yet still taught well. Unlike many math profs  he DIDN'T just copy the book. All the processes were right even if he made a few mistakes with #s.
5,Hes an amazing marker! U cant fail his course
3,Very good sense of humour. Teaching methods did not work well for me  minimal interaction with students. Several of my friends did very well though and enjoyed his lectures. Would prefer a tutorial rather than an extra 30 mins of classtime. Fair tests  but the exam was written by another professor  and was not very related to what what we learned.
1.5,How to describe this prof? He is always late for class there is no tutorial because he uses it to teach  needs help from student when he makes mistakes  tests were rediculously long and the class was never prepared  should not be teaching
2,"what can i say about him! he is annoying when he snaps his fingers or goes ""euuuhhh""..he comes to class disorganized..posts our hwk like 4 days before a test and expect us to do good when we have a million other things to do...although he makes me laugh a lot which is good compared to most teachers"
5,An excellent teacher. He brings a sense of humour to the classroom that is sorely missed. He presents information in a clear manner  and openly encourages the class to participate in the lecture. This interaction is a great bonus. He certainly knows his stuff  and makes it available to all. The class I was dreading to take has become my favourite!
3.5,What can I say about Robidoux? The guy really has no idea what hes doing. He comes to class incredibly disorganized  and wastes our time teaching useless proofs. He actually has to get the students to point out his mistakes  otherwise the stuff he teaches would be completely wrong.
1.5,sometimes you feel like a nut!
4.5,This teacher always has something funny to say. He has an interesting bonus mark system. Only complaint I have is that his tests are VERY long.
1.5,This teacher makes all his tests and exams too long so that everyone fails because they dont have time to finish. And most of the stuff on his test r things he didnt even teach yet in class. He's completely disorganized.
1.5,The guys a lunatic. He's never prepared for teaching his course.
5,Awesome teacher. Always willing to help. He makes the class fun.
1,I don't know about you...but if I can't take notes during lectures  I'm pretty much up the creek without a paddle! We're there to learn  not to fail.
5,I took this class these past 8 weeks in the Fall of 2017 and I thought it was going to consists a lot more work like people were saying. Honestly  I learned a lot from the labs we were assigned and he strongly believes in all students! There is nothing that couldn't be possible in this class. I would highly recommend him to anyone! Thanks again!
5,Awesome course and I am very glad I took it. If you are decided on him and another teacher TAKE HIM. This is a perfect GE course for life science if you are not a science major. There are about 10 quizzes (10 Q's)   1 discussion  1 current event assignment  a midterm (50 Q's) and a final (100 Q's). It sounds like a lot but it really isn't!
4,I hardly used the textbook and still ended up with an A. He sets you up to excel and  for us non-science majors  it is much appreciated. I definitely recommend this professor.
5,Hilarious guy!!!! Must take! This is a GPA booster. I had him as an online class and I was cracking up while reading the study guide! Take him!!
5,He's hilarious man. I enjoyed attending his classes. I highly recommend him for non-bio majors.
5,I highly recommend this online class it is pretty clear and easy A. Do the work and you will get the grade. Prof suggested to get mylab but didn't use it at all. the discussions req. are clear and easy. The prof is understanding and works with you on anything without out double questioning. Awesome Teacher! for being online.
5,Professor Warwick is the best. I took his online course plus the lab and I actually learned a lot. He explains bio in a way (in his lab book) that normal people can comprehend. I HIGHLY recommend him. If you stay up to task you will get an A. He is VERY understanding and you can email him with suggestions/questions. BEST PROF EVER.
5,I took his class a few years ago and I really liked him! He seems like a genuinely nice person and he has a really funny sense of humor. I recommend his class!
5,50% of our grade participation was given by attending class 10% was awarded for doing in-class readings and small projects  in which he would rarely assign! Quizzes are easy  online  and 20% of our grade. Midterm and final are 20% of the grade & are also online tests you take at home. If you can't get an A in this class  you're sad. Lol
5,Professor Warwick is amazing. He is funny and SUPER UNDERSTANDING. One time I got an answer wrong on a quiz and I gave him an explanation as to why I chose that specific answer  and he liked my explanation  and said that he would add that point back on. He is eager to help and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND taking his class. Wish I could take his class again.
3.5,This is a non-major Biology class. This is a free-giveaway course just to boost up your GPA. Just take it and you will get an A. Lots and lots of extra credit.
4,It's up to you if you want to get anything out of the class. It's so easy. Just do the work and you'll get an A. The lab can be harder.
5,Easy class and lab. The lab kit is ridiculously expensive. $60 for a box of basic stuff you can find at home - straw  clothespin  etc. Lab manual is $100  only difference is the lab sheets are different color. Easy A if you just need class for general education requirement.
4,I took both Biology 100 and the Lab. You CANNOT use Used Lab Manual & Kit. You have to buy new each semester because he uses different colored lab sheets. Labs are easy. Be Careful if you search Google for answers because some are wrong. Rent textbook instead to save money. Very Easy class overall but it won't help you if you are science major.
3,Super easy but be ready to sit in class while he rambles about things that have absolutely nothing to do with biology or your lesson.
3.5,I'm an Economics major  so I was a little wary of taking Biology without proper preparation. However  I passed this class with an A  and with flying colors! Would recommend to all my friends.
3,Just take it  trust me!
4,Lectures and important facts in seaport are a must read. The book isn't very well written but you will need it for some of the tests. This Class is straight forward weekly quizzes a midterm with essay and a Final. I highly recommend Professor Warwick I like his straight forward approach.
5,Professor Warwick  is wonderful he grades fairly and he doesn't round your grade at all so don't expect a higher grade. However  I guess my case was different because I had an 89.89% after my final and he just gave me the A even though I didn't expect it :). He is very attentive to his email and will always respond in a timely manner!
5,12 (five question) MC quizzes  12 (SUPER EASY) lab reports  1 (10 question) MC midtermessay portion  1 (10 question) MC finalessay portion. Google MC questions exactly  I found all the answers. I BS'd labs (I don't think he even read them) and got perfects. I finished everything in 2 weeks  got a 99%. I didn't learn anything but hey I got an A+
1,Her teaching is elementary. She literally sat us down during one class and showed us a video of a man showing the process of how a first grader learned to draw a butterfly to a bunch of other first graders. Very rude  doesn't take the time to have conversations with students  and if you question any part of her teaching  she snaps at you.
1.5,"Most uninspiring person at OCAD. She may be well educated but this self dubbed ""dragon woman"" is the least empathetic person I have ever met. Grading did not correspond with ass. guidelines. Tried to ask for feedback as to Y I failed she yelled at me rather than providing constructive criticism. Dropped her class & took it in the summer"
1.5,Her guidelines for assignments don't match how she marks papers. Doesn't have any powerpoint presentations because all she does is talk. WE GO TO AN ART SCHOOL. WE LEARN VISUALLY. HOW DO YOU NOT HAVE VISUALS FOR US?????I wouldn't take her class ever again.
4,She knows the history very well. Overall shes an alright person but at times she comes off as tough  rude and strict. But still her class is helpfull and you will learn alot.
5,jessica is awesome. her course is challenging (in a good way!) but she is reasonable with assignments  does not give you lots of useless exercises. a great lecturer  great ideas  funny  very contemporary. her class was a real pleasure. and yes  she is easy on the eyes.
5,No exaggeration THE BEST professor I have had at the school. She's approachable (friendly) and intelligent  and can explain herself clearly and concisely. You can tell she enjoys what she does and waht she teaches  and teaches you everything you need to know to be critical and smart too! A MUST-HAVE for the school!
4,Great stuff. She really knows her stuff and conveys it enthusiastically and compellingly. Not the easiest of graders  but fair ... easy on the eyes too!
4.5,Her lectures were always well organized and informed. She was an awesome prof to have. You can tell she knows what she is talking about.
5,Greatest teacher that I have had at OCAD! She takes the time to break down the text and explain everything possible in the little time that we have. I hope that she continues to teach  as a loss of her would mean disaster to the course itself.
1.5,she's cute but always teaches the wrong thing   very moody and rude ( sigh)
4,sometimes moves around the place. but is very very smart.... ummm.. shes a sassy prof
5,No Comments
5,Amazing Lecturer  She's an absolute Rock Star up there. She knows what to say and how to say it. If you hate art history as I did get ready to be converted.
5,She's great. Very helpful. Very clear. She won't screw you over
1,His lectures usually have nothing to do with the lesson nor do they relate to the textbook Tests are all or nothing  meaning you either get 25 points in a question or 0 points. One little mistake in code and you lose all points (I wish I was exaggerating). Your best bet is to hope his old tests make sense.
3,The tests are word for word  100% the practice test. They are the exact same thing. Just memorize it. Lectures are boring and he makes a lot of mistakes on the board. You can 100% snooze through lecture  be there for the quizzes  and memorize the practice test and be fine. Very boring.
2,Really bad at grading tests. Questions are usually all-or-nothing  so while it might help you once in a blue moon if you show your work  chances are you won't get any of the points for a question you get wrong anyways.
2.5,Good professor. Lectures are interesting  makes the class fun to attend. Likes giving pop-quizzes  homework is easy points  takes attendance. Harsh grader on exams  be as precise and clear with answers as possible or he wont give credit.
4,Good professor. Not the best teacher  but he keeps the class is plenty entertaining and fairly easy.
3,His analogies are a little off  sure  and he's old  so he likes anecdotes. Also  on tests/quizzes be as PRECISE as possible. He took off for using abbreviations on diagrams that he used  although since he DID explain what they stood for (some might say they were common knowledge for CpE majors) you can't say it's wholly unfounded. Don't cut corners
3,Nutter tells a lot of stories- few of which have a lot to do with the material being covered. Quizzes come from the previous week's notes  and the exams are very similar to the previous semester's exams.
3.5,Although he uses analogies (that don't really make sense) to describe everything  he is still a very straighforward professor. Take notes on class lectures and study those for the quizes. The tests are exactly like the practice tests.
1,He's ridiculous  puts things on tests that he never goes over in class. Tests VERY unfair.. basically by the end of the semester you'll hate him intensely  so just save yourself the trouble and don't take anything he's teaching.
1,Roy Nutter is the most unfair professer i have ever had. He takes off points on some tests and not on others. Avoid him if possible. When i went to him to talk about my test grade he laughed at me and made me even more angrier.
2,Horrible teacher. Avoid at all costs. Puts things on tests that he NEVER goes over in class. Doesn't give much partial credit. Doesn't really seem to have a point when he's teaching. Overall just a crappy teacher.. don't take him unless you absolutely have to.
4.5,The Lectures were very interesting after we got out of assembly language. Tests were somewhat unfair. The class was actually kinda fun to go to.
5,"Great professor.Likes to have ""Quiz time"" at the start of most classes.Most hw deals with topics from previous courses.Tests are really fair.He pretty much tells you what each question will be before hand.I would recommend you take him for any and all classes possible."
5,Great guy. He is not like any other professor because he doesn't stick to a schedule for a course. New topics are made day to day and the material is broad (Does anyone ever remember details learned during a course a year later? NO!!). Learned a lot in his courses which help me life.
4.5,Tests are pretty much identical to practice tests. He is somewhat forgetful and sometimes talks about off topic things for the whole class. Overall  I enjoyed his classes and would def. take him again.
3.5,He kind of floats around. Likes attendance sheets and is overall pretty interesting. He goes kind of slow  so you can get bogged down in material. Just work the crossword or something to fill the time.
5,If you go to class and study the practice test  you will be fine. HE is very straightforward about what will be on the tests. ANyone who got less that an A in his class shuld be ashamed of themselves.
2.5,Dr. Nutter was my advisor on my senior project. He was not very helpful and not very clear. He is a fairly nice person  though.
5,Awesome!

5,Pretty laid back
4.5,Dr. Kurtz is a transformational educator. Very rarely do students have an opportunity to learn from a teacher such as him. He does not parent you  but he expects a mature student to be prepared and engaged each day. He is wicked smart. He is hilarious  in his own awkward  offbeat way. He cares a lot about what he does and it shows. Simply great
4,I loved Kurtz. He is actually the best professor I have had in my total education career. His passion for teaching makes you want to be in class. He writes comments on papers that are hard to read but he is pretty clear in his office hours and class time about what is expected. He is an amazing professor and you have to take a class with him.
4.5,He's passionate about teaching  willing to help  and he cares about students and Denison as a community. Some might call him unclear  but that's just the nature of his class. He's there to make you think and help you make connections. If you understand his off-beat sense of humor  you'll realize he's actually a hilarious guy. Highly recommended.
4.5,Dr. Kurtz is an amazing professor. He is passionate about his classes and his students. The content is difficult but he is always willing to help and fair.
1.5,Really obscure  he is unclear and not a very good teacher- he sort of throws out big words and hopes that they sound intelligent  but secretly he's not very smart. Easy if you like pandering to his desire for run of the mill phrases and simplistic insights. All the books are redundant and similar. Good luck.
4.5,This guy is crazy  and I mean that in the best way possible. He's very intelligent  almost awkwardly so  and has a really out-there way of lecturing. He's very random too
4,Very nice guy  def. a little to smart for his own good  but never had a prof so willing to help! TONS OF reading  but it is intresting  def. a class that you couldn't fall asleep in!
3,very nice guy  but also very awkward. seems almost too smart for his own good. for being big on public speaking and whatnot he's not too good with the whole social skills stuff himself. not too hard though  and can be fairly interesting at time.
4.5,If he is still teaching his 'Rhetoric of the Civil Rights Movement' please take it. One of the best classes Denison has to offer.
5,I took Dr. Kurtz's civil rights rhetoric course a few years ago  and I am still recommending some of his course texts. Class was always eventful and challenging and focused in a weird fun sort of way. He is also invested in his students  and fully encouraging.
4.5,Public Speaking: Very easy. He's helpful and clear. One tip: Don't pick controversial subjects for speeches.
4.5,Very helpful. Also very intelligent.
3.5,Be prepared to work
5,Dr. G is a fun professor who loves sociology and helping students learn to love it as well. He really cares about his job and it shows. I would 100% recommend taking him if you have the chance. We had 3 exams  all online and pretty easy if you do the readings and go to class.
4,Dr. G is fantastic. He makes you feel validated and respected as a student. He never talks down to anyone. He keeps his lecturing as interesting as possible (it's still theory) and tries to engage students in the discussion. You can tell he puts his heart into his work and really wants to connect with the students. Take him!
4,Dr. G is hilarious! He likes to tell personal stories which helps you remember the material. The lectures can get long and boring  but that's because the class is an hour and a half. There are only three exams total  all of which are online. There are also two projects. The only downfall to this is that you can't lose more than 13 points for an A
5,Although the lectures get long  I found the content boring rather than the professor. I loved having him
4,I find that the lectures get boring  but Gongaware is hilarious. You have 3 exams  which are all online and 2 projects which are pretty easy. He's not a hard grader and I never read the book but do well on the tests. Would recommend if you're looking for a class to fulfill gen eds.
5,Dr. G is the man! I took this course online over J-term  but he was still very helpful. Read the instructions and do exactly what he is asking for  and it is an easy A.
5,Professor Gongaware is a cool professor. He's really funny and will always listen to you. Although the course starts out rough  you'll definitely get the flow of it.
4.5,Dr. G does an excellent job of making students feel validated and important to lectures. Allowed lecture to get derailed from time to time simply because we had a strong interest in a topic and he enjoyed seeing us work with the material. Great use of examples and doesn't ask you for too much. You get out what you put into this class.
4,Great teacher when it comes to keeping lectures interesting and engaging. If you have questions he is easily approachable and will do his best to answer the question
5,Take his SOC 110 class! I loved going to his classes. Most days he told stories that made this class great.
3.5,There is three exams  all online  and two one page single spaced papers. I didn't read the book once or any of the assigned readings and did just fine. You do need to study for the exams  but if you take notes you should be fine. He can get sidetracked and sometimes the lectures aren't that engaging.
3.5,Dr. Gongaware was a very good professor. His tests are all online and only two one page papers. Lectures can get long and boring but some of the material is interesting. Just do the review guides and you'll be fine.
5,A fantastic professor. I wasn't looking forward to SOC theory at all and with Dr. G it quickly became my favorite class of the semester. He is passionate Sociology and wants to see his students succeed. He treats you like adults and gives it to you straight. Great guy. Would take him again and recommend him without a doubt.
3.5,Not hard. What you are supposed to do for projects may seem difficult  but as long as you just cover exactly what it says in the directions  you'll get 100% on them. Tests are online  recommend reading the chapter only before test  do not need to otherwise. Super approachable and very understanding! Class can be boring  but worth going! TAKE HIM!
2.5,He was a nice guy  but not my favorite professor. His tests were online  but I never felt like I had enough time. His expectations on assignments were unclear  which made it difficult to get an A.
3,This class isn't too bad. His tests can be a bit tricky  but they are all online which is nice. I would not recommend procrastinating on the projects  they are not hard but they can be time consuming. He tends to go off on weird tangents so sometimes we only get through 2 slides in class  but overall he is fairly entertaining  I'd recommend him :)
3.5,Dr. G is a very funny and approachable guy. He is interesting in his lecture but it is very hard to follow what he is saying sometimes. He is kind of scattered in his lecture and it is hard to remember everything from lecture. Sometimes you find the book more interesting than his lectures.
3.5,Dr. Gongaware is a really nice and funny guy! Swears a lot which can be entertaining. However  his lectures drag on FOREVER and seem scatterbrained at times. No offense to him  but I learned more from reading the textbook than listening in class. I found him hard to pay attention to a lot of the time and he can be unclear about assignments.
5,awesome guy! very easy to listen to. drops quite a few 'f bombs' which always spices the discussion up. tests are online and papers aren't bad. take him if you can!
4.5,He was so awesome and funny. He really opened my eyes to sociology and how incredibly interesting it is. He has an awesome sense of humor and is a very real guy. He class is really easy and he never takes attendance. Definitely take him for SOC!
5,I thoroughly enjoyed Dr. Evergates. While gentle of voice and speech  he packs a punch! Very entertaining  very informative. Loved the narrative style of his lecturing! Speaking as a non-traditional student  I think he is one of the most respectful and decent professors on campus.
4.5,"I had Dr. Evergates for ""Senior Seminar"". Simply put this man is excellent. He is so knowledgeable in his field and others  is always willing to help  and took our papers and made them into something amazing. He is one of the best the college has."
3,Very nice mean who is an easy grader if you do your work. Probably easiest seminar class except for Qin's class. Sometimes hard to hear and can be boring.
4.5,Amazing professor. He's really soft spoken so he's hard to hear at times but he is extremely knowledgeable and is always willing to help. He re sparked an old interest for me.
4,Nice Guy. Hard to Hear. Will help if you need it.
4.5,Really intelligent and soft-spoken. Always wants the best for his students and tries very hard to accomodate.
3,If you pay attention  his class is really easy. especially quizzes. in lecture he gives u vocab  gives the def. and then on the quiz/test  asks for 3 or 6 specific ones. and he only wants 4 or 5 sent.
4.5,good teacher  kinda boring at times  but nice guy
4,Sit in front to hear him
4,speaks very softly
5,I took several of Mitchell Snays courses in 2011 and 2012  and still remember many of his lectures. Hands down the best teacher I had in my life. Challenging and passionate  he made my love of history endure.
4.5,He's a hard grader (I got a B-) yet one of the best professors I have ever studied with at Denison. Expect to read a lot  but the workload is still manageable. His lectures were really good and enjoyable (provided you read the textbooks).
3,he's a hard grader and ok teacher
4.5,I love Dr. Snay  and his class is great! My only complaint is that his assessments are incredibly picky. Most of the stuff you need to know will be one-liners from the book that you would probably not give a second glance to  so be super careful. He loves history and teaching but I think he forgets that not all of us can be walking encyclopedias.
5,Love him!
5,Favorite teacher at Denison! He is so passionate and the class goes by so fast. While he expects a lot  he makes you want to do well. Definitely take him if you have the option.
4.5,He LOVES history. His passion makes you pay attention in class. I find that he assigns way to much reading. We use three textbooks on a regular basis and will read a chapter from each throughout the week. He expects you to do your work and all of your work so if you don't tests will be a challenge. Work is managable. Really helpful.
5,Incredibly challenging  very passionate  and expects a great deal from his students. Not coincidentally  he is one of the best teachers I've ever met.
5,"Favorite teacher on campus. Challenging but fair. His high opinion is motivating to do your best work. By far the best class I've taken at Denison was ""Antislavery"" 290. Really intelligent  approachable  helpful. Had us to his house for dinner. LOVE MITCH."
4.5,Prof. Snay is a very good teacher  reading is managable  but he is a hard grader.
4.5,Great prof. Very hard  but definitly makes the material seem more interesting
4.5,Best professor on campus!
5,One of the best profs. Really expects a lot out of the students and is stingy on grading  but you will come out of the class feeling as if you really learned something.
5,AWESOME PROF!! Class is difficult  but he is so willing to help out!! He has a lot of respect for the students  as long as you do the work. One of my fave profs on campus.
5,It's not easy but it's a great class  and he's an awesome and genuine professor.
5,OMG!!! Simply the most amazing person I have ever met in my life!!! I truly love Dr. Wise!! I wish he would have waited until I graduated to leave though :-( So very talented. OMG i am so at a loss for words...
5,One of the most amazing people I've evert met. So ENTHUSIASTIC about what he is teaching and loves/knows his stuff. Look forward to Gospel Choir every Wednesday  can't beleive we actually get credit for this class...I would take it no matter what!
5,this guy knows so much and he cant wait to tell you about it. hes very enthusiastic and so friendly its impossible not to like him!

5,Dr. Wise is one of the most talented composers/directors in Gospel Music today. His energy and charisma  and musical gifts are incomparable. He is an excellent teacher and leader who always takes the time to help his students however he can.

5,incredible  incredible  incredible. most talented  energetic  fun-loving  and inspiring men I've ever met.
5,African American Music History--Dr. Wise is amazing! one of the nicest  entergetic  talented and dedicated people on this campus! Awesome :)
5,Dr. Jasken is one of my favorite professors at McDaniel. She definitely cares about her students & wants them to succeed. She expects a lot as far as class work goes  but it's work that is worthwhile & can be applied in the real world--not just silly reading assignments here and there. I wish I could've taken more classes with her. She's great!
5,Jasken is  by far  one of my favorite professors at McDaniel. She's is a great teacher  is fun  engaging  and understanding. I never felt that class was a waste of time and the class material was relevant and applicable. I would highly recommend taking a class with her--especially the Editing and Desktop Publishing class!
5,Dr. Jasken is my all-time fave professor at McDaniel. She treats her students with respect and is always willing to help you learn. I have taken many classes with her  and everyone just loves her. She is WONDERFUL!!
5,Dr. Jasken was very nice and helpful  but the class was pretty difficult. Since the class was required  I definitely recommend her as the teacher.
3,Jasken's very nice  engaging  etc.  but her class activities are a little too...squishy...to be relevant to the subject matter. I don't know why this was a 3000-lvl class. Also  it's teaching outdated technology -- not entirely Jasken's fault  but she clearly wasn't up on current standards.
5,She is Awesome...this is truly one of the only classes I have enjoyed. The class and assignments are engaging and as challenging as you want them to be. I found her to be very helpful  I was not familiar w/ a lot of the computer programs & she was always there to help  she is also very talented.
5,Shes helpful and fun. But I wouldnt take the class again.
1.5,"Started out easy then turned on full blast! So not a good class!! Teaches like you are in 1st grade. Helps only certain ""english Major"" students. Avoid this class!!!!"
5,Jasken's a little too easy. She's more of a high school teacher and not like a college professor but I guess that's what you should expect from an english 1101 class.

4,Ive never met anyone who UNDERSTANDS acting the way Elizabeth does. She just KNOWS how to make you better at public speaking  acting-related stuff in particular. I really like her emphasis on differentiating between actor and script. She made me feel welcome among a bunch of hostile theater majors even though I was not as talented/important.
5,She's a prof. actress and teaches acting! Hello people...if you aren't a theatre major/minor then don't take her courses! If you ARE then you must take her courses you will get great value from her knowledge and experience! She tells you from the beginning that this is NOT easy and it isn't. This is serious work and EVDB is a great teacher!
5,EVDeebs! She's incredible. She has scared people out of theatre before but she just wants to make sure you  the student  really want to train and really want to get better as an actor. She is wonderful and I love getting a beer with her. Great teacher!
3.5,She is an extremely hard grader. She gives out the syllabus at the beginning of the semester and sticks to it pretty well. She doesn't remind you when things are due  just expects you to know. Her classes are fun and interesting if you like acting and theatre. Don't take her class if you are not a serious actor.
1.5,A professor who obviously loves her craft but shouldn't necessarily be teaching it to others.
2.5,Elizabeth takes every person as a serious actor who wishes to pursue this as a life goal. Also is very unorganized with homework. Little to no warning about work. Only a class/teacher to take if you are in love with acting and plan on being an acting based theater major.
4.5,Challenging  insightful comments that help you to grow as an actor. Can be a bit wacky at times  but it's not really a bad thing (you're in an acting class  after all). Do NOT complain about warm ups.
4,I haven't had her as a teacher yet  but she is my director for the fall play and she is fantastic!!
4,she's a great teacher and she really gets inside of your head...i loved the class
4.5,Great class! Expect to work you ass off though! One of the only class you prob wont fall asleep in  she has a lot of energy. DONT BRING YOUR CELL! But great class!
5,I love Elizabeth. Her lectures are so interesting  she keeps you on her toes. She expects your best but is understanding when you can only give her less than your best. You should def. take this class  it is awesome!!!
1.5,A lot of work for the class. Do not recommend if you're not a THE student already.
1.5,Who ARE you people? This broad is crazy  biased  and drives people away from theatre
5,whoa! hard work  but really interesting and FUN!!! Makes HU BLAR interesting  and I got to know people in this class really well. Good for both actors and non-actors...(i'm a non)...since I learned about myself as well. Thanks  Elizabeth!
5,Elizabeth one of the best professors on this campus. I highly reccomend her freshman seminar course! Acting with her will teach you a lot about yourself. she knows lots about you from the first moment you walk in... stay on top of all of your work if you don't it will bite you in the butt later.

4.5,Uber fun class  Elizabeth is great  really crazy and great. Great class to take even if never tried acting before. Variety of work assignments.
4,Didn't know anything about theatre before this class. Easy  no acting. Fun. Learned alot. Work but easy. Highly recomend for a global perspective :)
3.5,Wacky lady. A lot of work for a 1000 level class
4,awesome teacher. One of the funniest teachers I've ever had. Assigns a lot of reading  but not an overwhelming amount. Definately try to take her class.
2.5,The good news: Wendy is smart and witty. The bad news: She knows it. At first you laugh along with her  and then you realize how condescending she's being. She has no respect for RISD and insults it all the time.
2.5,No Comments
5,Wendy is one of the vew professors at RISD who is confidently at the top of her field and whose work and teaching are maintaining the school's much-hyped and currently somewhat fragile reputation.
4.5,Wendy is awesome  everyone should take a class with Wendy Walters she will change your life.
5,her classes are hard but she is very helpfull and you will learn a lot. she is a brillant teacher. i found my favorite author via her advice
3.5,Wendy really got me inspired  I took the poetry class not expecting much - thinking ot just blow off another 3 credits - and I ended up loving poetry  loving the work I produced for her and how it improved... and having a bit of a crush on her. She is sh
4.5,difficult readings  alot of discussion  has alot of sense of humor  is willing to help and laugh with you in all situations and all problems. I love Wendy! she's awesome! a great teacher!
2.5,She was very strict when it came to class attendance. She made us write a lot of papers. The course material was not interesting. We read long uninteresting articles rather than novels. The articles were in depth and complex. She'll make you work hard  but isn't that hard a grader.
4,She's funny as no other  but the feedback from her is negative. She has lots of things to teach  but she force feeds it down the throut in an unpleasant manner  exept when she relates the subject to mama's food
3,Every conversation turned into some kindof race speech about how the african americans suffered. Got pretty annoying- and i dont think I learned very much. She is nice  but  eh?
4.5,was one of my friendliest teachers  and I learned a lot
1,This professor doesn't teach how to use materials. I recommend watching youtube videos to master materials because one will not learn technique from the professor. She gives a lot of pointless lectures too. Class time is not used well and can be boring. She is very spacy  but has a kind and enjoyable personality. A good TA saves the day.
1,Terrible.
3.5,I really enjoyed the assignments and the semester's structure. Deb's very spacey
2,Assignments = great. Teacher = not so great. Always spaced out  absent-minded  and very vague. Breaks students' project a lot. Never let her touch ur project!! Her assignments are interesting to do  but she won't give u any critical/useful advice. (Very ID-oriented class which I didn't enjoy that much)
5,Deb is awesome!! Her projects were really tough but she inspired me to forge ahead and I changed my major from Painting to ID mostly because of her. She is patient and easy to talk to and ALWAYS has time for students on an individal basis. If you get her  you are lucky!
4,Deb was great! She gave us fun assignments and was always enthusiastic. Sometimes her expectations were not always clear. But she knows when effort is put into a project and she takes note of it. The final Project was a blast too. Just remember to make the pojects your own.
3,Pretty good assignments  the course is laid out well. Crits are kind of unhelpful and sometimes don't make sense. She is extremely nice  however  and is very lenient with project restrictions/requirements/materials. Definitely a good introduction to 3D. Have fun  it's hard to go wrong if you put time and thought into your work.
4,Very sweet  a little absent minded sometimes but to a minimal degree without too much interference to her teaching. Her critiques were nice because she could usually point out a projects merits but balance it with constructive criticism. You'll enjoy her class if you enjoy a lot creative freedom.
2.5,"She gives you a grade based on your effort. Craftsmanship is first  then design  and materials play some part too  which is bad for you because the cost of materials link to the ""quality"". She buys some supplies so if you're frugal you can get away with spending < $50. She tries to help and talks a lot  with demos  but it ends up boring students."
2.5,I have very few words to describe Deb. You have to have a class with her to know her degree of spaciness. Some of us wonder whether she came to class stoned... I tried my hardest and did well  but I'm not sure what I learned in the class. The sleds were very fun to make though.
1.5,Her assignments were lame and she barely held our interest. Also  she got highly frustrated if any of us tried to enjoy being in studio for eight hours. The sled project was tons of fun  but she just threw it at us without any introduction to woodworking and expected us to make fine quality sleds.
4,I enjoyed this class  even though 3-D is not my forte. We had some fun projects ( teapots  egg beating project  sled.) She's very helpful  if you ask for it... but she's not going to hold your hand the whole way through. If you aren't satisfied with a project  ust tell her and show her how hard you worked and she'll take that into consideration.
2.5,Deb is just flaky  more so than other teachers. She likes poetic explanations but mostly her own  and it is tough to convince her of other ideas. One day we had a tea party for the entire morning. However  she actually does pay attention to the level of craftsmanship and will reward effort more than you think  gets REALLY pissed when kids slack off
2,just don't even think about how much money you spend to sit in ONE 3D class  or you won't make it through.r r she's nice  semi-interesting projects  but she is hard to read and doesn't give much helpful feedback. Overall...not so good.
1,I try not to think about her...I yelled at her a couple of times and she wrote that I have anger-managment issues. People that know me know it isn't true  but in her class..
2,Deb's not a very good teacher  but I enjoyed her assignments  at least. Use the assignments as opportunities to push yourself  show good craftmanship  and you should enjoy the class and do well.
1.5,communication is not her forte...so don't be surprised if when you get your comment sheet back after the semester is over that she mentiona things that are completely new to you
2.5,blah. this girl doesn't say a damn thing. just nods yes or no. her assignments can be really friggin coool though. but you won't retain anything from her - only from working yourself.
1.5,extremely boring projects  not very knowlegeable  doesn't give much feedback or says it's fine and then grades tough. seems to like more traditional things.
1,she doesnt know what shes doing
1,unless you are going into a class that she teaches knowing all the material like you have your PHD in the subject  expect to struggle. lots of grades which is helpful  but grading isn't based on right/wrong. its what she wants to answer to be in her opinion. TA is just like her  very rude and makes you feel dumb.
2,I am currently in her class. She is not helpful  is impatient with questions  arrogant and basically expects you to know SPSS  Z-scores  T-Test prior to being in her class. She does not go over new concepts  her homework is very hard  no time on class to go over it and balks at questions. Two words. EXTRA CREDIT. She is arrogant and rude.
3.5,She isn't a bad professor but definitely give A LOT of work
1,Dr. Jackson had an extremely arrogant attitude and when asked questions would snap. She was not helpful at all and would make snide remarks that made you think twice before even asking a question. Do whatever you can to avoid this lady.
2.5,Was helpful during class in office hours was snippy and rude makes you feel bad for asking lots of assignments at one time and takes a while to get grades back
3,Love Dr. Jackson  if you need to take 301  take it with her! GREAT TEACHER!
1.5,Jackson is the most convoluted teacher I have experienced thus far. She contradicts the book and herself on a regular basis. Her instructions are never clear. When you ask for help she is snide and rude. Not the MOST difficult material  but she makes it unbearable. She also is never timely on grades.
1.5,Dr. Jackson means well  but this is the most annoying class I have taken at RU thus far. We are constantly using SPSS  and unless you are fortunate and have it on your own personal computer  you will spend a lot of time on campus using those computers for homework. The lab section of this class is just a study block essentially. Avoid if possible
5,The material for the class is hard  but Dr. Jackson is super helpful and knowledgeable. She does everything in her power to help you out. Would definitely recommend her!
1,Dr. Jackson had an extremely arrogant attitude and when asked questions would snap. She was not helpful at all and would make snide remarks that made you think twice before even asking a question. Do whatever you can to avoid this lady.
5,Hard class  but Dr. Jackson is always willing to help out if needed. Extremely clear. Offers plenty of extra credit. Attendance is not mandatory  but you can receive up to 7 extra points on tests just for going to class. Nice lady. Would definitely recommend.
4.5,most influential professor teaching research! she makes you try in order to pass her class and by doing that you gain so much knowledge! Definitely take her if you wish to pursue a career dealing with psychological research. Love her!!!
4.5,(continued from below) but points are given for each day. I failed this class with another teacher  and ended up with a 98% with Dr. Jackson. TAKE HER FOR PSYC201 AND 202. So easy and VERY helpful!! Gives lots of extra credit!
4.5,Dr. Jacksons 201 class is so simple. Everything  and I mean EVERYTHING on tests/homeworks come straight from lecture notes. 4 tests  but the first 2 are part online and part essay  and the essays she gives you to study before the exams. The other 2 exams are part take home and part essay as well and so simple. Attendance not mandatory  but points a
4,Class turned out to be way better than I expected. There were tough assignments/papers but she is such a nice lady and is ALWAYS willing to help out students. I am definitely taking her again for Psyc 202!
1,This is the WORST class I have ever had in my life! Made me cry  never want to return to school  etc.! If you feel like wanting to hang yourself by the middle of the year then by all means  sign up for this course!
1.5,She is the worst professor I have ever had. Period. Avoid this woman at all costs  take Dr. Willner.
3.5,No Comments
1,"She is very unorganized  forgets what she is teaching sometimes & looks confused. I really dont like her teaching style  because she doenst ""teach"". She expects a whole lot  that is expected. a 200-level class she is out of her mind. she really shouldn't be a teacher  she is nice  but doesnt teach well at all. dont take her!!!"
1.5,She was probably the worst Psych teacher I ever had. I had signed up for someone else but she wound up teaching instead. I almost failed that class  and my last 2 years of school I only made like 1 C in all my classes..She SUCKS!
3.5,I really liked this class. I thought the class got easier as it went on. He goes over exactly whats going to be on the test the class before. Also he randomly takes attendance for extra credit and it can really help your grade (20 points). The paper is extremely easy. Definitely reccomend
4,Mr. McGee is so straightforward. He gives you all the notes beforehand. You barely have to write anything down. I never went  but studied for every test and I got an A in the class. The book project is kind of tedious  but not bad once you consider. A great professor  but whatever you do don't take this class at 8 a.m.--you will fall asleep/not go.
4,class is really boring.. but hes nice. he gives a study guide for tests and theyre just like the test. i never went to class.. just studied the study guide and went on review days. got an A. taking him again this semester.
5,Awesome teacher. Had him for a couple of classes. Really good teacher.
1,horrible teacher. He uses his personal opinion over the text information on tests. Don't buy the book you won't need it. attendance isnt mandatory so don't bother going. He's rude and has a very negative outlook on life. The very first day of class he let us know that 50% of us would be divorced! He's just ruuude!
4.5,He's a nice guy. The class was very boring and made sure to keep us to the last second. He does a review the class before each test. Just take notes that class and study them and you'll do fine on the tests.
4,Class is pretty easy. Gives extra credit when he takes attendance. Lectures are decent.
2,Easy teacher  but don't expect to really get anything out of the class. He could make jokes  but I found him to be disorganized and arrogant. Don't ask to see him after class...he complains constantly about how he has no time.
2.5,Very easy class  he e-mails all the notes and the tests are all multiple choice. He doesn't make class very interesting  but it is an easy A.
5,Great guy! Very disorganized at times  but his humor tries to make up for it. Gives GREAT study reviews for exams. Highly recommended.
4.5,VERY EASY!!! I never went to class and i made an A..He e-mails the notes and reviews to you  so you never have to go to class...Tests are straight from the notes..
5,best teache i had at ru
4.5,Slack! Tests are 50 question  multiple choice. The notes are emailed  and all you have to do is take a few notes on what he says here and there  like stories or examples. He's cool. Easy A.
5,I really enjoyed this class. He is a great professor  should teach more classes. Emails notes and gives an awsome test review. Makes class interesting and fun. I really like him and would def. recommend him to anyone!
3.5,he's a good professor and makes note taking really easy cuz he emails all the notes. all u have 2 do in class is listen and 4 the tests  use the website he gives cuz the questions come straight from there. go 2 class every friday cuz he takes attendance.
5,He is so awesome!! Funny and cute!! Explains all the course material!! Very interesting...
3,Test was pretty easy.Go everyday bc he takes attendance randomly and gives you extra credit. The class before the test he gives you a review..write these things down  they're pretty much word for word from the exam.For the paper  go to him and get your article cleared in advance and you will be ok
3,Hexe2x80x99s an ok professor. Tests are ridiculously easy. Class was really boring to sit through (he just reads the notes). Attendance is extra credit. You have to write a paper  but he gives an example paper  itxe2x80x99s easy. He is incredibly patronizing at times. Makes you feel stupid for asking questions.
5,LOVE Mr. McGee! One of the best professors i've ever had. An extremely nice guy  makes class fun  knows his material  will never turn you down for help  etc. I've had him for 2 classes and i've done well in both. A great professor overall.
4,My favorite class and professor at RU so far. He adds humor to his lectures to make it interesting. Majority of the test info is from the notes but some from the book. Gives extra credit for attendance on random days  so just go to class-it helps a lot!
2,Really hard class. It takes a gifted teacher to make macro interesting. Tony is not one of these gifted teachers
1,Economics is a tough field for me  and I really struggled in this class. I met with him during office hours and he wasn't able to offer me any advice. I spent $200 on a tutor and I still didn't do well -- I got a C+ which I consider bad for the amount of work I put into the class. He also made a mistake and recorded my grade as an F  and I had to go through tons of paperwork to get it changed. Avoid this teacher.
5,Caporale is a good teacher  and he is very clear on what he wants from you. He makes sure he explains things thoroughly and is very helpful. His tests are HARD. If you aren't a good studier  don't take this class.
1.5,He's really enthusiastic about economics but i found that what he taught didn't really reflect what was on the midterms. Reading the book is all that really matters because when it came to the tests  my notes were pretty much useless.
4.5,Tony is such a cute professor! He sort of reminds me of a turtle  but I don't want to diss him because he's really enthusiastic about economics. I don't think econ is very interesting  but his lectures go really fast and usually get out early. I still don't like econ a lot  but I'm glad he was my professor. He also gives extra credit assignments!
3,"Oh brother  I can see this guy being like Tony Montana at home. He explains everything clearly  but the tests are pretty difficult for someone who doesn't really ""get"" economics  but I rarely paid attention in class. Use the textbook  listen in class and take notes  and I bet this class wouldn't be too hard."
2.5,he's a cute little dude  and he's crazy about economics. the first test was really easy but the last few got pretty difficult. i felt like the notes didn't really relate to the exams but he does offer some helpful pre-exams on line.
3,Very enthusiastic about the topic. Go to class as much as you can and you will do fine
2.5,Enthusiastic about the material  and a fairly nice guy  but the tests are much tougher than the class suggests  and the in-class notes don't help much. The notes are basically nothing but graphs  and he'll just breeze through the details you need to know. You'll need to read the book to do well.
3.5,Not an easy class  but if you go everyday and take notes then you will do just fine. Caporale is excited about the subject  but he doesn't really make it any more interesting for the students.
3.5,his econ 104 class was easy as pie. i never went and got an A. his economics of sports class is pretty easy. i never went and got an A-.
1,Caporale is an absolute jerk. DO not take his class bc he cant teach the material at all. If you ask for help then he is rude to you. the tests suck and I had to teach myself the whole class.
2,i rarely went to class and still got a B... im not even good at econ. the times i did go it was very boring and hard to pay attention. 3 exams and 1 final make up the final grade  and all exams are multiple choice. i would suggest taking the online quizzes  most exam questions are very simalar to the online quizzes.
1,I had a lot of trouble learning the material in the class b/c I had to teach myself. That's just not the kind of professor I like. His tests are pretty hard too- but if you never go to class read the book understand completely  and do well on the test...go for it  he's your guy.
1,Does not teach! You have to learn everything by yourself  the tests are impossible  has no control over the class  people just leave and come the whole class  it's so annoying. Not very clear in explaining concepts  all he does is draw graphs and expects you to understand them.
3,Talks very fast and teaches right off of the powerpoints from the book's website. If you read the powerpoints and do practice problems from the book  you should be okay. So if you don't like going to class but like getting good/okay grades  this is the class to take
4,Dr. Caporale gives interesting lectures  but as far as material and tests are concerned  the book is a very helpful resource. Studying is essential for the multiple choice exams which can be difficult.
2.5,Read from book. Most of this class could be articulated as effectively through independent study. After the first test I stopped attending class  I recieved an A overall. Felt like a waste of money.
3,Tests are difficult. study. a lot. They're multiple choice format. As for the class  a bit boring. As for the teacher  also a bit boring. not a great class but not horrible
5,Taught in a big lecture hall and he talks kinda fast so you cant really zone out  but no homework and he did lots of practice problems to make things simple. Really animated.
5,He's great. Nice lectures alongside films related to the class. Take home midterm and final with some hw assignments inbetween. He won't make your semester a living hell and you'll learn a lot from his lectures and just speaking to him in general.
3,Straightforward  clear  provides good lectures alongside films relating to the subject matter. Show up to class  sign in  listen and learn. NO tests  NO homework. Take home midterm and final papers as well as attendance your grade for this class. Pezzolo is pure class.
4.5,Hot professor  went to Yale and he is a lawyer. Would definitely take and yes even if he talks that kean is the worst  it is true
1.5,If you want an easy A than take him. Nothing has anything to do with the course that he goes over. All he does is throw temper tantrums about how Kean sucks and we watch movies ALL the time. Show up to class  do other homework  he does not care.
1,All he does is talk about how much he hates the administration
3.5,I am being very honest and speak with concern. He is showing symptoms of senility. He forgets things he has said 10-20 minutes ago. 30 kids show up and 25 leave within the first hour. Last week it was just me and 1 other dude in class left at the end of the lecture. I don't leave because I genuinely feel bad and surprised that he doesn't notice.
2,he put question marks all over my midterm paper do not need the book final was so hard attendance counts walk in and leave he lectures for to long
5,Easy A!! Take home midterm and final  easy essay question you can just google!
1,take someone else. if possible. hes confused. ididnt gt him. hard to understand
4,"Good professor  knows what he's talking about. He'll make you think deeper into the subject  if you actually come to class. Attendance was never mandatory. He specifically says ""Show up to class regularly"". So  half the semester is enough. Come in  sign in  leave. Just do the 2 papers  make sure you answer all of the questions  you'll pass."
2,First time with this professor and I thought he was easy. Technically you can miss class 10 times. (10pts for attendance.) Participation isn't much  just a midterm and final  watch a lot of movies in class. Complains about Kean a lot. Easy A...
5,"I had Dr. Pezzelo for Justice and Human Rights. He is amazing  great guy he cares about his students. Take home midterm and final essays really easy.Very interesting class you like hist. and politics.You watch movies and discussions after. Got an ""A"" Great class!!!"
3.5,Honestly I took this course because it was easy  but I was also hoping to learn something too. Don't get me wrong you do learn basic concepts such as being honest and how humans take things for granted  but what im criticizing is the way he teaches it is frustrating. All he does is complain about people and Kean. Complains but gives no solutions.
5,He is so intelligent and his lectures are very interesting. All classes should be like his  where you actually leave the class with knowledge about the topic and a different way of thinking.
4,He is very intellgent and passionate. Sometimes he rambles but that is only because he really loves what he teaches. I enjoyed this class  wasn't alot of work and it really made me THINK!! That's what school should be about  no? Never a dull moment with this guy
4.5,Very easy class. He takes attendance but claims it does not factor into grade. Only 2  that's right 2 assignments in the entire class. A take-home midterm and take-home final. Only a few pages of writing required. He generally lets the class out early as well. Very nice and easy to talk to. A great choice for a free elective. EASY A.
4.5,The textbooks that he says you need are NOT a requirement  don't buy or rent them. You can Google a lot of the info. or use library resources. Teaching-wise  he's very passionate and kind. Pretty funny too and a little eccentric  which is always interesting. The class is VERY easy... movies every class. He's really chill and intelligent. Easy A!
4.5,I had Pro Pezzelo for Justice and Human Rights. He is amazing  great guy who cares about his students. Take home midterm and final which is really easy if you take notes and utilize his office hours. Come to class sign in and leave whenever you want  attendance is mandatory. He shows alot of movies. I'm taking him for two classes next semester!
5,great class must take professor really good at explaining the subject if u come to class you will have no problem writing the papers
4,Yes  this is a good class if you like to slack off. You definitely don't have to come to every class. He shows ALOT of movies. I did go to every class and took notes which made it really easy to write the papers but you can just easily google the information too. I enjoyed his class. If you bother going you can learn some things.
5,Mr. Filson is hands down the best instructor i have encountered at Grcc! He goes above and beyond his duty and comes to class earily often! It is not a easy class but if you put in the hard work  ask questions(which he is always glad and eager to answer)  and attend class you should do well and even if you dont  you will learn to love his class.
5,Dr. Filson is a wonderful professor. I came away with an unexpected tremendous amount of knowledge about the Earth! It's a tough subject that he makes fun and interesting  and he's pretty forgiving in his grading. Do the reading and study guides  show up to class- you'll do well. I highly recommend him  and I'd love to take another class of his.
5,Mr. Filson is a very kind and understanding professor. It is not the easiest class  but if you work hard to understand what he is saying  you will get a good grade. Before the tests  he gives answers to the study guide  which really helps understand what will be on the test. I would love to take another one of his classes and highly recommend him!
5,An awesome teacher that really cares about you and your grade. He is very clear with what is on the exam  he even lets you drop an exam. Gives out fair amount of extra credit so getting a good grade in his class isn't too difficult
5,Lectures were interesting and informative. Normally wasn't much of a rock/earth person but found myself looking forward to class each day. Labs are AWESOME. Using tools real geologists do  and learning things that are relevant in many other fields. Overall a great guy and always willing to work with students individually to ensure learning.
5,Hands down my favorite instructor at Green River. Went into the class not expecting much but turned out amazing. He is extremely helpful and will go out of his way to help students. Lectures are informative and interesting. Very understanding of your mistakes and works with you to fix them. A+ teacher all around.
5,Great teacher! Very nice and helpful  all you have to do is follow the syllabus and study the rocks and you should do great in his class!
5,He is such a kind man. He cares about his students and will help you if you ask. He grades really easy and will give you a good grade if you try hard. He makes it interesting and there is very little homework
5,Such a kind instructor. Long lectures but he keeps it interesting by asking questions  using photos/ videos (sometimes recent ones)  and explains how it applies to you as a student. He always comes to class enthusiastic and ready to teach. Tests can be very long but if you study each chapter  and take good notes during his lectures you will pass.
5,Awesome teacher!!!!! I really like to take his class. As I am a international student  many terms I can't understand  and he just explain these terms in easy way and help me a lot!!! But the rock part is really hard.
5,I've taken three of Bob's classes. He is very easy to understand and make the subject matter interesting. He is always willing to answer questions. He is very clear on what will students will be tested on and provides handouts for note-taking/study guide purposes.
5,He's very good.
5,Filson is great  humorous and friendly! He is incredibly helpful and smart (has a phD in the subject). He seems to understand that students take this intro class simply as a requirement  so he emphasizes learning general ideas  rather than minute details that will be forgotten by anyone who's not a geology major.
4.5,My favorite teacher so far. He made geology fun and interesting and helped you anytime you needed it. field trips were easy. :) very fun class!
5,Excellent instructor. Very helpful and interesting. If you put some effort into the class (ie. attend  do the homework) you'll do fine. He wants people to do well. If you are a slacker  be prepared to be stressed with the workload. I also recommend the fieldtrips class (for an activity credit)
2.5,Bob is kinda cool... for a older guy. His class isn't TOO hard.. if you go. Not the most fun class in the world  but I definantly understand the earth a bit more? Really loves his subject.
5,While I can't profess any real interest in Geology  I appreciated this instructor's passion. You will learn alot  despite your best efforts. The perfect model of what a good teacher can accomplish. He really sets the bar high for his coworkers.
4.5,I have never been that interested in science  but Bob Filson was one of my favorite professors. He made the class fun and his lectures were actually INTERESTING! The tests were hard  but easy to make up for in other areas. I am totally amazed thinking back on how much I learned from his class. I actually looked forward to it every day!
5,This guy is a great teacher with extreme passion. He cares very much about you learning something. His explaining ability is a top notch  complex and incricate concepts come to be easily grasped after his explanations. Definetly recommended!
3,I didn't hate him. It was a HARD class so if you are not a slacker and like geology then this is the right class  otherwise find an easier science class and more interesting teacher to fill your credits.
5,Great instructor! Genuinely wants to help her students succeed. If you needed help outside of class  always took the time to make sure you understood. Recommended.
2,Didnt like her style at ALL! Too vague...has favorites and pretty cheesy!
5,She succeeded at getting me past my math fears where many others had failed miserably. A very warm  very motherly way about her. She's a hottie  too  but alas is very married with two kids.
4,Great teacher. Very smart and entertaining!
5,Very good professor  helpful and funny at the same time. Make sure you take all 4 test and the final  try your best and everything will work out in the end promise. Take Bob!
5,Bob.. Is fabulous! He helps people when they need help. If you are worried he will reassure you that everything will all work out in the end! He teaches you not to give up on yourself and to remember that you can do this work-- all you have got to do is try and take BOB!
3.5,Bob is great at what he does. I would ask him questions after class and seemed to get better feedback from him. He was always reachable by cell phone or email and always kept communication open. It is hard to maintain an A because there is no extra credit and your grade is based solely on 4 exams. Stay on top of work and practice problems.
2,he is mean. does not give extra credit or give any credit for homework. your grade depends on three exams and the final exam. its hard to pass if you arent already fluent in algebra. he doesnt explain much  he gets mad when we ask him to go over problems. many students in my class dropped the course.i wouldn't recommend this teache
5,By far the best math teacher I ever had. Took this class in spring and failed  so I decided to take it again in summer (everyone said not to because it would be harder) and passed with flying colors. He made the work so understandable! If you had questions he would help you. He went over everything and the text he used was cheap. Deff Recommend!!
4,Lighthearted and fun  he makes math interesting. He tends to go too fast thru some problems  you have to ask him to explain it or slow down. Only 2 tests  add them up and divide by 2 - that's your grade. The tests are fully comprehensive  however he doesn't give very difficult problems. This class blew my 4.0 GPA and I still recommend him.
5,He's a great teacher.He take his time to explain the work..his test are stree free and so i his classs....reconmend u take him.and he give you credit if ur ans is a little bit incorrect
5,Bob is the best teacher for math I dont like math but he made it fun and easy to understand. Would definitly recommend taking him. The tests come write out of the textbook. He will stay after class if you need help.
5,Bob Teti is a great teacher he is very easy to understand and if you need help he will stay after class to help you He make math fun and easy He goes over the homework in class and if you have any questions he will go over it even if he teached it. Would definitly recommend his class.
5,Bob Teti was a very good teacher he explained the topic. His notes really help you on the test and he tells you exactly what is going to be on the tests Homework is not mandatory but he will review/answer ?'s about the homework. Would highly recommend taking him for math.
5,Mr. Teti is one of the best teachers period I wish he taught everything. He's cool  easy going  kind  helpful  great at explaining the work  and this helps you get it  just all around great!!!! oh and the work was modest and exams pretty easy and im no math geek...TAKE HIM OVER THE OTHERS!
5,This guy could cut class with his Adonis like stature  if you know what I am saying. Good teacher  very clear with instructions and just as helpful. I took two exams and did my homework. Homework is not graded  but it will help you in the long run. Hardest nips this side of the Mississippi!
5,First let me state that I HATE MATH! Bob however was the best math teacher I ever had. He moves fast and writes a lot of notes...BUT I got it! It is the way he explains it..and if anyone didn't get it..he always would spend time after class explaining it until we did get it!! GREAT TEACHER!!
3,There was an awful lot of him writing on the board...copying problems...that took up alot of time. I thought he was a bit arrogant. The only reason I got a C was because I went to a tutoring class with an AWESOME russian woman whose name I forget. I would NOT take this professor again.
5,awesome luved his class.......
4.5,Great professor. Show up  Listen  and Study the work. He is young at heart and very fun. Makes math interesting!
5,Best math teacher I ever had! Highly recommend his class. I would take him for every math class if I could.
5,Mr.Teti is a great teacher. He comes to class ready to teach and will do all he can to make sure you understand the work.
5,HE ROCKS!! Bob really takes the stress out of learning math! He's focused on not making things hard for you so that you can get to Math 118 as quickly as possible. You get to keep the test questions so that if you fail he calls you with what you got wrong and you just bring your answers in. I wish he taught everything!
5,Great Teacher. Explained everything clearly and always wrote examples on the board. Never got below a 96 on any of his tests.
3.5,I took Mythology with Shelia  and it was a difficult class. she gives 2 tests and a paper. the tests cover a TON of material and are difficult to do well on. We didn't really discuss the reading  only the background/info  but the tests were mostly on the reading. very frustrating  plan on studying weeks in advance to get it all
2.5,Do not take her. It will be the best decision you ever make. Class is extremely boring
5,she's very cool. very funny. and will always help you when you need it. the class is boring for me  since all we do is talk about the books we're reading  but she's still very interesting to listen to at times. she's a funny old lady. :)
1,I am a great student and and the most difficult time with her class. She rambled on and on about nothing relevant. HER TESTS ARE RIDICULOUSLY HARD! The class consists of 2 tests  a paper and attendance. If you did poorly on 1 assignment there was no hope for raising your grade. DO NOT TAKE HER!!!!!!!!
4,She makes attendance mandatory  when it's not at all. Also  the coursepack you need for the class  I only looked at it once or twice the whole semester. Read the books and know about the authors  you will get an A. Bring other hw to this class or else you will fall asleep!
2,Lets just say she is boring. All she does is sit at her desk and read off her notes. The class is based off of attendance  three tests  and two papers. It was so hard not to fall asleep in the class... if you have to take this class  save yourself and do NOT take her
4,Great class. Some stuff on the test is from the lecture  but not much. I would listen to the back story and author bio  but you either need to read the books or listen to the lecture - not both. Exams are easy if you read/paid attention. She's very nice but a little senile.
2,What I got was stories about grandchildren  an old guy named Levi and a bunch of other stories I could do without. I had a declared male witch who talked throughout the class about anything from succesful spells to his druidic staff  and the teacher let him talk as much as he wanted. If you want a teacher as smart as the ones from high school...
4.5,Read the books and you'll do fine. The background reading really isn't even necessary. She's very personable  friendly. I liked her.
4.5,Very good. Just read the books and attend class and you'll be golden
3.5,She was nice. Wastes a lot of time in class though. Tests werent bad but you have to attend class because they are lecture based. Pretty easy grader.
4.5,Her classes are heavily lecture based. Her classes are relatively mangable (except the research paper). She is very respectful and is willing to help you when you need it.
5,The class is interesting and easy. Sheila is a wonderful women and very sweet!
1,"She is a bad teacher. The class consists of 2 tests and a paper. On the tests she asks things like  ""From the coursepack  the article __ was published in what year?"" Who cares what year it's published?! And she is incredibly boring. I seriously think she wrote all the nice comments about herself below this one. No one can actually think she's good."
5,She is a very nice lady. Very approachable and personable. Her teaching style is all lecture  with not much time or room for discussion. She is very thourough  if you go to class and take notes  you'll do fine. I didn't read most of the books and still got an A-. The term paper is alot of work don't put it off till the last minute!
4,She is a great teacher. While the class is mostly a pre-req for most students she makes the class fun and enjoyable. Good teacher. I would recommend her.
3,Shes nice but really boring.
5,I simple adore this prof! She is very easy to reach out of class and is helpful if you get stuck during an exam. Very funny and has study guides for the tests in the coursepack. No final  just tests.
5,Professor Most is the best. She is such a wonderful person in class as well as outside of class. She genuinely cares about her students  and that isn't something you see in a Professor very often. I highly recommend World Mythology  and I'm taking Multicult. Children's Lit just cuz she's the prof
5,She is one of the most detailed professors that I've taken. She is concerned about students and their learning  and she is willing to help in any way that she can. I've taken her 2x's and she knows her stuff.
3.5,Thought you would do good because you aced composition 1 and have had mostly a's and a b here and there throughout the semesters? Think again. Takes off lots of points for small errors and so far has assigned topics that I find very vague and hard to write about. Crossing my fingers that I can just pass and not lose my scholarship...
4.5,Mrs. Pruett is a great teacher but is extremely un forgiving when grading. If you make minor mistakes in grammar  or can't quite write a 1000 word structured essay in an hour in class without any preparation  or have not so good writing style  be prepared to struggle. She is really nice and helpful but her class is EXTREMELY difficult.
5,great teacher. made a really boring book interesting.
5,Teacher was laid back and very helpful.
5,I loved her. She was the best teacher that I've ever had. She got us to understand Shakespeare  and I guess  she got me to love Shakespeare. I had her twice in high school: for 10th grade honors english and shakespeare class.
4.5,Hardest but best English teacher I ever had. I whined along with everyone else when she graded us strictly but I'm so glad I took her class and I learned a ton from it

5,Great teacher and I'd advise taking him! He really helps out and the exams are a piece of cake if you study for them.
4,Hard but fair
1,No Comments
1,Worst professor I have ever had. 50% of the exams are based on material that he breezed over in 30 seconds the first week of school. He doesn't use slides. Overall  well  I can't say it if I want this post to appear. But I have never seen so many peop
4.5,Need to get sophomore English out of the way? This class is a really great way to do it in 6 weeks over the summer. It's a lot less stress to write many short  not style heavy papers over the traditional long paper. You'll have fun and get to meet others through interaction and discussion unlike the normal class.
5,By far the most interesting and engaging English class  bordering on things like sociology and psychology. The coursework is NOT structured in the sense that there are criteria that must be met  rather you make your opinions anyway you see fit. This allows for a lot of creativity and fun. Even as a science major  I thoroughly enjoyed this professor
4,Professor E is such a sweetheart and will make you think outside the box. Her class is engaging and a real thought provoker. I used to absolutely detest having to take English but she changed the way I feel about the subject. You will leave the class with a new and improved sense of analyzing situations and a new sense in creative writing.
5,She's amazing! The way she teaches is like she's learning with you and it's make you feel more comfortable and confident in learning. You feel really involved in her class because we had daily class discussions about real interesting topics. Be prepared to write short easy pieces everyday but everything about this class helps and you'll enjoy it.
5,Mrs. E is among the best teachers I've ever met. English was for a long time my least favorite subject  and prior to taking Mrs. E I was not looking forward to xe2x80x9cdrudging through another English classxe2x80x9d. However  Mrs. Exe2x80x99s class blew me away. She covers some incredibly fascinating topics and she gives you free reign to explore them. Take her class.
4,Ms. E was truly one of my favorite professors of all time. She really was able to make me think out of the box and fill my brain with knowledge about things that are never really spoken about. As long as you do all your writing assignments every night  which will be assigned every single night  you will pass the class without any problems!
5,Excellent teacher. I would recommend this class to everyone attending Sac City College. Other professors are boring  trust me.
4.5,Ms. E  as she is likely to have you call her  is a teacher that embodies what  in my opinion  is the pinnacle of teaching. By delving into material that is new  unfamiliar  or even beyond her current comprehension  she challenges students to think deeply  and holds herself to the same standard. Take her only if you desire to be challenged and grow.
5,She is an amazing teacher. You will learn how to whip up a thoughtful essay in no time after this class. She is very personal and honest. One of my favorite and most memorable teachers I've ever experienced.
5,Rachel's class was transformative. She is real. She genuinely cares about her students and there are no topics off limits from her class discussions. Be ready to grow as a human being if you take her class. If you participate in discussions you will do well. She is fair and understanding and does not grade harsh. I loved her class!
5,Echoing another review  Ms. Edelson takes her students' work seriously. She spends a lot of time editing essays and helping her students develop their ideas. She has an unimposing brilliance that inspired me to produce some of the best essays I have ever written. I would recommend taking this class solely for the collage essay.
5,Simply put: If you have an opportunity to study with Rachel Edelson  take that opportunity. Rachel is a deeply inspiring thinker and human being who takes personally the development of each one of her students. When you speak in class (and you will speak in class) she listens attentively and REMEMBERS what you share  even months  or years  later.
4.5,This is not your typical English class. Instead of dreary lectures we had riveting class discussions about shocking issues. In place of monotonous grammar homework  we had assignments that required opinion  thought  and action. Ms. Edelson has an unrivaled passion for teaching that is evident in her class. Without doubt  I highly recommend her.
4.5,I CANNOT RECOMMEND RACHEL EDELSON MORE HIGHLY! IF YOU TRULY CARE ABOUT LEARNING  TAKE HER CLASS! I had the privilege of taking ENG1A at SCC while in high school  and it saved me from absolute depression about school. In marked contrast to the stultifying English classes at CKM  Edelson really engaged and supported our critical thinking and writing.
4.5,Rachel Edelson is easily the most engaging  inspiring English teacher I ever studied with. Her classes aren't easy  because she respects students enough to truly challenge themxe2x80x93and herselfxe2x80x93to grapple with complex themes and reading material. As with any great class  you'll get what you put into it  so do yourself a favor and give it your all.
5,Take this class!
5,This was one of my favorite courses. Edelson is an invaluable facilitator of education. We begun the class by improving lexicon and even covered how the words one uses changes perception of one and also how one perceives the world. There was never a dull moment  never a time when I felt the mechanisms of my mind not being utilized.
5,I attended Eng300 and Eng302 at my high school. The homework was always interesting which made it easier to respond to. The best part about the class would have to be the discussions on the topics researched. You really get a lot out what you put into it and if you struggle  the discussion helps spark new ideas. I highly recommend this class.
5,By supplying our class with heated topics to write about  she made it to where we weren't just writing brainless  dry essays. 1st half of class is going over upcoming assignments  addressing the concerns of the students and going over useful grammar and punctuation tips  Then we shared thoughts about the homework. We wrote 2 short papers a week.
3.5,Two 500 word essays due a week. Class starts by useful grammer tips. The next hour she calls on every person to see how they feel about the topic for the essay. The essay topics are mostly revolved around politics  money  and every once in awhile something interesting.
4,Dr. Frarris is great. He writes all the notes for you and posts them online. He makes the tests easy to study for. He is very helpful and will talk with you on any subject that isn't clear.
4,I really liked Dr. F. He explains things in class  I agree with the person that said he kinda expects you to already know it. He put all homework and quizzes online. Easy class if you can put enough effort into the online HW.
3.5,I thought his class was really hard. The astronomy labs were really easy but I thought the tests were hard. I took notes every day and read my book and still never made an A on a test.
3.5,Overall he is a nice professor. But if you like note taking he is the person to take  his tests are pretty hard because he is not a visual person it seems like he just expects you to know it.
5,He is a great teacher. He is willing to help you if you don't understand something  and he is willing to explain things in different ways to help you understand. He does talk monotone sometimes  but he'll get excitied as he goes through lessons. Highly recommended.
4,Dr. Farris is very helpful with answering questions in class  the tests are very easy as long as you go to class and take notes. He grades fairly easy  but his class is kinda boring if your not real interested in the topic being discussed.

5,he's very cool  his labs are great. but he actually said in class one day that he was so monotone that he was putting himself to sleep. if you take his class  you'll learn as long as you are drinking a ton of coffee
3,Overall Dr. Farris is good teacher. He has a wealth of knowledge and is very fair. He doesn't give every answer away and he promotes critical thinking. If he is lacking in anything  it would be his teaching style. Visual learners may not find his explanations perfectly clear.
4.5,Dr. Farris is really smart and can answer just about anything you want to know about the universe. He is nice and has a good sense of humor  and his notes adequately prepare you for the tests. His labs are usually very interesting.
3,I understand why people love him  but I have some reservations. He'd sometimes aggressively pick on the kid in our class who'd ask too many questions (fair enough  but I think the kid had some social issues)  and although I appreciated he was honest he might have done more to discourage than encourage Brilliant Professor though  teaches very well
5,Best CS prof I've had at McGill. Lectures are extremely clear and concise  and Prakash really cares about his students doing well. He has stayed well past his office hours to help students in the past.
5,Very clear and efficient at teaching. It took me some time to fully understand recursion  but after I got it  it was really easy. IT'S JUST BLACK MAGIC! Final class average should be at least B+
5,He really has the right way to teach. His presentation of the material is simply efficient. I could understand everything the first time. The assignments and exams implied more thinking than actual writing and were sometimes challenging  but always rewarding.
5,Legit wizard. People find comp 302 hard because it's quite foreign but Prakash is a wizard at teaching this stuff. Going to his class was an actual treat  I'll take any class that he's teaching. About half the class was done the final within an hour.
5,Love him
5,best prof ever
5,I'll take any class if Prakash teaches it.
5,Very easy class. Don't skip class + understand A.
2.5,Legend
1.5,A+ prof. Get ready to spend all of your time on the homework assignments (worth 40% of the semester and are insanely tough). Tests are OK. Don't skimp out on the assignments.
1,Great teacher. you should probably learn the material before taking the course. Very hard even for someone who knows programming.
1,Way too hard.
4.5,A great lecturer  passionate with what he's teaching. Really funny.
4.5,Great lectures  very clear and consist. However  go see the TAs if you have a question unless you are absolutely stuck. If you ask him a question because you're confused get ready for a verbal thrashing.
1,"Prakash is honestly very overrated. Loves to intimidate students  and is extremely cocky and arrogant. I went to him for help and all he did was spit in my face about how I need to pay more attention in class.. I obviously went to him because I didn't understand his notes but he doesn't understand how anyone could not understand his ""amazing notes"""
4.5,Loved this course. Prakash does a great job giving the material life through his dedication to getting the information across. Assignments were fair  took some work  but they were quite interesting and indicative of what to expect on tests. One thingtrusting my interest in the course  I barely studied for the final and lost a letter grade for it.
5,Amazing prof  really cares about his students. Posts very detailed notes online to make sure everybody understands. Lectures are entertaining and funny. Assignments are very interesting. Exams are fair and the exam material is explicitly laid out beforehand. He puts emphasis on the exactness of communications to avoid any ambiguity.
4.5,What a wonderful professor and wonderful course. He clearly tells you exactly what will be on the midtermfinal  emphasizes the most important info in class  and is a very fun prof. He tries his best to learn everyone's name too. I absolutely loved this class. Avg midtermfinal grades were high as well.
5,Great professor. Easy assignments and exams. Required very little studying  but was still very interesting. Would highly recommend.
3,Professor McCoy is not the reason I had to withdraw from this class. This class is not a class you want to take online. My only issue was the labs. They were hard to understand. I would work on them for hours and think I knew what I was doing and then would fail them. I suggest at least taking the lab in person if you take online classes.
1.5,I decided to take this class on video because I needed to learn but not have to drive all the way to Gallatin. In this class you have to read and anwser questoins over 10 chapters at a time!! CRAZY!! The labs were so hard and uncomprehensible. I would not recomend anyone take this class on video because its just to confusing.
5,Really great teacher. Answers e-mails promptly. Will stay late to help you. One of the best!
4.5,Very helpful...will even stay after on exam days to help with labs that you didnt understand until you get finished.
5,TAKE THIS CLASS! As long as you take notes and study you will pass. Chris is great at explaining things. There are 4 lecture tests and 3 lab tests  and he puts lots of info on elearn to help you study.
2,His class is very hard. and it's an 8am class for me so it's very hard for me to stay awake. the whole semester is based on 4 exam grades and your lab grade. and the exams are very hard.
5,Mr. Beals is an AWESOME teacher! I wish he could teach all my other classes! He will repeat and explain this as many times as needed! Also going to SI is a big plus..Sandra the SI teacher is fantastic  and helps out soooooo much! and Mr  Beals gives you extra credit for going!
4,"I loved this teacher! The material is hard  but he'll explain it 10 times if needed. Regular attendance is vital as tests comes from lectures. He's quirky & fun. Take him for lab as well. Textbook not needed but very helpful. On a side note  he looks  talks & acts just like a young Matthew Broderick (watch the movie ""Godzilla"" and you'll see)"
5,I absoultely LOVED this teacher! If you are horrible at science  take Chris Beals! He is amazing! He looks like Harry Potter:) He helped me understand so many things that I never understood in other science classes  he talks to you like a student not a teacher  he wants everyone to get an A  and gives you extra points  and extra credit! Great Guy!
4.5,chris did a great job showing you what you needed to concentrate on in the labs for the exams and what you didn't. He walked you thorugh the labs and would help you anytime you needed him to via open labs  phone calls or email. great guy! Take him when you can!! There were 3 exams and a couple quizzes but he gave you study guide for all of them
5,He's a great teacher. It's his first year back at Vol State in a about five years. He explains things as many times as you need it explained. He's very good at explaining it and loves answering questions. His test aren't bad. Just study the notes and you'll be fine. He will help you out with anything you need and his pretty laid back.
5,Very Helpful...always willing to explain things in a different way if you don't get it the first time. Tests are hard but come from his notes mostly. Wish he taught A&P2.
5,He is limitless in his energy and his love for Biology. He is always helpful and always willing to answer questions or look them up if he doesn't know the answer. One of the best professors I've ever had.
5,he is a good teacher. he is very helpful and always at open labs. he made the class fun and i understood things better than i thought i would.
2,Lab 2010
1.5,VERY BORING!!! He reads from his powerpoints and expects you to learn on your own pretty much.. He is not hard  you just have to keep yourself motivated because he sure wont.
1.5,Tough class I will have to say. Professor is very vague  and all of the studying is up to you....no hints at all as to what will be covered. So basically you have to know every word in order to get a good grade. Tough  but I have learned A&P.
1.5,I am in his last class before he retires. BE THANKFUL YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HIM AS YOUR TEACHER!!! He doesn't stay focused. He goes off on things not related to this class. His tests are overly in depth and he lies about what is actually on them. He uses wrong solutions in the lab saying they work the same yet give different results.
1,Typical Charles Darwin believing biology teacher. He is boring and his assignments are incomprehensible. Avoid!
3,Wouldn't recommend him  but its not impossible to pass his class. I dropped it and am taking Frank and Farrar. Take those two guys if you can.
1,I didn't like his teaching style. He is very vague when he teaches. He once sent an e-mail to all students sorry missed class I was busy. I thought that was so rude  I dropped his class after that episode. I would suggest another biology teacher.
1,I had him years ago and I can honestly say he is not good at teaching. I have no idea where volstate finds their biology teachers  but they need to start looking elsewhere!!!
5,Mr. Schbig is a super nice teacher. He will help you in any way if you just ask!! His lectures are kind of boring  but he gives you power point notes and reads straight from them. all of the test are simple as long as you study the notes given to you. Human Anatomy is a hard class and he understands that. He really breaks things down for you. Great
3,Passing this class is very simple. Just study the powerpoints. Thats it.
2,His class is very boring. He does not teach you  he read to you and you must teach yourself. He does not read the lab until he get into class. He will mark off for things he did not ask for on labs and tests. He is unorganized and has lost labs.
3,He is very monotone ... but he prepares you for is tests. They key is showing up to class everyday  printing off the powerpoint notes  take notes as he is talking  and study like crazy! I got an A and his tests were mostly fill-in the blank. As long as you study your heart out  it does not matter who the teacher is  you will get an A!
1.5,He is a boring teacher to listen to. He reads everything straight off the powerpoint. His tests are incredible hard.He will put you to sleep during lecture. I would take MANN over this guy for lecture.
4,Not a bad teacher at all. If you study you will make a good grade on the test. If you don' miss any days in his class he will give you extra points on your final grade!
3.5,He has all the personality of a carpet sample  but his class is pretty cut and dry. Just print off the power point slides and study those. If you do that you should be OK.
3.5,Schibig is a boring teacher but his class is not hard at all. If you study the powerpoint notes you will pass the test. I think that most students dont like him because they havent realized yet that this is college and not high school  and that they need to grow up and do the work!!!!!
5,"Dr. Schbig was awesome in the fact that he was incredibly easy. Made an ""A"" no problem. He will put you to sleep while talking  and has a dry  old since of humor  but its funny. Not a bad teacher for Biology. Would recommend because he's incredibly easy!"
2.5,Don't take Schibig if you don't have to  take MANN. This guy only cares about Tennessee Chesnut trees? How does that relate to A&P  I don't know. All test came from powere point. And he reads that power point word for word! VERY BORING! UGH  and i liked this subject before i met him.
4,Lectures are all done with powerpoint slides. Test questions are taken from information in those slides. Good teacher - knows his stuff and explains well for people new to anatomy.
4,He is a little dull  but a very thorough teacher. He does no review for a test  but his test come right from his power point notes. He is growing on me. He gives extra credit  too. He also lets you know what the extra credit is ahead of time. Give him a chance.
1,his tests are made from his power point lectures  but his tests did not look like anything that the class had covered. he is not an understanding teacher. he will address a problem that he has with a person in front of the class.
3.5,"I signed up to take a Science class  not a Sermon that ridicules current scientific theory. His answer for how things came about is   ""God did it!"". He originally ridiculed evolution but he finally taught some science and briefly touched on Evolution but after class he held a meeting for the religous fanatics in the class to explain why it was fals"
4,Pretty good teacher. He will tend to teach more to the pretty girls in the class and does waste a large amount of time flirting  but over all not bad. At least he grades pretty easy.
5,Russ was one of the greatest professors I have ever had. He will get off the subject and keep things light. He is the coolest and it does not hurt that he is pretty easy on the eyes.
4,this professor is extremely easy  helpful  laid back and considerate of students being adults with busy lives. beware that she makes everybody be socialable and participate  so if you prefer to keep to yourself  quietly - you might have tough time. attendance affects your grade with her. but other than that  its a very easy class.
1.5,Terrible. He's very repetitive. Says one thing and does another. I feel I would have done a whole lot better in this class if I had taken another professor. Would not recommend.
4,Dr. Frank is a great professor! His lectures tend to be on the boring side but he tries to make it entertaining by throwing in jokes. Tests are easy if you REALLY study the study guides. Always willing to help and work around your schedule. Always writes nice comments and smiley faces on exams if you do well! He's great!
4.5,Great and very helpful. Dry sense of humor  but when he gets down to business he demands respect when talking.
3.5,I took frank for A&P 1 and 2. He is a great teacher! Very helpful and understanding. This class isnt easy but if you show up and show effort you should pass. Make sure to go to his Test Review classes  they are very helpful!! Definately recommend this teacher over all the others. I recieved an A and A&P1 and B in A&P2.
5,Dr. Frank is amazing. I appreciated the stories he told about using what we were learning in his medical practice. His tests are difficult  but his reviews are incredible. You'll learn a lot with Dr. Frank!
5,Very good teacher  he gives out study guides which are a little helpful with the examns but as long as you attend class you will be fine. he does gives a review class that you have to attend on your own at the given time he gives  but if you can go he gives tremendous hints about what is on the exam. I would recommend him to anyone.
4.5,Dr. Frank made my science experience great. He is very caring when it comes to his students. Yes his jokes are old and outdated but his ability to teach is great. I still remember the points he made utilizing those jokes.
5,Dr.Frank is a great professor.I find it funny that all the bad ratings for Dr.Frank have bad grammar and spelling errors.Study his review if you want a B. Know the book for an A. He is very kind and considerate.
4.5,He's really helpful and if you talk to him and ask him questions he will go out of his way to help you. He wants everyone to succeed his class. All you have to do is ask. He's always helpful outside of class also.
3.5,Pretty easy  as long as you keep the notes he gives you  you're set.
5,I think he is an awesome teacher. I had to retake this class after summer 5wk course that was awful. Dr. Frank actually taught me something and was always willing to help. He does not over-complicate things at all. Hands out study guides of what will be on tests and offers extra credit.
4.5,Love Dr. Frank!! Funny  nice  willing to help anytime  and really cares! He knows a lot about AP and can answer most questions right away! Gives helpful handouts and all you have to do is listen and study! It was a great class b/c he made it fun and a lot less stressful!!!! Would take him again!
4.5,Nice teacher. Tries to make the subject fun and is willing to help if you don't understand. He gives out study guides with what will be on the test. Highly recommended!!!
4.5,Nice guy. Good teaher. Funny. Cares about students learning the material and succeeding in life. Highly recommend.
3,Very all over the place. He likes to tell stories and unfunny jokes....but he's a nice man and seems to care about the student. He gives you study guides before the tests but some of the things on the test aren't on the guide. Take LOTS of notes and read the text.
3,He loves what he teaches. Funny. Teaches until the last second. His lectures are scattered around sometimes. Very nice and always willing to help you  or answer any questions. Tests are pretty hard  in my opinion. Do not just study the 'study guide' he gives you! Study everything! Notes  diagrams  AND book info! Overall  great teacher. :o)
3.5,So I took him for several classes and I always dropped him. He goes too slow and repeats the same stories in every single class. He made sleepy. He also skips around on the subjects too so I could not organize the info in my head... you have to be there  his tests come straight from the notes. Write down EVERYTHING he says.
5,Dr. Frank loves to teach and it shows! He goes at a pace where everyone can keep up. If anyone has a problem he will take the time to help. I had him for both lab & lecture and would definetly take him again.
5,Dr. Frank loves to teach and it shows! He goes at a pace where everyone can keep up. If anyone has a problem he will take the time to help. I had him for both lab & lecture and would definetly take him again.
5,He was very helpful  but hard to listen to as his voice is monotone. I do like him and would reccomend him.
3.5,"tough  but awesome! helped me realize i love biology with a passion too! but don't be surprised if she picks favorites by the first test  though  that's how she weeds out her class and finds her ""star pupils"""
2,SCATTERBRAINED is the best word to describe her. I probably caught her class at a bad time because her dad was about to die  and she probably should have taken the summer off to be with him instead of trying to teach also. Hard tests  boring lectures  pointless labs. Nice lady though
2.5,Overall Mrs.Morris's class was hard. She teaches by powerpoint. But some of the info on the test is from the book. So read. Her test are extra hard!!!and thats the only thing that you get a grade for in the lecture part of class theres no homework or anything so you must do well on the test i wouldnt take her again
3.5,I loved her who is helpful and always nice~! but ..... her tests were too hard!!! too many questions that she didn't teach in the class. many questions on the tests came from the textbook which is more than 300 pages.
5,Now  I kinda like her style o' teachin'  I tell you what. She's a bit eccentric  but she's alright. You just gotta put a lil elbow grease into the class. However  you is right about them labs. They is just some long lectures.
2,She needs to be more enthusiastic in her classes. You can easily fall asleep listening to her talk for an hour and a half!
1,No Comments
3,I hated Ms. Morris's way of teaching!! The whole semester all we did was go through powerpoint slides.. The tests commonly didn't match what we had gone through in class  and the labs were really just 3 hour long lectures.
5,A&P is an extremely hard class regardless of the teacher but Prof Mann was great. Not very enthusiastic but he tells you exactly what you need to know through his PowerPoints. It's all memorization. You definitely have to study your butt of  but as long as you do that you should do fine. NOTE CARDS ARE A MUST! Only used my book to study bones/musc
5,A&P is hard. Prof Mann makes it easier by being very precise with the material. You always know what to expect on tests. Never a surprise. If you study you will do well. If you don't you probably won't. But Prof Mann is an excellent teacher and does not overwhelm you.
4,The Online class is great. His test is basically directly off of his powerpoints . It is worth taking his class. He is easy and a down to earth teacher  which makes A&P easier to digest than others but A&P is naturally a lot of material by itself. I am in the nursing program. Just make sure your nursing program will accept an online A&P class.
5,I thoroughly enjoyed Professor Mann's BIOL 2010 class at the Highland Crest campus. I will be taking him for BIOL 2020 this upcoming semester. He tells you exactly what he expects you to know on each test. There are no guessing games. Test questions come right from his power points.
4,Dr. Mann is an awesome teacher! He knows the material inside and out. You know exactly what he expects on exams and where your grade stands at any point in the semester. He uses schematics to explain main points and online lectures give you a chance to review for exams. He is very helpful and an all around good person.
5,Awesome professor! He is extremely helpful and clear on what he expects from students. Didn't need the book. All lecture tests are from his power points. Lab study guides are very direct and helpful. He is very understanding and treats students with respect. Wish he taught Micro! I recommend his hybrid class for sure!
5,Dr. Mann is a class act. He is very approachable  clear cut  helpful  and generous. He gives you every opportunity to succeed in a tough course. Just study his Power Point notes and audio lectures and really know pathways. He is very enjoyable to listen to and has a great sense of humor.
4,Mann  is great! It's a hard class but I love it!
5,Dr. Mann is an AMAZING professor. I had him for A&P 1&2. He is thorough in his lectures but not too much. If you want to learn extra  ask and he will tell you as much as you'd like. I learned so much in this class. As long as you read the PowerPoints and pay attention you'll pass this class. Best professor I've had.
5,I took his summer A&P I class and just like any other science  it was a difficult. But I did take the time to study and I passed with an A. He's a great teacher. He tells you exactly what's going to be one the tests. I had to write 2 papers  but the maximum length was 1 page and a half. And if you do miss a class  he has all his lectures online.
5,My favorite Teacher so far! Professor Mann makes this class enjoyable & comfortable. He's funny & class is doable as long as you study. He is knowledgeable & helpful
5,Mr. Mann is one of the best anatomy teachers at Volstate. He makes sure that you have all of the material that you need for the tests. I will be taking him for anatomy 2.
4.5,I really like Professor Mann. He was extremely clear about what he wanted and though his test were difficult they were completely doable if you put a little time into studying. i would definitely recommend taking him  he is an excellent teacher. I plan to take him next semester and wish that he taught lectures at the gallatin campus.
5,Dr. Mann rocks! If you PAY ATTENTION to his lectures in class AND online he gives you everything you need to be successful. He will explain anything to you  BUT you have to ask. This is not an easy class  AND YOU HAVE TO STUDY! The time you put in will directly show in your grade.
5,The absolute best professor I have EVER had. He is very intelligent and willing to help  if you're willing to help yourself! I barely cracked open my book  EVERY thing comes from his power points. I would recommend him to ANYONE! I took the online/lab hybrid class and LOVED it.. well  as much as you can love Anatomy :/
5,Professor Mann is a great teacher. His test come straight from the Power Point Notes. The essay questions for the test come from Interactive PHYS. He gives some extra credit throughout the semester-mainly from mastering A&P assignments. You only need your book for the mastering A&P assignments  but you can use the e-text instead to save money.
4,A&P is hard...no matter what. But I did like Dr. Mann. He was clear about what he expected. He did not give you a study guide for the tests  but he did tell you what to study for the essay questions. His tests were hard. But he gives bonus and easy quizzes and extra credit. I did not do well on the tests but still made a B.
5,I took lecture online and lab on campus. Lecture test are not the easiest alot of fill in the blanks. Lab was super easy. I like Mr. Mann and I will take him again. He gives you alot of bonus points as well so if you do bomb a test you have a chance to make it up. This class has alot of homework but not to hard.
5,There are 13 online quizzes  and 5 Lec. exams. 10 online Lab quizzes  and 3 Lab exams. A lot of info  but his power points are awesome. I hardly used the book mainly just used the power points. There are chances for bonus points and extra credit. He is very helpful and accessible. I would take him for A&P 2 but he is not scheduled for that class.
5,Excellent teaching skills. Gives lots of great tools to ensure that students keep up with assignments. Best professor I've had thus far.
4.5,DO THE STUDY GUIDE! THAT IS THE TEST! Fill it out and memorize it and you'll get an A. Anyone saying otherwise is ridiculous and didn't study. Very very possible to get an A in this class. You won't use the book at all. I had him for A and P 1 and 2 and Micro  got A's in all. STUDY!
4.5,Pretty cool guy. easy to get along with. I did well without the power points  hand wrote the notes  got an A with them. Talks real loud because he can't hear himself.
5,Very good teacher. Read over his Powerpoints and you will pass. ALL of the questions come from that! He has mulitple choice  fill in the blank  definitions  and 2-3 essay questions. Which he gives you if you ask. He also has a review. Study and you will do well!
3,Horrible. Unless this is the only class you are taking  I dont recommend him. You have to study literally everyday to maybe make a C. His lab is ok  but lecture is just ridiculous.
5,Mr.Hackney is a great teacher!I did A&P I II & Micro with him and passed all 3 subjects with an 'A'. Very pleasent and helpful.I never had a science background but i learnt a lot from him.What u've to do is study well his PPT & reveiews.He gives 4 quizzes & 5 exams.Pls don't wait fr the last moment to study.sure u would pass with an A. Trust me!
1,Impossible to pass! Don't buy book. Study study study and whatever you do... don't forget to study!
4,I HAVE TO RE-TAKE THIS CLASS UGHHHH!!! THE TEST ARE WAY HARDER THAN YOU'D EXPECT THEM TO BE! THE BOOK ISNT REQUIRED BECAUSE ALL HIS NOTES ARE ONLINE (LOTS OF NOTES). WISH I WOULD HAVE READ THESE COMMENTS LAST SEMESTER
4,His tests are very very hard. hardly anyone passes them. I would study for hours everyday and barely make a c. He does know what he is talking about  but sometimes he makes you out to be an idiot if you ask questions. This is a very hard course. Don't take it and a&p in the same semester! Don't buy the book. Lextures are straight from powerpoint
4,Mr.Hackney is a great teacher.I had him for A&P I.( i didn't know anything abt biology.I studied his PPT completely and the reviews.Ipassed with an A+.I reccomend highly for all the biology classes!You don't need to buy the book
3.5,"He is a hard teacher very dry and boring  but I made an  ""A"" and I am no bookworm. A lot of people give him a bad review becuase he is not and easy pass. Do the work required and you will do well he gives you studyguides. This is college  not kindergarden  it's not supposed to be easy."
1.5,He would announce 11 ppl rcvd an A  B  or C on exams  thats a 33% passing rate! Textbook is useless! Never opened it! He does his best to humiliate you for your lack of knowledge. NO open discussion  you show up  take notes(reading off the PP)& take exam. If you request any information or ask for clarification  you do this at your own risk!
4.5,This is not an easy subject  but Mr. Hackney presents it in a straightforward clear manner. If your willing to do your part you will get a good grade.
1,The class is confusing. We do not have a textbook and he does not teach to each student.
5,I took Hackney's Micro lab and it was easy  except for the tests of course. I had Carter for Lecture...wish I could have gotten into Hackney's lecture too.
2.5,He is not one of my favorite teachers. If you like to stare at power points the whole class then you will be fine. He does give you the review but if you expect the test to be worded anything like the review then think again you better know the material inside and out. You will definately EARN your grade in this class!!
4.5,He's a great teacher  and he makes a tough subject a little easier. He gives you study guides and just wants you to grasp the main ideas  he doesn't stress the tiny details. He really knows all about anything even related to the subjects we discuss in class. I'd reccommend him to anyone who needed to take A&P I or II or Micro.
4,Mr. Hackney is a wonderful teacher and if you just take the time to memorize all of his powerpoints you will do great in this class. Oh and don't buy the book. I've only opened up 2 times and could have found the info from it elsewhere and saved $130.
4,Don't buy the book! Write down all of his powerpoint notes and you'll be ok. Super nice person  decent teacher. Tests hard  but review completely covers the test.
4,He is thorough  but if you study and keep up w/ the material  the class isn't really hard  I got an A.
5,The best professor I have had at EMU. He is so passionate and this class is so relevant to the education department. He loves discussion  and is completely interested in his students'. There is a ton of reading  but he has perfected this course so that all readings are appropriate. Loved this professor!
3,I really enjoyed this class. His discussions were important and relevant to education today. However  there is usually a RIGHT opinion to have in his class  you'll know what it is. Papers are only 3-5pgs and are ridiculously regimented (there is a thesis template). I felt like a was writing a MEAP essay again.
5,"D is a truly remarkable educator. He is passionate about what he practices and it transcends to the students. He is an inspiring professor  and the ""writing intensive"" part of the course is hardly noticeable  in part because we write a little every day. It is reading intensive  however  the reading is valuable and fascinating."
4,I enjoyed a lot of the material. It is a discussion based class and it can be fun. (Although  I had a dissenting opinion once and I felt a little disrespected by D. I got over it and he didn't hold it against me). I didn't think we did a lot of writing because it was little pieces every class period and not a lot of big papers. Good class overall.
5,The class isn't the most interesting but D is great! He's really funny and nice and loves what he's doing. Expect a lot of reading. Participation in class and attendance is key. He just wants you to have an opinion and think/talk about what we're discussing.
5,He will do everything to help you with anything. He is a super nice and funny guy.
5,"The readings are interesting and his lectures are very participatory. He truly cares about and respects his students. ""D"" sets a great example for future teachers."
5,It's 328W. The 'W' stands for writing-intensive
4,Very good  and very helpful. Most of class is self-graded  and he's very helpful on the parts that aren't. Expect to do a lot of reading and participate a lot in class. The class can seem a little pointless  but it's easy to fake it until you make it.
4,Lots of reading. You are expected to keep up and be engaged in class. Participation matters to this professor - so if you don't speak up  don't expect to do well. The curve is a bit strange  a 94 is an A-. Overall  Dee asks you to think about some important ideas and engage in a high level of discourse.
4,This class involves A LOT of reading. In class you grade yourself on how well you prepared for that day. You actually do that quite often. His grading scale is not the regular scale - a 94% is an A- and a 91% is a B+. He chooses favorites. It was an alright class  but I didn't really get anything out of it.
4,He is very passionate about his subject area and loves for students to be enthusiastic. He wants everyone contributing in class discussions. He definitely has favorites  and even though I was one of them  it made me very uncomfortable. You won't do as well if you have a different opinion than he does  which is not fair. He really cares about the cl
5,Very informative class. What I liked best was that the class work was NOT lecture-based. It was discussion  but also included dynamic  higher level learning activities. The course content is very useful for diverse classroom settings. The readings and issues brought up in the course are relevant. All viewpoints were encouraged and excepted.
5,Dr. Castanier is an asset to EMU staff and all education students. He shares information that is pertinent to creating a professional teacher!
5,Duane is a great professor and role model. The work 4 the class is ALOT but U should already know that coming in2 any SOFD 328 class. He loves his job which reflects his passion for the class. Lots of busy work but nothing 2 major. Very eye opening course you will take with you for the rest of your teaching career! EMU should be proud 2 have him!
3,I wasn't impressed with this professor at all. He is a very nice person  but as a prof  I was unhappy with the unreasonable workload and how he plays favorites. This is the most useless class in the COE  but everyone must take it. He's not horrible but definitely get in on his good side and you'll do well.
2,Castiner cares a little too much about al this stuff. Most of the readings are not that exciting  though a few are potentially useful. He thinks all of the reading connect to each other somehow. There is a typed HW assmt due every class. HW is self graded  but is still a hassle. Also  get on his good side and you have smooth sailing.
5,Best class yet in the department of education. Truly useful material! Thanks D!
5,Great teacher.
5,By far the best teacher  and course that I have ever taken in my life. This class is a lto fo hard work but you enjoy it. There is a lot of reading but most of the class time is spent on discussions. Every educaiton major should take this course with Dee.
1.5,Terrible grading system. Believe us on the posts here to take a different teacher if you can. I thought it would not be as bad  I was wrong. TAKE ANOTHER TEACHER IF YOU CAN.
1,Terrible teacher! Will not let you redo anything . She has a weird grading system so good luck making an A in her class. I will not ever take her again for another class
5,This was an easy class  Mrs. Stephens was always eager to help out in any way. Gives a crazy amount of BONUS points. I mean seriously  sure you've gotta study  but if you take it online use your TEXTBOOK when you take tests  the tests are straight from it. As long as you follow the simple instructions it's not bad at all. I made a 97%! HA!
4.5,There is A TON of reading involved in this class. The teacher is helpful and good about returning emails and calls. The assignments are not that bad but the tests are horrible. She offers extra credit for pop quizzes over each chapter....DO THEM...it will help your overall grade.
1.5,"Slow at returning emails  slow at grading and opening tests to review. Rude  unprofessional. Will not take her for anything ever again. Will not listen to reasoning and questions students. Speaks down to those who disagree with her ""teaching"" methods and avoids questions and concerns as well. DO NOT TAKE HER IF YOU CAN FIND ANOTHER TO TAKE"
1.5,I learned a lot but when it came to tests and assignments she is overly ready to give you an F. She doesn't curve even when only 1 person passes. I ended up withdrawing from this class so I could re-take it with a different professor. Terrible online class. Listen to this review and the other reviews on here. Wait or take another prof.
2,Hard to take as an online class. Did not return emails. Very VERY slow at grading assignments. Assignments are randomly placed throughout the semester. Lets you know AFTER the deadline that the test period has been extended. Not helpful when you ask her questions. I would take another teacher if I had the opportunity to.
1.5,Gives vaugue instructions for the submission of assignments that may appear in vaious places. Will give over half the class a zero if her pet instruction isn't followed. Futhermore  there isn't a clear grading ruprick so you will never know how she will grade. Not a pleasent experience.
5,She's not that bad  her tests are open book.
2,There is no point to listen in class. I took notes and when i took my first test my notes did not help me. I just looked streight out of the book.
1,she is the worst teacher ever!!!! stay very far away. she will not explain anything in class or if you miss. when you ask a question she doesn't exactly answer it. the test are extremly hard even if you go to class. DON'T TAKE IT WILL HURT!!!!
3.5,She isn't extremely clear  but a very nice lady who knows what she is talking about when it comes to business. I would suggest taking her class..or at least Into To BUS
1,DO NOT TAKE!!! OFFERS NO HELP AND HER TESTS ARE NOTHING LIKE WHAT YOU EXPECT!
2,she confuses you when she teaches and her test are not easy & she doesn't like to keep you informed what your work is or what they did in class if you miss a day
2,Very hard  Don't take.

4,This was a good class! I am a veteran typist but really enjoyed the class and learned a lot! I have arthritis but still did well in the class. Professor Moore wasn't my actual instructor  but she wrote the syllabus and information and was helpful when help was needed.
1.5,Assignments are heavy and instructions are walls of text. Exams online are difficult with fill in the blank answers that must be exact. This is a good class if you want to be a secretary  and redundant in Word if you take INFS1010  another required class. This class should focus on typing only. She makes assumptions about disabilities (arthritis).
4,I had her this year for Bus Comm Online  very nice and helpful. The assignments are easy and their are so so so many extra credit quizzes and they have unlimited amount of times you can summit! Would def take her if I could again!
4.5,If you want to learn how to type without looking at your fingers  take this class. You will also learn how to format business documents which should help you in your job. Really good class.
5,If you want to know how to use Word 2010  take this class. Mrs. Moore is great!
5,If you need a refresher in grammar  this is the course for you. There are no prerequisites for this class  but Mrs. Moore does a really good job teaching grammar. I know I needed this class. I recommend it to everyone.
5,Great class! There is a lot of work  but I needed it to learn the skill. Mrs. Moore is very helpful  but you have to meet the deadlines. This is good for me because my job is going to require the same thing.
2.5,Do NOT take this class if it is not required for your degree. There is a rediculous amount of work to complete each week  all very repetitive. Easy work  but takes forever to do and you must have Word 2012 available  the free trial version won't work with the software you have to install.
2,It would be nice if she wouldn't be so relentless about the documents and the grammar. I understand your intent  but this is a typing class... Not an English class... If you wanna teach English maybe you should go back to school T. Moore. Maybe then you'll get what it's like.. I hope you have a teacher just like you  maybe then you'll change.
3.5,The most difficult part of this class is the grammar portion. After being out of school for 20 yrs  the grammar killed me. If the grammar had not been included (difficult when the class is on business communication)I would have made a better grade.Would be better to take while in English or soon after  not 20 yrs later
4.5,Quick paced class  but as long as one does the work  easy to keep up. Hard to catch up (based on work load) if one gets behind. Alot of information in the text to cover. As long as one does the work  not a hard class to pass. VERY informative & helpful if you ask. Patient and willing to help...just ask
5,I TOOK 2 CLASSES WITH MRS. MOORE. INTERMEDIATE KEYBOARDING AND WORD FOR WINDOWS. INT. KEYBOARDING WAS A LOT MORE WORK THAN I EXPECTED. I THOUGHT THE COURSE WOULD BE SPEED DRIVEN BUT IT HAD TONS OF DOCUMENTS TO COMPLETE. MRS. MOORE IS MORE THAN WILLING TO HELP IF YOU JUST ASK. I LEARNED A LOT WITH MRS. MOORE. GREAT PERSONALITY/FUN!
5,Bus 222 under Mrs. Moore is one of the best courses I have ever had. She stresses grammar which is very helpful to me. I learned a lot from her class. Take her if you can!
4.5,Great teacher! Just do your work and an A is easy!
5,Mrs. Moore is a great teacher who knows her subjects and is helpful to all students. She has high expectations of her students  but is clear in these expectations. You have to meet deadlines  but this is great preparation for the future.
5,Mrs. Moore is an excellent teacher. She knows her subjects and is helpful to all. She requires students to do their best and to abide by all deadlines  but that is what real life is like. She does a great job preparing students for their futures.
5,Mrs. Moore is a great teacher! She is always happy too. Keyboarding is a breeze for me. I key apprx. 67 wpm. I'm making an easy A in this class. The assignments are super easy. BUT you have to do them everynight or you will get behind. Just like with any class  study. Tests are easy. Love this teacher. Take her if you can! It's fun.
3,This was the hardest class I have ever taken. The work is not hard or confusing but it takes up hours of your time if you are not an expert typist. I learned alot and studied hard and only ended up with a B.
3,If you have to take her Keyboarding class  don't take the Hybrid class. I thought it would be awesome only meeting once every two weeks  but she isn't clear on how the homework should be turned in. I missed one thing in a Lesson and I received a zero for the whole thing. Very sweet lady...just not right for teaching.
2.5,I wonder if Vol State monitors instructors' teaching methods. Five points off for each mistake--one mistake and you go from an A to a C. If you don't have all the documents turned in  you get a Zero. If you MUST take her class  read the syllabus every week  and take every opportunity for extra credit--you'll need it.
4.5,Ms. Ruttenbur was extremely helpful in class. She made it a priority for all students to participate and grasp the information. She wanted us to learn the material and not simply memorize text.
1,Easy teacher  but absolutely worthless. All work is busy work  and none of it is useful  if you are required to take other business courses you will learn everything you need to know. I would not recommend this professor to anyone interested in learning.
2,Nice lady but doesn't teach anything clearly. Mostly busy work.
5,Prof. Ruttenbur is the bomb! She is fun to be in class with  helps you with anything you need assistance with  and the homework that you DO isn't hard  but is very informative. Recommend her extremely!
4.5,Very helpful and wonderful teacher. I had her for Bus 222 and she teaches other classes as well. Very easy
3,This is only a 900 point class. 600 out of the 900 points are tests. There are 5 test in the semester. If you do not read the book it is hard to make a good grade.
5,This class is so much fun. Dr. Espey wants you to LEARN. Which is (or supposed to) be the point of college. He often tells stories  and makes lessons easily relatable to real life scenarios. Marketing is an interesting field  and he makes it more interesting! Don't listen to people who tell you not to take him. You will learn so much!
2,Hate this professor. I'm a student who loves all my professors. Thought I would've loved him too. He's very tough. Especially with his grading. Took off 8 points because I had a comma in the wrong spot. Doesn't help if you go to him. He told me good luck. Other students have told me the same. He doesn't use technology. Can't read anything he writes
4,"He's very thorough about the text  and he's very entertaining to listen to  but GOD HELP YOU if you miss turning in an assignment at the end of the semester. I turned a few in after finals and it took the guy 3 months to change my ""Incomplete"" to a ""B "" and he only did so after I sicked my advisor on him."
4.5,Mr. Espey is a wonderful teacher. He is friendly  helpful  and always interested in what one has to say. I have enjoyed him so much I am taking a different class with him next semester.
1.5,He is enthusiastic  but he's a ****.
1,No Comments
5,I never can get enough of this class...makes me think about becoming a marketing major...very enthusiastic professor who includes life experiences along with class time. Keeps things moving and has a lot of research based knowledge.
4.5,He is not terribly hard. Very kind and fair in his grading. I took 5 classes this one was my favorite by far. However  this is college so you will have to study!
2,If you want to learn anything to help you in your future Eng 2 class this is not the teacher for you. He rambles on about his life with very little about english itself. His class was useless and I did not learn anything except not to take his class again.
4.5,Very cool. Loved him  so helpful and easy going.
2.5,He is very laid back. If you already know MLA you will find yourself correcting him in your mind. Very minimal class time which is good because he tends to ramble and get off track. All in all  he is very helpful and is available for further questions.
4,Very interesting and laid back. More interested in us writing than lectures.
1.5,If you want to drive all the way to school for nothing  this is the professor to have. We have four grades the entire semester and going to the library is considered class. I also think he is very confusing. It's an easy A  but I consider it a waste of my time.
3.5,I had no clue who this man was  but he turned out a really good teacher. Most of the kids in the class got A's and there is not alot of homework!!!
5,BEST TEACHER EVER!!!. God he's so cool. Easy A every time and such a down to earth old man. I took all my englishes with him and near amazing. Very good teacher and it's so easy!! AWESOME.
4,No Comments
5,She's absolutley amazing!
4.5,she was a good teacher and made thing very clear
5,Professor Powers is the best teacher I have ever had. He LOVES to teach more than anything and you can tell this because of his enthusiasm and love for chemistry! He is an awesome person and does anything to help his students! His organic class is hard but it is the best class I have ever taken! you will love his teaching!
4,This class was super easssssyyyy  but super booooring!.. I could barley stay awake in there. He does not require a lot of work which is great. The professor is very bad with getting you your grades on your work  so you never really know what you have in the class.
4.5,Powers is a really cool professor. He cares about his students. The class didn't hold my interest a lot of the time  but it was extremely easy otherwise. I also learned a lot from the class  though a lot of it was very random and unorganized.
3.5,Ok I will start off saying he is a good teacher and a nice dude but if you arent into Chem I wouldnt take him. He is really hard and yes I ended up with a B but I worked hard for it. He wants to help you and wants you to make a good grade I just think hes too smart to teach kids that arent up to par with him.
3,"Super nice guy and really enjoyed teaching  but I honestly would not recommend him if you are taking more than one class. He gives a rediculous amnt of hmwk and ""runs"" through the math. For someone that hasn't had math or chem in a while  way too difficult to understand."
5,I took his Gen Chem class as a 5 week summer course. He is hands down my favorite instructor I've had. I consider him a lifelong contact and I learned so much from him. He's incredibly easy to talk to about his class  your goals  & your education. This man cares about his students. Chemistry isn't easy so be willing to try  and you'll do just fine.
4,The lecture exams cover at least 3 chapters at a time. The labs are pretty easy and straight forward. He is helpful  but wants you to think for yourself.Do the homework! Ask questions. You can call him  email  or even stop by his office. He will help if you ask for it. It's a tough subject. Practice the math until you have it down.
5,Read  do the homework  show up for lecture/lab  don't miss  & ask questions. Make flashcards  you will need them! Make sure your math skills are at a College Algebra or higher level. Also  beware of spelling errors. He will count you off even though you'll notice he misspells and places commas incorrectly. He's a great teacher though. : )
2,With lot of expectations  i took this class. Mr.Powers covers a whole lot of topics within a short span of time.He covered Ch.14 15 16 17 one day!Even if u study well  his questions are hard.If he should 've given handouts periodically things would've been diff atleast to meHe doesn't've to curve the grades finally.
5,He's a great teacher. Very helpful and attentive. Talks about his son a lot. But really good person. Main thing you gotta take notes and you gotta study. Tons of homework online that takes forever  but the homework is useful. Don't start off the class with a negative mentality. Study all vocabs and all math laws he shows. Great Teacher!
4,The subject was hard for me  but as long as you study  take notes  attend class  and ask him for help  you can do well. He is very willing to help those who ask.
4,I HATED CHEMISTRY..STILL DO. BUT HE MAKES IT AS GOOD AS IT CAN BE. GO TO CLASS..DO NOT MISS. ASK QUESTIONS..VISIT HIS OFFICE..HE WILL HELP THOSE WHO TRY...DO PC HOMEWORK  BE ACTIVE IN LECTURES..HE CARES IF YOU DO. THIS ISNT AN EASY CLASS  ONCE YOU KNOW THAT..PREPARE AND TRANSCEND. DO NOT MISS CLASS. HAD HIM FOR LAB.THE SAME SENTIMENTS. MY GRADE B
5,Powers is a wonderful teacher. The class is very difficult  but he makes it easier. I would def take him again if I need more chemistry.
5,Great professor! He was my favorite chemistry teacher. He is very clear and helpful. I would def take him again if I needed to take organic as I had him also for General Chemistry. I got an A
5,Parris Powers is great. He actually cares about his students and wants them to succeed. He is always willing to help. Feel free to stop by his office  it does wonders. Chemistry is hard  no doubt  but his method of teaching is very down to earth and easy to comprehend. I was scared to death about taking Chemistry and made an A in his class.
3.5,Mr. Powers is very intimidating! Now that I have been in class awhile  I see that he is very helpful. His tests are very hard! He loves Chemistry and it shows!
5,I was scared to death of Chemistry before taking this class. Mr. Powers is awesome and one of the best teachers I have had so far. He makes it interesting and makes a hard subject easy to learn. He will explain until we understand and opens up for questions. I highly recommend him for Fundamentals of Chemistry.
4.5,He is so helpful and informative. Sometimes the lectures blow you away  but he is so full of information. The labs are super easy but really helpful. His tests are extremely hard and DO pay attention to definitions because they are on the test. If you want to learn Chemistry and have it stick with you  take this guy.
4.5,Hard to read this guy  he's nice one day and very serious and non-joking the next. Overall I would say he knows his stuff. Alot of things on the test are very misleading  so be sure to study outside of the notes and pay attention to definitions.
4.5,Awesome teacher and hallarious. His tests are a shot in the dark though and you have no idea how he's going to grade that night... His labs are a gimmie which is helpful. The tests are tough though so prepare to study. The chem department at VSCC is NOT a joke... Much harder than MTSU  trust me... I know :)
3,He is very hard to follow. He gives a lot of in class examples on the day the material is introduced  but doesnt do much review before the test. I probably wouldnt take another one of his classes. He is very nice though.
3.5,While he is a smart professor  he is very difficult to understand. He doesn't review with us over our material but will tell us to just study over the chapters instead. I wouldn't personally take him again as some of the other professors were much easier to work with for assistance.
1,BAD TEACHER
3.5,I took Neilan for Fundamentals of Chemistry and he is an incredibly helpful teacher  but a lot of his exams are extremely tricky. Be prepared to study enough a few days before the exam to fully comprehend the material. On the bright side he is extremely nice  laid back  and approachable for any questions you have. He does what he can to help.
2.5,He is a good professor if you go to his class everyday and ask questions. I went to his tutor classes and those did not help me. His tests you really need to study for  and you never really know what is going to be on them. A lot of them seem like trick questions
5,I loved his class! This class was my first chemistry class ever  he made it a great experience. He is very helpful if you don't understand the material  he will help you! pay attention  take lots of notes  ask questions  read the material  take notes  and do the homework. He gives extra credit during the semester  so do it. Great professor!
2.5,Nice guy. Very smart. But should not teach. He knows chemistry but he teaches like he is at yale and is crazy hard to understand  and when you get your test back it looks like it has been through battle with all of the red on it. I have nothing against him like I said he is extremely smart  just cant teach or relate his knowledge to students.
4.5,Dr. Neilan is a fantastic teacher and anyone who disagrees doesn't care about putting forth effort. Organic is a HARD class but he will do what it takes to make sure you get it. He truly cares about his students as well and takes time to let you know he appreciates your hard work. He's funny  helpful  and his class has been a wonderful experience.
2,Mr. Neilan is a a very nice professor if you attend class every day and he sees that you are making a effort. He is NOT good at rephrasing how to do a particular aspect such as math in a different way  if you do not get it the way he teaches your pretty much out of luck. He trys to be involved in helping you but he cant explain things differently.
5,Dr.Neilan is a grt instructor with a grt wealth of knowledge.Very down to earth though.always respond to ur emails.I had him fr lab & he was very helpful.i missed the opp. to take him for lecture.
3,Mr. Neilan is a good teacher. He's NOT easy. You have to study and pay attention. He expects YOU to study  and hard. He doesn't tell you what will be on the test  but he will hint at it. He's really funny  and cares about you learning. I would recommend him for someone who wants to really wants to LEARN chemistry! He knows his stuff  and you can te
1.5,Do not take this guy for chemistry! Warning! You will not pass.
1.5,He would not answer questions  he would make you guess and feel dumb for asking the question. Did not offer any extra credit to help reach your goal. I studied for hours outside of class and could not make above a C on his test. They are HARD.
4.5,Nice teacher  VERY SMART! Knows chemistry extrememly well. He is NOT an easy teacher. Some people have said you have to do extra work to get an A. THATS exactly Right!! You need to be there everyday  take lots of notes  and study alot to pass. Not a just go to class and do work and pass. Heard other chem teachers are way easier! especially in lab.
3,I had him for chem 1. hes alright. his teaching methods are kind of confusing. he gives multiple choice quizzes  which is helpful at times. although  i myself  didnt do very well. i think that if you pay very close attention to the first few chapters then the general material will begin to make sense. hes also got an extremely northern accent. :)
4,I really enjoyed having Mr. Neilan as my professor. He is a sweet man. He knows his stuff and will help you as much as you need. just ask. The class isnt easy but if you study  do the recommended work  and pay attention in class you will do fine. He really likes to make the class interesting and keep the class involved.
3.5,his class isn't so bad  but his tests are difficult. If you dont work outside of class on it  you won't pass. DO THE EXTRA PROBLEMS! if you want to pass
4.5,He is brilliant in his field and an excellent professor who is more than willing to help. I had him for lab and he was easier than Dr. Snelling in lab. The only problem is he is slightly difficult to understand due to his Bostonian accent. My major is Chemistry so I understood it well. Take him if you can.
4.5,"Mr. Neilin is a good teacher to take fundmentals of chem from.He gets poeple involved in class and he gives lots of handouts.I am a person that learns best by interacting  reading the book and doing extra homework.This teacher is extreamly patient if you ask ""dumb"" questions and will help you after class.Take him if you are a thourough learning typ"
2,I hate it when teachers are so anal about their time schedule they never review for the test  which is always on Monday to ruin your weekend. Before a big test we finish the chapters ahead of schedule and he went right into the some god awful chapter that's not even on the test. HOW ABOUT A REVIEW OR ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS WE MIGHT HAVE!
5,Best Class ever! I enjoyed the way Professor Jasek-Rysdahl taught the class. He made economics easy to understand. If you pay attention and do the study guide then you won't have trouble passing the exams.
4,His class was really great. His lectures were really interesting and he used recent events so you can relate. If you do all the homework and do alright on the test then you'll pass. The homework is extremely easy. Attendance isn't mandatory  but you do group work in class somewhat often.
5,I enjoyed the way he lectured  but you really have to work for your grade in this class. I recommend you to print the notes out and just fill in the blanks. There was a weekly online hw and quiz  but they were usually pretty easy. Just as long as you put some effort into studying for the exam  you'll do fine.
5,Best class ever  I just took this class to fill some of G.E credit but it was more than what I expected. You have to take notes or printed them out  you also have online quizzes and hw (easy)  and some problems sets. The tests are multiple choice and also short answer questions. I really recommend this class.
4,If you just go to the lecture  take very good notes  and do the study guide  you will pass. His lectures are clear and understandable. He gives current examples to allow the student to understand the topic at hand. Homework  quizzes  and in class work are given. Tests are mainly multiple choice but problem sets are also included.
5,Take the online class if econ is one of your pre-req. His collaborate sessions are very helpful  he is always available via email  has so far given so many quizzes  more opportunities to redeem your grade.Good class I learned a lot. Take it if your interested in learning and it will not be a major burden in your life.
5,Awesome professor! Very clear lectures. Understands students and goes out of his way to help. Answers questions and helps with assignments if you go to his office hours.
5,Professor Rysdahl is a great professor. Takes a subject most dont care about and brings it to the maximum of relevance. Got 3 on easiness cause of material  not him. Take him  you'll learn so much in his class.
2,Attend class to take notes. Expect him to give favoritism to certain students by spending more time with them during in-class work. He will also talk about his own students to other faculty members in hopes that it will affect treatment of certain students by faculty. Expect tension between students when taking his course bc of this. Avoid him!
5,He is an awesome economics teacher! I am taking another class next semester!:)
2.5,His notes are not hard to follow. It would be nice if his feedback was more direct than indirect in grading assignments. When it comes time to take tests  it's more frustrating to put down answers than it is about doing exams because the questions don't seem to be clear about what he is asking.
5,BEST ECONOMICS PROFESSOR AT STANISLAUS!! Probably best teacher I've had over all. Took him for macro & micro. He's awesome!
5,Memorizes every students name
3,This guy should be in research for a wal-mart stores.Very hard  and worthles lecture spent on graphing  graohing and graphing .
3,Very hard .long tests  too many in class assignments and home assignments .not recommended
4,he is hard.. but very helpful.. if you want the grade.. you have to earn it!
3,I agree  he is very hard  most of the time is wasted on graphs and not lecture from the text .Very hard and complicated .
3,Very Very Hard .His time is spent on learning to graph demand .Too many assignments and the final is really hard .Not recomended .
3,Extremely hard .Too many papers  assignments in class assignments .Too much materials covered for a 3 unit class .
4.5,He is very clear teacher. His tests are hard especially the final. It wasn't cumulative but it was EXTREMELY hard. He is willing to help which is very nice. You can take your papers in and have him look at them and he will grade them before you turn them in and give them back to you to correct. I would recommend him for anyone.
5,Best teacher i have ever had! loved his classes more then other i took. RIP Jim  you will be missed greatly.
3,The late professor Curtis has interesting lectures  but the DE course is on cruise-control now. There's almost no interaction  feedback  or help. Test/exam questions are based almost entirely on the text. Print out your tests because half the questions reappear on the final exam.
5,Prof. Curtis was an intelligent and truly selfless man. He was extremely laid back and unassuming. I'm so glad I got a chance to have him as a teacher.
5,Prof. Curtis was an absolutely incredoble teacher. He cared so much for his students and was always willing to help. His loss will be deeply felt by all. We'll miss you Prof. Curtis!
5,easy  fun and great
5,very good prof.. puts interest of students at the top. Does not lie about his exams  very easy.. just study the text and go to his lectures. Willing to help at any time and clarify things if needed  very considerate and nice.. approachable too  take his class as elective..you'll definitely enjoy it
5,Great prof! Cares so much for his students and is so nice to everyone! Exams aren't bad at all  however Sociology is a very boring subject!
5,Jim Curtis is a teaching God and his son is very sexy.
5,Jim Curtis is a great prof. Distance Ed was great I didn't listen to any of the lectures yet I still got an A.
4,Good course! Not terribly difficult. Just make sure if you take the DE course  you know the assignments really well for your final. And don't bother with the lecture notes too much. Prof won't give any answers away  but still very helpfuL!
4.5,Really super nice guy  likes to teach  and is there to help you out in any way he can. Very helpful if you have a problem in the course. Course is interesting  readings are fairly easy.
5,No Comments
4,boring class  but really easy
4.5,Easy course  Wants students to do well. Classes are kinda boaring. Most of the test questions come from the textbook. He looks like Santa
5,Amazing Prof  great class. If it wasn't for him  I wouldn't have decided to major in sociology. Wish he taught more classes.
4.5,Easy course  don't bother too much with the tapes. Read the text  and practice with assignments. Exam is all the assignments put together.
1.5,TOok distance ed course - SO boring. I didn't listen to the lectures b/c they put my to sleep. He NEVER got back to me about any of my questions  and all his supplementary material was VERY out of date.
4,Interesting lectures  but not nessisarily exciting. Read your text  or you're doomed on the exams.
4.5,Extremely nice and helpful pro.!
5,Loved doing his distance ed course! He was very clear and enjoyable to listen to. The assignments and exams were reasonable and clear. Highly recommend!! A+++
3.5,Great personality  little confused sometimes. overall okay
5,She is very kind  although hard to understand. Has a great grading scale and gave extra credit very often in lectures. Will stay after and help you comprehend.
2.5,I had her from lab  the first day or so it was hard to understand her. She does yell when she talks and is hard to read. She grades hard on her labs but if you copy the problems word for word you will get a 100 on them all. Do not miss a lab if you intend to pass.
1,Her accent makes it very hard for her students to understand her. she yells when she talks so it makes it worse. She always seems to be in a bad mood. She gets irritated when you ask questions. She also rushes you to finsh your lab. I would not recommend taking her for Chemistry 1030-LAB!
2,This teacher has a very thick accent creating a language barier with her studens. She is easily frustrated when a student doesn't understand her. i do not recommened taking Organic Chem 1 with her over the summer!!! it is a nightmare
1,I don't reccoment this teacher. Her accent makes communication difficult. The first half of the semester she showed films of someone else lecturing from our book. The second half she she lectured for 10 min before busy work. She yells if you don't understand not works with you. Also  expects you to know material before its covered in class! boo!!!
1,If you like science and know it well  take her. if not  don't. She is fair with grading but her tests are difficult and she does not have patience with those who don't catch on quick. science is not my subject and she made me feel really dumb by acting as if it was so simple and that I should have already known it all.Plus she has a rly thick accen
1,Will never take her again!! She is not helpful.. if you do not understand she will raise her voice  like her getting louder will help one to understand better. Her test are very hard  I am pretty sure that she picks the hardest problem possible to give to you  just to try and make you fail. Over all I don't like her.
4.5,WILL TAKE HER AGAIN!!! DROPPED LOWEST TEST SCORE AND LAB PLUS CURVED THE TEST GRADES. VERY HELPFUL CAN ASK ANY QUESTIONS AS MANY TIMES AS NEEDED. SHE MAKES CHEMISTRY EASY.
4,She was very easy and very lenient with grading EVERYTHING. Even on our tests she added 20 points one time. I am taking her again in the fall for chemistry
4,she is awesome! i have alot of trouble with science and she made is fun and easy. She gives zero homework and its all done in class. plus the homework in class is the same as the test so just study a few min and an easy A TAKE HER!!!
3,The world of chemistry comes easy to Ms. Hunter and she give the impression that it should come easy to everyone. She is fair to students but has little patience if you don't understand what she is explaining or if you are taking too long in lab. For someone who is starting back to college after 20+ years out  she's a tough teacher to start off w/
3,she didnt teach much. most of the class was spent watching a video or going through powerpoints  then gave an in-class assignment based on them. tests were the EXACT same questions as on the homework  so just memorize them and you should get an easy A on the exams. also allowed us to skip the final if we did well on the first 2 tests. take for ez A
4,This teacher was helpful and pretty easy. I took her for Chem lab and got an A in the lab. Science is my worst subject but she got me through it.
4.5,I heard she would be a difficult teacher  but I found her to be quite helpful and learned many things in her class.
1,o.k ....wow! I've never laughed more in class as I did in her class and mostly out of insanity! she is so not good teacher! she's nice  eventually  but she's really hard! The only reason she will let up on the assignments is if she thinks she's in a class of idiots.... take her as a last resort! She's also reallllllly hard to understand!
1,THIS WAS AN AWFUL TEACHER  SHE WAS COMPLETLY UNHELPFUL AND HER TESTS WERE VERY HARD I DO NOT RECOMEND ANYONE TO TAKE HER CLASS
1,No Comments
4.5,Easy Class. Make sure you don't skip it  attendance is important. Other than that its a very relax atmosphere.
2,If you want a teacher that actually teaches--DON'T TAKE HIM! He's confusing. He makes you take tests that he doesn't cover. Better have a photographic memory. Beware that he does require attendance. Miss 2 classes and a whole grade is deducted! You better be an energetic speaker or you're screwed.
2.5,"I took his night class that was held on Mondays @ 6. It was a good class. He doesn't ""actually"" teach. However  I did not mind that at all. In fact  much of his class was straight to the point. You hear a small number of speakers  watch some movies  take 3 quizzes and 1 final exam"
4,I took his speech class and I loved him! If you have any brain you should make an A. He's not a tough grader on the speeches because he understands that people are naturally better or worse speakers. You ARE on your own with the test because he doesn't cover anything in the book. Just read the chapters it's over and you'll do fine!
4,Just talk for the time he wants you to and do your outlines and speaker critiques and youll be good! Really easy and laid back. Watched a lot of movies
2.5,Great guy! If you aren't a smart ass  you'll get along with him just fine!
2,He doesnt not teach at all  all he does is give speeches and they are due the next class meeting
3,I did well. I do not even know if he has a text book but he will give test on it 3 test the test are the same amount of points as the speeches. He will explain the speeches but the test you are on your own.
4,I was DREADING taking this class  but Mr. Jobe makes it easy! He explains what he wants out of a speech  but other than that he lets students be as open as they want to be. It was very entertaining!! I learned a lot through my peers and material I did speeches on. Make sure you come to class and act like you have some sense..it will be an A!
5,Professor Jobe is great. It is a communcation/speech class. So no he doesnt speak often  but the point is for you too. If you are an intelligent person  you will enjoy his class. You do need to study on your own  but this is college  not highschool. I was nervous to speak and his class helped me greatly. Take him if you need this class.
2,"He's unfair ie speeches ran late 1 day & he said me & others would go next class-so we all do & he knocked 10 points off for ""Being late""!!Hes overly unfair about attndnce too. Tests are xtrmly difficult due to him never reviewing. Get ready do all the speaking too  students had to do more speaking than he did. How bout earning your paycheck Mr. J?"
3.5,i do agree that he did not really ever go over anything in the book  and then his tests were based solely on the book. extremely difficult not knowing what to look for to study. HOWEVER  most of the semester is spent on obtaining actual speech experience. expect to spend a lot of time in front of the class  talking. pretty good teacher though :) :)
4,I would reccomend him for anyone. If you pay attention you will see the big picture of his class. I learned alot of life lessons. I would take him again if I had the chance
4.5,he was super nice! easy class!! as of work you have three tests & maybe 6 or 7 speeches that usually have to be 3 to 5 mins long but most of the time i was like 2 minutes and still got an A! i recommend taking him...his class was also fun!
4.5,His class was very easy. He passed people who had really bad speeches. We watched alot of movies and wasted time to get an A.
4,VERY EASY  but bad sense of humor and does not go over the material  but 80% of your grade is on the speeches themselves anyway
2,This class was easy. Intresting speech topics. did not go over chpt's in class but very easy tests. Nice guy.
1,this is my second time taking his class not becuz i didn't pay attention or becuz i didn't show up or becuz i blew on the speeches but becuz i bombed the final cuz he went over ABSOLUTELY nothing that was on it. And he has a very dry sence of humor
1,He gives tests over 6 chapters at a time and never tells us what is on the test. He does have an alright sence of humor at times but it would be nice to get some help on the class work sometimes.
5,She was one of the best teachers I have had in a long time. I really appreciated how she gives you an assignment schedule. You will do very well if you read the chapters and DO NOT PROCRASTINATE. seriously. When you get to midsemester things really start to move quickly.
4,Gaines was a good teacher. she really cares about her job  and she interacts with the students well. at times her lectures and classes can be entertaining. i had her for speech communications and the speeches we had to do were not that bad. her tests are not that hard  although sometimes they can be a little tricky. i would reccommend her.
5,I throughly enjoyed her class  it was the easiest one I took all semester . She is an excellent teacher and makes things fairly interesting
5,She was a very nice and helpful teacher. I would recomend her class to everyone. Her class was not difficult and took almost no study time. Yea for learning.
5,He was the best teacher i ever had. He was hard but a really fun teacher and would help u out if you need it.
5,Mr. English was a great teacher. The class is intimidating at first  but he teaches it well and gives sufficient time to prepare speaches.. Be prepared for a couple 8 minute speeches toward the end though!
3,Assante's lectures are basically the reading assignments regurgitated. Sometimes  he'll add a few videos  fun facts  and personal stories to make them not too boring. His quizzes aren't too hard  but his tests can be tricky. He offers a lot of extra credit questions and makes his own memes though.
4,Took this online over the 10 week summer. At first I would read the book and then take the test and would do poorly. After that I just started to look the quizzes up on Quizlet. One group project  which wasn't hard at all and their was a storytelling speech and a informative speech. For the informative speech you have to have 5 audience members.
4,Great at relating all topics in class and is interesting in his lectures. Read the textbook for tests though!
4.5,Mr. Assante is very clear about what he expects in the 5 speeches that you give over the semester. Hes a very good speaker and even gave us a great motivational speech at the beginning of class.
4,Mr. Assante Gives very interesting lectures and explains topics well. He has an easy-going personality and is willing to work with you. In my public speaking class  the three big things he expected of us when giving a speech is keep it simple  clean  and have your audience in mind.
5,I enjoyed Len's class. He was very helpful during the semester and I learned more than I thought I would.
4.5,One of my favorite classes at Vol State!!! I took his Interpersonal Communication class as an elective  and I LOVED it! He keeps the subject interesting and I LOVE his style of teaching! He can be a little sarcastic every now and then  but he's still very nice and a very good teacher! I would suggest taking him to anyone! :)
4,"This guy is really cool. As long as you do the assignments  you will have no trouble making an ""A."" He lets you take the quizzes up to three times each  and you only do 2 speeches. Enjoy!"
3,He was cool  until the end of the semester  when he started giving everybody bad grades for no reason. Group project was terrible. Take this class in person if ya can
5,THIS GUY IS TOO COOL! 15 EASY QUIZZES  3 EASY EXAMS  2 EASY SPEECHES AND 1 GROUP PROJECT(THIS IS THE HARDEST PART  BECAUSE OF ALL THE DIMWITS ASSIGNED IN UR GROUP). DON'T NEED TO BUY THE NEW EDITION BOOK EITHER. EASY A!
3.5,I took his online class. This teacher is GREAT!!! He is very nice and understanding!!!! I would take him again anyday!!!
5,I took his online Comm. class and it was great. Everything is very organized with lots of details so it is very easy to see what you will be doing. He gives weekly quizzes but you can take them up to 4 times to get the best grade possible. A few assignments here and there and 2 big speeches that you must do. Great class  great teacher!
5,Mmmmmmm  He is hot!!! Fun  interesting and easy class.
3,"Mr. Lyn is nice  but he is soooooooo liberal. It is very annoying. He is a democrat and wants to convert you into one. Just read his crazy bulletin board outside of his office. His office has the sti ""Always question Authority"". Watch out keep your head on and don't be converted into a person that is so open minded your brains fall comepletely out."
5,Awesome guy!!! Great teacher!!! I dreaded this subject and he actually made it fun!!! Take him.
2.5,took online class - didnt really participate in online discussions. only came on and did grades. took a while to answer emails  so the class ran itself. 2 speeches required with at least 6 witnesses  and a group project.
5,Very straight-forward  knowledgeable  and clear on the subject matter.
4.5,No Comments
4,I took him a couple of semesters back for the video class. A lot of homework but he worked around my traveling which is always a plus in my book. I am glad I didn't get hit on though. My it is better if girls take the video class instead.
4,a great teacher  love him
1,Horrible teacher
3,Yes  she IS very knowledgable  however is also condescending at times  is known for embarrasing students in front of entire class  and I wrote more essays in her communication class than I did in BOTH of my Eng. classes.. Would NOT recommend her. She teaches communications  but does NOT communicate!! How does that work?
4.5,She was my fist teacher in almost ten years. It was a pleasure to have her introduce me into the world of college. She is kind funny and very helpfull. She is very understanding and willing to help in anyway. As long as you do what she asks it's a fun class.
3.5,Very knowledgeable  very professional  but killed us with the amount of homework
5,Great
4.5,This was a fun class. Mr. Warner is a very animated person and clearly loves to teach. I found myself cracking up quite a bit during his lectures and feeling very open in his class. He is also extremely helpful with speech topics and emphasizes on wanting students to approach him with any questions  comments  or concerns they may have.
4.5,"Personality PLUS! Loved this guy! You must use the book as the test materials are not all covered in class  but all test questions are covered in the sample quizzes. ""Written Set"" assignments do not always make sense  but if you ask him he'll clarify. He built our class into a great team! Thought I'd hate the class. Wrong."
3.5,I found him to be very animated and entertaining. Show up for class. participate  and take the online practice quizzes before his tests and you will do fine in his class. The one negative I had with him is all his examples are church related so if your not a Christian his examples wont make sense to you. Ask the right questions to get around that.
2,Mr. Warner is not very clear on what exactly he wants on many assignments. It seems like it's just hit or miss as to whether or not you happen to respond the way he wants on the sets he assigns with questions and answers. It's not a super difficult class. Some said all you have to do is the work and you will receive an A  but I disagree. Need book
5,LOVED him! He is a HUGE county guy!! and he is probably one of the most silliest guys in the world! his class was more like high school  eveyone got to know one another and him as well! Loved the atmosphere! but the test are kinda hard! He is for sure a great teacher!
5,He is awesome!! Study your practice quizzes online and you've aced the test! I really liked the book we used in class and Warner is super animated. I would recommend him to anyone! Great teacher.
5,Great teacher. Quizzes are from samples he gives beforehand. Two speeches which he gives great preparation beforehand. His entire class is mapped out for you in contents and you can work ahead on some things. Learned loads.
1.5,Easy A if u study for tests/do homework/some instructon confusing/didn't learn anything except from what read in the book/Felt very unprepared to give speeches b/c we didn't spend ANYTIME preparing 4 them.WARNING he makes you go to the library to take your tests/turn in homework if you are taking a hybrid to save trips to the school don't take him
4.5,Dr. Warner will give you all of the information you need to pass his class with a good grade. You will need to prepare for his tests but he gives study questions with answers in advance. Prepare to give 5 speeches during the semester.
3,I think he's annoying. He can go from laughing hysterically one minute to mad and pissed the next. The course is easy but at lot of his instruction is unclear and contradictory.
5,Oh my goodness! If you don't get an A in this class you have no one to blame but yourself!! He is enthusiastic about the material and knows his stuff. Everything is very clear about what is expected and when--all you have to do is do it! Online practice quizzes make tests easy. I recommend him to everyone!
5,he is awesome!
4.5,He is a great teacher! if you have questions he is easy to approach. his tests are good and his class is great! that is saying a lot since i had him for an 8 o'clock class
5,D. Warner is a great guy. He tries his best to stay connected with students generation. Very helpful and tells you on day one what to do to pass his class. Easy assignments  very fair. And very entertaining... he makes jokes and you can joke back... he loves and welcomes the interaction. Anamated too.
5,DW was a great teacher. He made most of the lecture interesting to listen to. Sometimes he would make the assignment seem harder then it really was. If you're not a linear thinking type of person the class will be a little harder  but hey  I still got a B.
5,Always helpful
5,He is a very good teacher. He really helped me prepare for my speeches. I would take him again.
3.5,Professor warner was great as a person  however we spent the first 3 to 4 weeks in class going over how to post a BULLETIN! I dont like when teachers waste time on meaningless things such as this. He was always very helpful though in being clear about assignments and what needed to be studied for test.
5,I love Mr. Warner!!! You MUST take him. He wants his students to do well. He gives every opportunity to make good grades. We even go over homework every class time so we'll do the right thing. All I've gotten are A+s in his class. You must take him!!! He is very nice and welcoming. You can totally tell he likes what he does!!!!!! Take Mr. Warner!
2,A joke of a teacher. I didnt appreciate him  and in a classroom setting he is awful.
5,The coolest teacher I have ever had! Everyone should take at least one of his classes!
5,Great Professor! Took this class online and it was very easy. You video tape your speeches with an audience of at least 5-7 people. He grades fair also. Would definitely recommend!!!
5,Took this class (Speech) online  and Professor Sparkman was great! He was very thorough with his directions and/or was glad to assist if needed.
4.5,Great class. Mr. Sparkman is very flexible.
2.5,Make sure you show up to class or you will fail. He isn't always clear on what he's looking for on tests  so make sure you pay close attention and take notes. The way he grades is very un-organized so ask him frequently or he won't tell you but maybe once or twice. With the book you only need it for a list of definitions for one test ONLY. 4 tests
1.5,His class made me angry. He wandered off topic a lot. You didn't even have to show up to know what was going on. He barely paid attention to the students. He often asked our opinions just to interrupt us  tell us we were wrong  then move on to the next opinion. He was rude and made me not want to go into Mass Communications.
5,Wow  what can be said about Mr. E? World's greatest professor. He and I are good friends  and I still deejay at WVCP.
3,Mr. E is a good teacher  but I worked very hard and thought I had an easy A. All of the exam etc. I had A's. It was to my surprise that my final grade for the semester was a B. I was shocked! I wanted to contact him to find out what happened  but I have to take him this semester so I let it go. But his class ruined my 4.0. :( His mouth does cuss 2.
2.5,easy class. he really didn't do much. we did not use the book much and he went over whatever would be on tests. grades easy on speeches as long as you act like you care and seem like you are halfway prepared. he expresses his liberal political views in class which got on my nerves along with the inappropriate language.
4.5,Very cool guy Mr E. is the man...
5,Mr. E is the best!
5,No Comments
5,Mr. E rocks. He will do anything for you if you ask...except let you bring a drink (even if it is closed) into the studio. We had a blast in his class.
5,Mr. E is one of the greatest teachers i've every had anywhere. Will bend over backwards to help you if he can.

2,Dr. Larsen knows her theater
3,I had her for American Popular Culture. She expects a lot  but really enjoys what she does and you learn a lot. Make sure you clarify what is on the syllabus  though.
1,AVOID! Save yourself go to film. This teacher is rude and thinks that her class is the only one you will be taking this semester.I have a 3.5 GPA and Got a D in this class. I have written five papers and all of them are over 1500 words my final is 10 pages anything less will result in a zero.
5,She does make you do a lot of papers  but that's what college is all about. You have to do a lot of reading  but there again that's what college is all about. If you need help she will help you. She gives extra credit. She is a cool person  not stuck up or anal at all. She is very in to what she does  theatre.
1.5,This teacher thinks that theater is everyone's major and expects you to write a 10 page play or perform a part of a play (including costumes and more than one actor) as your final project. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!
3,No Comments
1,this lady is CRAZY!! She can go off on some interesting subjects( she's the rebel of the school! ) i'm not kidding. It was VERY difficult to get an 'a' in her class  the assigments were confusing  I was never really clear on what she really wanted. You ha
4.5,Challenging class  only because she's so passionate about Theater and wants you to at least appreciate it. Also wants you to write like a college student
4.5,Challenging class  only because she's so passionate about Theater and wants you to at least appreciate it. Also wants you to write like a college student
1.5,Dr. Larsen is all about herself. I took her for intro. to theatre and I thought that I was a theatre major by the time I was finished with her papers and plays. She told me that i would end up with a c- and I recieved a d-. she chooses her favirote's in her class.she is knowledgeable about theatre  but she is an awful instructor.
1.5,Not clear on what she is looking for on major assignments & papers
1.5,professor is clearly knowledgable and enthusiastic about subject. however  far too much emphasis was placed on writing for an intro class. grading seemed entirely subjective. i received b's on all papers  not a's  even though she would not tell me at all what to do better and what i did wrong.
1,she is a really bad teacher. her class is not interesting at all. take at your own risk!!!
4,No Comments
5,Very good to give individual help when needed. Very interesting person and a very good teaching technique. Two thumbs up!
5,Lots of fun  very helpful. Has lots of good stories! I've had him for string ped and theory.
4.5,She is a very sweet  and helpful teacher. She reads the chapter with the class for every chapter  and lets you work together on most of the chapter test. Really not a hard class if you just read. Loved her would recommend to anyone.
5,I had her for College Success. She is a great professor. She cares about her students. She does give a lot of busy work but it is not hard. We had to give 3 or 4 presentations during the semester. All quizzes were open book. I enjoyed this class. Got an A.
4,Ms.Hargrove is really cool. She is very nice but I think she requires too much busy work. She told us we would only have 1 presention and we had to do 3 throughout the semester.
5,This is a good class. She's understanding and real laid back.
5,She give alot of homework but she made our class very enjoyable
1,She is horrible!! Please do NOT take her!!! She makes you take tests over 6 chapters and you have to have a passport which is money down the drain!!! So many people dropped the class and failed!!!!!
1,She was a horrible teacher and always gave too much work and reading passport and 6 chapters at a time for a test. She is horrible
2.5,I made an A in her class. As long as you try  she will help you.She does not like you coming into her class late.
1,she just gets really worked up on questions you ask and she is a very hard grader on essays and that class is all essay pretty much. cant ask for help without her getting worked up
5,Good instructor. Really works with you if you don't understand materials. Tries to be fair and helpful.
4.5,Very helpful  keeps up with what you are doing and works with you.
1,No Comments
1,Her tests cover a lot of material  and she allows no additional resources. Those who have a good understanding of Algebra would probably do okay in this class  but If you struggled with Algebra at all in high school do not take her online. I have done fine in the other Math courses I have taken  but this class was too much ( I work full-time).
1,I could imagine this class being difficult for those who struggle with math.
4,Ms. Lester helped me test out of learning support classes  through the Summer Bridge program. She's a very nice lady and a very clear teacher. She can come off as rude or condescending but  honestly I don't think she means too.
3.5,I hardly ever went to class and still made an A. She kind of makes you feel stupid when asking a question  but she will answer it. She really knows her stuff and is very good at explaining things. I like math  and I really did enjoy her class... the few times that I went.
2.5,Do not take this class if you want to be interrupted during a question  learn more from doing the homework online than the teacher. We never used book  except for on the homework theres a few questions that are about the section but theyre no biggie. Not a fun class. If youre someone who likes to do activities  find another class.
1,i won't suggest her to anyone who wants to succeed in Math 1130
1.5,Rude condesending  and not helpful at all. I would not suggest this proffesor to anyone who actually needs a teacher to teach them.
3.5,She's easy enough to understand if you pay attention to her example but has an attitude when students ask questions. Doesn't allow them to finish the question. Makes them feel stupid with her tone so they don't want to elaborate on what they are actually confused on. If math doesn't come easily to you I'd recommend a different instructor.
2,Mrs.Lester is not very helpful at all. I do not recommend her especially if math is not your strong point.
2,Although she is full of knowledge' Professor Lester allows her attitude dominate infact intimedate the majority of students
5,Ms. Lester is a great teacher!! Math isn't my favortie   but she explains it so you can understand. She's not a mean teacher she just doesn't take mess from students who don't want to learn and apply themseleves. HATES TEXTING!! Makes you get on the board sometimes  but she is a wonderful instructor and will help you. I would take her again :)
3.5,She was a really great teacher. I am not good at math and I hate the math lab program  but she taught very well.
4.5,Took the time to make sure everyone understands. speaks slowly and concisely so that you have time to absorb the information. Got an A without any problems.
3.5,Took this class during the summer and would not recommend you do the same unless you are willing to work hard. She used mymathlab for homework and quizzes. Plan on doing lots of busy work online  however it really helps you learn algebra. If you work hard  show up and don't text in class you will make it.
3,ok at first she was an ok teacher  then towards the end she took a turn for the worse. I finished with a 72 (which is failing) and I was 3 pts away from passing but she is not willing to help me. so I am failing and I am having to take this class AGAIN this summer.
5,she is very helpful. if you need help she is willing. you get a 100 on homework as long as you do them.
3.5,uses my math lab so if you dont have alot of spare time do not take.she is a very good teacher. she hates people who are slackers  sleeps in class or texts in class.if you dont do that then you should be fine!!
2.5,You can go never go to this class a day in your life and you'll be just the same. she uses my mathlab which i found to be very annoying. i spent 44 hours on homework in the semester which only accounts for 10% of your overall grade. i spent another 11 hours on quizzes which are 20% of your grade so unless you have a ton of time i wouldnt take her.
2,She was okay teacher  she didn't do well in teaching the math. She would get attitudes at times and I got a C in that class  even after to doing good on all my test and homework...Don't recommend her.
3,I love Ms. Lester and all things she thought me. However  I believe she could be a lil more explanatory and lil bit easier test....but over she was a good teacher
5,Had a blast in his course! The course was well structured. He was passionate about teaching  and cared a lot about the students. Unfortunatly  this was his last year at UW!!!
4,Great prof. The material is lengthy but easy. Don't leave the studying to the end  it is alot to cover!
5,Wayne was such a great prof...he had no patience for stupidity and made sure to help students any way possible  such as by posting notes on teh internet or providing clarification. The assignments are easy if you read the text. Very Informative  I just wish he told off the morons in class.
4,Amazing professor! Always willing to help and really cares about his students! The lectures are really interesting and entertaining (hes a bouncy professor)  I'd definatly take another class he teaches.
3.5,if you're interested in plants  agriculture  pigs  cows and chickens  then take this course. assignments are long but marked pretty easily. no midterm  exam is not bad. interesting  but can sometimes completely lose you.
5,Man this guy is BORING...his classes are simple. Very judgemental if your not a biology major. THinks your a waste of space unless you have a major.
5,Awesome guy  a good teacher  and an entertaining one too (he loves to bounce around up front!). He's very intelligent and insignful  and very helpful. A fair marker too.
5,Great professor. Good guy. Biology 112 was very easy and he made it very entertaining i never missed a lecture.
4.5,Really  really  really cares about his students. Always available for help. Learns student names and can actually remember how you did on tests and assignments. One of the best!
5,very nice man  although the lecture is some what boring however he explains very well
5,Great prof  very nice!
4.5,No Comments
5,nicest man EVER  pretty easy too...
4.5,Entertaining
3,nice guy  but very redundant
5,Great guy! really cares about students learning. I have always struggled in math until now. Very funny and easy on the eyes. Great smile. Wish I could take more classes from him.
5,This guy is hilarious! I just finished a semester with him. I wish he taught the next course of math I have to take.
5,I bet the previous post is from the girl who had already failed his class once and probably failed again. He was without question the best math teacher I have ever had at any level. The few phone calls he had were because of his level of responsibility with his full time job  they were few and far between. Students took calls if needed also.
2,You girls need better taste in Men. He was always taking calls from work which intrupted class & made it hard to follow. That CD you got he knew nothing about it. There were DVD's in the Library that were easier than he was. I never showed you any short cuts for the work. He was usually Late for Class  up to a half an hour or so. I was notimpressed
5,GREAT teacher! Always makes class laugh and is gret to look at :) . I wish I could take him for more classes.
4.5,good teacher! he is always trying to make the class laugh
5,He makes class fun and is easy to understand
5,For a guy in his forties  he's got great eyes. Thinks he's a comedian but at least he's upbeat and makes class fun while learning.
5,He is an awesome instructor. He explained things well and through in a few jokes here and there to make it interesting. I would definitely consider taking in Algebra class.
5,Santa Clause is a awesome teacher........
4,I hate math and it hates me  but Mr. Seat explains thing that makes it easy to understand. I took him for elem. alge and would of took him again for inter. alge but he was teaching in Leb and I did not want to drive that far.He doesn't require you to do homework it is just practice for you. All of his test is submitted on line= to an A on the test.
2,Act like he didnt care and didnt want to be there.
5,very easy teacher doesnt take a whole lot of effort to pass his class....not a boring teacher would most definately recommend for a teacher
5,GREAT .. GREAT. That's all I can say. I hate math and did good in her class because she goes step by step in everything. She is fun to look at because she is different so she always has your attention. Her last name isn't MaFadden anymore I don't know what it is know.
5,Highly skilled competent instructor and a beautiful personality. Highly recommended.
5,She is a great teacher who makes everything clear. She'll help you when you need it.

5,Dr. Lombrana is the best teacher I have ever had. He actually cares about his students and wants them to not only do well in his class but in their future careers. He does make you work for that grade though.
5,If you need to take Patho then I highly recommend Professor Lombrana. I haven't taken a course in person in a long time and never cared for them  but Lombrana have a way of effectively teaching. He literally holds your hand and walk you through the material. He makes time to be there for you and genuinely cares that you pass and will help you
5,Dr. Lombrana is the best!!!! He really cares about his students and wants them to do well. If you are lazy or don't show up to class  you will not pass this class. You will need to study his PowerPoints a lot.. but he does a great job explaining things to help you understand. I will be taking him for as many Biology classes as I can!
5,I would take every class Dr. Lombrana had to offer!
5,Amazing professor
5,Awesome
5,Amazing teacher  always available to help me out when I had questions  I look forward to having him for my next two sciences classes. AMAZING. A lot of work  but received an A in the end. :)
5,Note: I only had Mr. Lombrana for the lab part  not the instruction part. He is a cool guy  laid back  and is very clear on all his instructions. No tricks with this guy  he tells you exactly what he wants.
5,The use of your notes in very important. Study your notes VERY GOOD  and detailed. And you will pass. A 5star teacher in my book. he will always work with you if anyting comes up.. I'm in CO  BSN program  and i will still refer to his notes.
5,The best teacher I've ever had! :)
5,Very understanding and will always go the extra mile to help any student out. Has a heart of gold
4,Very Helpful and provides very good powerpoint visual aids
5,a little repetition in the class  but that just means the material sticks more! Calm  cool  collected. Great prof!
5,Dr. L is a wonderful teacher  caring  compassionate  overall excellent with his students and their achievements in his class. Thanks Doc.
5,He is a really great professor that always puts his students first.
5,Dr. Lombrana is a wonderful instructor  his attention to detail and student oriented teaching approach is outstanding. I've had a variety of college professors  but he is by far the best instructor I've ever had. He is very dedicated to seeing his students succeed and I hope that someday  I can give to others the knowledge that he has given to me..
4.5,No Comment.
5,love this teacher. he is so awesome and very very very helpful. I know he's reading this right now. I know you are because this is his cp's homepage!! hahahaha..
5,I love Lombrana. He is an excellent teacher and makes difficult subjects easy and interesting. He has lots of charisma and is a pleasure to have as a professor. And he has a really cute smile.
4.5,Lombrana is a very great instructor that cares alot about his students and their success. An asset to the school and our community.
1.5,So boring I could have hung myself in his class. He sounds like the guy for those commercials asking if you have dry red ichy eyes us these eyes drops. He is BORING!!!! If you want to keep your sanitiy DO NOT take this class!!!
1,BORING
4.5,Mr. Lowe is bay far the best prof I had while at VSCC. It always makes him self available and is great even outside the classroom.
1.5,Mr. Lowe is not only a very intellegent engineer and a good teacher  but a very good person as well. He will go out of his way to make sure you understand the material and his office door is always open. I highly recommend him (not that you have a choice  he's the only engineering teacher at vol-state)
5,McMcDonald was a great teacher. He wanted you to succeed and was extremely helpful. I am an adult student and struggle in math and he never made me feel like I couldn't do it. I'd take him for all of my math classes if I could!! I had to drop at the end of the semester due to other issues and will take him again if he is teaching.
5,great professor...only thing that got me through college algebra was having Todd for elementary and intermediate
5,I LOVED him.VERY cool.Willing to stay late and help those who need it and teaches slowly and patiently.Even lets you call him Todd!!(lol)Made us feel like he was a friend tutoring us rather than a prof. math is NOT my subject..but he was totally cool and very helpful..and his tests are pretty easy too!!
5,Todd is a really good teacher.
5,He is a great teacher. Makes learning fun and is willing to stay late to help you get it. One of my favorite teachers so far.
5,He's the BEST teacher I have ever had. Take him and you will not regret. Thanks  Todd.
5,"Mr. McDonald puts the ""fun"" in maFUNmatics! I highly recommend!!!! :D"
4.5,I took Elem.Algrebra twice and this is my second time taking Int.Algr.I wish had knew Mr.McDonald when I took Elem.Al. He is the bomb and explains everything where it makes sense. He also curves test grades everytime. Take him and you won't be sorry. HE'S THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4.5,this is the best professor to take if math is hard for you. he is very helpful  extremely generous when grading  and truly wants you to understand the material. i would definetely recommend this class to anyone who has a little trouble in math!
5,Amazing man!!! Anyone who has been out of school a while should take him. And he is very pleasing on the eyes:)
5,He is not an easy teacher but he is very helpful  considerate  and funny. I learned how to like math bec. of him. He encourages students to ask questions and explains things in simple and clear manner.Students who are scared of math should take him. He is the best teacher ever !!!! :)
5,Mr.McDonald is a wonderful teacher. He is such a pleasure to be around. He has a way of making algebra make sense. He is by far one of my favorite teachers in all my years of school.
5,"""The Todd"" is the man. I am sure that if I had had him as a math teacher earlier in life  I would be a rocket scientist by now."
5,Great teacher! He knew how to push me to reach my potential. He always offered help before and after class for those who wanted it. His tests were easy if you studied for them. I wish he was not limited to just Math! He would be great in other subjects as well. He relates with his students since he has been there before.
5,Todd is the best teacher you could ever want to have if Algebra has always been difficult for you.It doesn't matter if everyone in the class is getting it and you aren't  he'll always take the time to make sure you understand before you leave his class!! He rocks!!!
5,Awesome teacher! He does whatever it takes to help you succeed.
5,Todd makes learning algebra fun and I learned a lot from him. He always takes the time to help anyone who needs it  so they understand how you get from one step to the next.
5,Wonderful Professor!!!!
5,"I totally learned alot from this class.....I have always had a hard time ""getting"" math but not with this teacher."
5,I took Elementary Algebra in NewSkills and thought that was good. Well  Mr. McDonald teaches the class better than the little CDs on the computer in NewSkills. I have the CDs at home and I learn more from him than I do with the CDs. I have learned and retained more from his teachings.
5,she seems really nice so far.. i think i'll like her...

2.5,If you plan on taking this course and then transferring to another school and follow up with French 2010 you will be very  very behind. I learned this the hard way when I went to MTSU.
3,She is kind of scatterbrained and unorganized  but she will go out of her way to help you if you are having problems with the language.
2.5,Very scatterbrained kinda unorganzied but very nice and helpful
4.5,SHE IS VERY HELPFUL AT TIMES. SHE IS ALSO VERY FUNNY BUT SHE CAN ALSO BE DINGY.
3,She doesnt really teach on a beginners level for beginners french. shes a nice lady  but her thoughts are always scattered and confusing. she repeats herself alot so we basically went over the same thing EVERY day. which got frustrating as she was assigning other things but was still explaining some of the first things we went over in class.
2,very scatterbrained  often waits until five minutes of class are left before handing out quiz. will review information that we've already been over twenty times for the benefit of one student.
5,Great teacher!
4.5,Holy crap- what are ya'll thinkin? I LOVE this woman. Her class was so frickin easy and she LOVES class discussions. Homework was minimal and he grades fairly easy. Oh man  if I was still at VSCC  i would take her in a heart-beat. AWESOME TEACHER.
1,She's terrible! English is my best subject. Sh etried to destroy that. She was more concerned about you writing about HER view points than your own.
2,she is so nice but so scattered brained
2,Everyday I left with a migraine. HORRIBLE. Her voice makes me want to cringe. I can't believe I have to take more classes with her for the ECE major.
4.5,Nancy is great! She is one of those professors that you either love her or hate her. You have to be open to constructive criticism and take her advice when she gives it to you. Go to her for resources!!! Not only will she see your trying but you'll get good grades. Nancy knows what she's talking about so take her seriously she can be a tough cookie
4,Nancy is a nice person and really wants you to understand the material. In regards to the comments on her being mean and rude I did witness that but I think it is one of those things where if you nag her and get on her bad side you stay on her bad side. Just do the work be nice  and ask questions and remember she is a person just like us!
4.5,Seriously the best teacher I have ever had. I would totally recommend taking her classes. Very helpful  always willing to go the extra mile to make sure you understand everything. very giving  and wants everyone to do well. LOVE THIS LADY!
1.5,She was horribly rude and mean to everyone in the class. I hated going to her class and often went home feeling like I wanted to cry. Her dealines are all over the place and she is less then helpful when asked a question (that is when she doesnt put you down) She told my whole class that we should drop out because we are going to make bad teachers
4.5,She is a FABULOUS teacher who is EXTREMELY nice. I have two classes with her this semester and have not heard one mean thing from her mouth! She is a very smart woman and I actually learned something in these classes!
1,She is the worst teacher I have ever had. She will embarass you  put you down  and make you afraid to ask questions because of the nasty responses you get. She is rude and nasty  and unhelpful. I dreaded going to her class  and so did the rest of the class. Unfortunately  for educ majors having her as a teacher is unavoidable  so be prepared.
5,Nancy is an intelligent person and an awesome teacher. She knows so much and is very willing to help. I am so much more knowledgeable having worked with her.
5,Class is a lot of work and def. should be more than 2 credits  but what can you do. She was a great teacher  just make sure you are ready to discuss and take the time to do your papers very thoroughly. Easy A  if you are willing to work hard at your placement and take your time on your papers
1,worst teacher i have ever had. if you get her for a placement  you better look out. words cant describe her...
1,shes aweful and has no priblem trying to embarasse you or make you feel stupid
5,She is really full of ideas  she's a wonderful kindergarten teacher. The whole time being in the kindergarten is fun! If you ever had any question about teaching...go to her! She's great!
5,Nancy is awesome! She knows everything about children and will help you.
5,Awesome teacher  very willing to help  but has her favorites

4.5,I LOVED Professor Osaitile. He was very sweet and really cared about his students and explained things a lot if someone still didn't understand. This was by-far my favorite class. He is such a sweetheart and you'll love him. He is really big on participation and gives out a ton of points at the end of the semester that really help your grade!
5,Personally  this class was the easiest. I tell you that he gives points out like skittles. Prior to this class  I did hear that he was very hard. He is not! He is strict tho when it comes to directions. But I passed with an A+. Pretty funny and easy going guy. He wants you to succeed. It does get annoying whn he asks to read frm the book  USE A LOT
4.5,Professor Osaitile is not easy  but he is more than fair! You HAVE to follow all of his instructions! The devil is in the details! If you participate in class  follow the instructions  and show up for every class  you will do well. I learned a lot from his class and most of it was paying attention to what I have been asked to do.
1,"Used to be my best subject but very tough/confusing professor. He means well but honestly the language barrier WAS an issue and his grading was ridiculous. He handed back a paper 3 times to ""fix"" without reading/grading past 1st page  so I never knew what to work on and got bad grade anyways. Talking to him was no help  he acted like I was stupid."
5,Excellent instructor. Is not easy  but makes class fun. Lots of writing. Did not lik group essay  but all else fairly easy. Some reading/bookwork but great class.
4,He is not an easy teacher  and comes off as harsh at first  but he is extremely helpful! He deeply cares about his students and wants them to do well. As long as you follow his instructions for the assignment  you will do well. He is always open for questions. I would definitely recommend taking his class!
4,A GOOD INSTRUCTOR HIGHLY RECOMMENDABLE FOR ENG 1010 CLASS IF YOU WANT TO MAKE AN A HE ALSO DASH OUT POINTS IN ORDER TO HELP YOU HAVE GOOD GRADE HE IS GOOD
4,A very good instructor he is highly recommendable for english courses.
4.5,Not an easy class  but if you do the assignments just as he has instructed you to do  you will do fine. If you have questions about his grading  just ask him about it. He deeply cares about his students  especially those that care about their education. Participate in class to get bonus points  they really add up at the end of the semester!!!
4,Nice guy. Easy A. I suck at writing and hate english and I got an A. Only did 3 papers instead of the normal 4. Gave everyone in class a 100 on a paper just for having it on time. Didn't even grade it. Gives 10 points at the end of the year for perfect attendance. Very Easy.
5,He is so great! He comes off as harsh at first. After a few class days one will notice that he is a fantastic instructor that really cares about his students. Many of his assignments are easy and fun.
4.5,"He is definitely NOT EASY!!! So if you are looking for a ""bird class""  do not take his class. However  if you are interested in learning the fundamentals so that you can write college level papers  I STRONGLY RECOMMEND HIM! He seems harsh at first  but the more you get to know him and joke with him  the better the experience will be for you. :)"
2.5,Strict and doesn't follow his own syllabus rules! Very thick accent and yells at students like we are stupid little children. Overstates obvious things like we couldn't comprehend.
3.5,Mr. Osaitile is an awesome instructor. He makes everything relatable and fun. His grading is kinda strict  but he is fair. He expects you to turn everything in on time but will give extentions is he thinks you deserve them. Overall I would recommend him to anyone.
5,At first  he appears harsh and rigid.But as time goes on you will begin to understand him better. He really does care about students  just take the time to show you care. He's SO funny and just down to earth. He's really big on respect  more so than other teachers. Overall  the course is clear and not too difficult at all. Oh  and follow directions
1,If you want a Nigerian English teacher who has an extremely thick accent and does not know the English language very well -- then sure. He is not fair  helpful or clear. Any paper you turn in is not good enough. Oh  and he likes to yell at the class like they are unruly children. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS!
1,He is so picky about the papers and his grading scale makes no sense. He is always changing something around and he pretty much murders any work you turn into him.
1.5,I would not take this guy. His grading is all over the place  and he judges your work based on his ideals. Take someone else you won't do well in his classes.
3.5,"Gives a rough first impression. To be honest  I hated him after the first class  but as I got to know him he is a great instructor. A little hard to understand  as he is from Nigeria but overall not that big of a deal. As long as you try to write a good paper you won't have any problems with him. He does not like ""flashy"" papers. Keep it simple."
5,great teacher  u want to take this class
5,She has a hunger to teach everyone well. She deeply cares about education and wants to make sure everyone learns the material. She teaches great. She gives plenty of time to complete assignments. She also works with you to help you get a better grade if needed. Manageable workload. Easy Grading. One of my favorite teachers yet!
4,This was one of my toughest professors at VolState. I had her for American Literature so obviously I had to read before every class period. I also had to write 1-2 page(s) journal entries for each reading assignment. Don't do the journals last minute  you will have to compile them into a folder to turn in. You ALWAYS have to participate in class.
3,I loved Mrs. Malden because of her sarcastic sense of humor  but the class for me  was pretty hard. We had four papers going on at once  and it wasn't very organized so I was left confused a lot. She is very strict on her grading so take the time on your papers or you will end up failing. If you miss more than 3 classes your grade goes down a grade
3.5,Overall  she is a pretty good teacher. As long as you read and do the work you'll get an A. I learned a lot in this class. We only had to write one essay  do one seek assignment  and take three quizzes. Do the work and show up and you'll be fine.
5,Ms. Malden is a very good teacher. If you do the reading and other assignments you will get the grade you've earned.
5,I hated english and mrs. malden when i first got to her class  but her hard knock life teaching made me a better student
5,I learned a lot in this class that at the time I did find realinteresting but realized later how useful this information is. If you do your work it isn't hard to get an A
1,She is not a great instructor what so ever.
5,She is a very good english teacher. I had her twice  The grade you work for will be the grade that you earn
5,No Comments
1,She goes off topic a LOT. One time in class  we were discussing about literature  and then all of a sudden we were talking about Cinderella!!
5,She talks a lot  and most of the time after classes you will wonder why you even went. Her class is very easy and laid back and I never got anything less than a B. Attendance is not mandatory and she cancels class a lot of the time.
1,Reynolds does not lecture and give clear lessons about how to write effectively or interpret the literature she assigns. This is a self-study class-- you must learn on your own. Assignments are vague and unclear: you only learn what she wants after she returns your work. Very hard grader
5,I LOVED HER. Im defintley taking her again. Shes incredibly sweet  and has really good advice  and will help you with anything you need. coming into csm from another school was hard so i felt so relieved when she helped answer many of my questions. Fair amount of essays  but topics are fun and relatable! research but she walks you through it!
2,"Very nice and understanding  but the only form of teaching is by talking and rambling for an hour. Says ""obviously"" at the end of every other sentence when nothing is actually obvious. Goes off topic a lot  but does get material in. She is very open to helping you with your work."
1,If you want to waste an hour of your day or you just need a place to sleep i recommend this class because you'll just sit there and listen to her ramble on until you forget the topic of the discussion  she is a nice person and can speak of good topics but at the end of the day you'll wonder why you even went to class that day
3.5,Reynolds is the best. Super sweet  helpful  easy class. Very accommodating to late papers.
1,Was not a good teacher
1,Was not a good experience
4.5,I'm one of her creative writing students. I love Roberta. She's smart  funny  and sweet and understanding. I'm not in love with the class  always. It's not her fault  it's the class. The talent level varies wildly  and I feel like we focus on the poor writers significantly more. I'd like a higher level of talent in the class.
4.5,There are 5 essays you have to do throughout the semester. A few grammar tests. Classes finish early (woohoo!) She helps a lot during the process of writing the essay - just make sure you use her help in editing your drafts and what not. Not a tough grader  but you need to submit all essays. Grading is also very clear
3,I actually would take her again because personally  I've enjoyed writing her papers. I've taken her for ENGL 848 and currently  ENGL 100. Your grade is based on five essays and you can't skip one at all. The topics were easy so writing the papers were a cakewalk. Instructions for essays were straightforward. Basically  just do all of your work.
4,Easiest class i've ever taken. Must i say more?? Just make sure you do all your poetry. And there are only 2 long papers you have to do. Other than that  there's just a poem a week.
4,There are three essays and final is a presentation. Attendance is not mandatory. Professor Reynolds is pretty easy in grading. All readings are in the textbook.
3,She's weird but she's not hard. I can't say that her class was interesting or I learned a lot  but I can say that her class was definitely not difficult. She's really weird but she can sometimes be interesting. I think some people are judging her too hard on here.
2,Reynolds is weird. She gives you relatively easy papers to write  you write them alone  and turn them in on the day they are due. The ONLY time I went to class was for the first two weeks  and thereafter only to turn in my papers or have a grading conference. This teacher is not for anyone who is not self motivated.
2,Dr. Reynolds was a peculiar teacher that did not really lecture much at all after the first few weeks of the semester. Her essays were not too difficult but she did not really help explain how to go on about writing them. It felt like a self study course with class visits just to turn in the assignments. I ended up with a B in the class.
4,"She's a great person and teacher. She might weird you out on the first day... but it's the first day. I ended up liking her a lot. Allows you to manage your working time and she'll recommend what you should have done... obviously there's a due date for the essays. Typically excepts work after deadline... but DON""T PUSH IT!"
5,This is probably the only professor that will answer any question a student has with the correct answer  and most importantly  without the text! If you are a SERIOUS STUDENT and want a teacher that fully understands the subject they are teaching  I highly suggest you take this class.
5,This professor is one of CSM's finest. She works with her students so they understand the material. She goes out of her way to give students feedback about their work. She KNOWS what she is talking about when teaching class  even without the text. I learned a lot from her. I'm a better writer because of her.
2,Judy is kind of crazy. This class is very easy but its painful to sit through. No homework so that's nice but she's kind of all over the place. Not sure if she's actually worked with children before but it's an easy A
1,This class is very easy. A short essay every other week and a few in class group projects. Judy is always 5-10 mins late to class and often cancels class. She is unorganized and her grammar/spelling on the board and in prompts is terrible  but if she doesn't like your wording in your paper  she will mark you an entire letter grade down.
5,Judy is very clear about what she expects. If you do the work  which isn't very hard as long as you pay attention  you will do well. She is very sweet and the classes were decent to sit through. If I were a THAR major  I'd take more classes from her.
4.5,Judy is generally a few minutes late to class  but she always gives an overview of what to expect in class that day. She's helpful if you have questions. The plays and movies watched/read are fun if you involve yourself otherwise you might drift off. The essays are easy if you just sit down and do them  otherwise they pile up quick. Super nice lady
5,Judy is such an amazing lady and all who have commented here don't know what they're talking about. This was my second class with her and I feel as though I have taken so much out of both classes. She really allows you to be creative and everyone's opinion means the world to her. She truly means well & its noticable how much she cares.
2.5,She comes to class late  and lot of cancel classes. Got B's on all her assignments and got an A in the class. Not really helpful outside of class. Attendent is helpful because she changes the assigment all the time
2,Not very enjoyable. Judy is always late. Easy A though.
3.5,The easiest teacher ever! She cancels a lot of classes! Definitely an easy A! Class is a joke! Highly recommend taking her!!
1,"Judy Navas is under-qualified as a professor at SSU. As a ""Fine Arts"" instructor a certain degree of literacy is expected  and Ms. Navas seems to be void of such ability. Constant spelling errors and grammatical mishaps in her essay prompts  mispronunciation of words  and a disappointing level of difficulty has made her class unbearable. AVOID."
4,Talk about the easiest class ever! But not only is it easy  but I found it to be quite interesting. If she assigns a paper the class has a discussion about it so that everyone is on the same page. She is an enjoyable lady. I think this is the easiest A-1 category class there is! Take this class!!!
5,If you want an easy class that meets GE requirements then this is for you  especially if your other classes are hard. She's nice and flexible. Often late  often cancels. Easy to impress her. Final is a fun puppet show. Sometimes tedious. The lateness got old too  but I liked the class overall.
4.5,Judy is very nice but frsutrating professor. She didnt show up for many classes and was late for the ones she did make. Classes are a breeze and an absolute must for upper GE.
3.5,"Judy's class was easy and interesting. Her class consisted of ""showing up and enjoy the movie"" then go home and write a discussion paragraph within your group members online. We only had to write couple papers during the entire semester (just explain what you think of it)No textbooks! Judy deserves some respect from her students!(some ppl were rude"
1.5,I must say that I agree with all of the posts everyone has done. I was a TA for her class and she not only sloughed everything off on us (including the grading)  but she posted the grades we gave her late - wreaking havoc on my financial aid. Really  this is a dangerous situation for serious students or anyone wanting to learn.
1,No Comments
2.5,Always late and scatterbrained. The group projects were fun. When you write papers for her she grades horribly. Told us to write an opinion paper  one page-then commented that I had too much personal opinion and needed to add more fact to make it longer?!? I get straight A's in all upper division Hutchins courses and she gives me C's on papers?!?
2,This class was horrible and needs a new format. I love theatre and acting but I dreaded going to this class. It was a waste of my time and energy.
1,Absolutely AWFUL  She is the most horrible teacher and has a dumbass aid jerod who cannot hear and marked people absent when they weren't. Biggest waste of time she should be FIRED!!!
2,She's gotten better now that she has hearing aides. She's a bit scatterbrained  though. She's nice  and you make alot of puppets  but you might not learn alot. She really likes Woody Allen.
2.5,An easy A  but I can't say I really learned anything about theater I didn't already know...and I knew very little going in. Wrote 4 papers (2 pages double spaced MAXIMUM) and did 2 skits  one of which was on a childrens story. *DON'T BOTHER PAYING FOR THE READING MATERIALS!* Download them or get them from someone else! Again  easy A.
5,He makes everything very clear and very easy I enjoyed his class and I HATE to write
5,Dr. D is the best!! I had him in high school and he was the nicest man ever!
2,He is never wrong. Try to ask him something on a test why it is wrong  he wont admit he made a mistake in grading.Even took it to another teacher and said that it was right. So if you make a mistake always your fault because you didnt learn the material supposedly
2,Ok teacher  but just dont even bother asking why you got points taken off  or to explain what was wrong in a problem. has favorite students and favors them in grading.
3,Really difficult class  but you will learn a lot. Memorizing all the equations is challenging  but hopefully one day it pay off. You work hard on the homework and minitest and he rewards you with a reasonably easy final (if you study hard)
5,No Comments
5,Very interesting class. This tacher knows his stuff. You will learn things in this class that you wouldn't learn anywhere else. Great guy  very helpfull
5,not the easiest class  but hes a great teacher who teaches you a lot
4.5,Great teacher. Very smart. He really knows his stuff  you can learn a lot from him. Watch out for those minitests though. And you have to memorize ALL equations. He is one of the best teachers at LMU
5,AWESOME!
4.5,Soooo. easy. dont know how her grading system work because i got 70 on the midterm(didnt study) but still got an A for the course  but dont let that deter you lol
4,All Wang does in this class is just talk about current events. You don't actually learn anything about intercultural communication  but at least you're semi-informed about what goes on in the world. Class is pretty easy  with a few easy assignments and a midterm and a final.
5,Dr. Wang is an excellent teacher. Very interesting. Bases majority of grade on group and individual projects  and loves anything you say or do. Definitely would reccommend!
5,she is crazy- thats what is cool about her!
4,If you want an A in this class  you just have to do the work. It doesn't even matter if you're the worst public speaker ever  because Wang understands  and she likes to give everyone a good grade. Besides  the quizzes are straight from back tests  and you don't need a book for the class. Above all  she's a riot  and class is actually fun at times!
4,She is seriously a very intelligent woman. She will keep ya entertained for hours with her stories about her trips to Geneva  Paris  Australia  Switzerland...I dont think theres a place this woman hasnt been to. Knows the subject...def recommend!
5,I think with Wang the engine is running  but nobody is behind the wheel..
5,Wang is super!! She's a bit of a looney tune  but that's ok...I got a 15 on the first test but still did well in the class..Go to her office  she'll take care of you
4,Wang is cool and she has a good approtch to in class presentations where some teachers would corner the students into a political discussion Wang allows student to choose any topic and can be creative with it which in my oppinion is the better way to go.

3,"Ahhh... everything is ""wonderful"" for her.. very funny but I have no idea what she's talking about (0_0)"
5,she is the best teacher in the world...... if u want an easy A .... take her please... b/c physio is going to kill u!
5,He was very good.
5,The class material was interesting  and he was always available for help/questions. Extra credit was made available. He's a really nice person and probably one of my favorite professors.
5,Dr. O is the best professor ever!! He keeps you interested at all times  even at 8:30 Saturday morning!! He is what teaching is all about. He's an inspiration...I hope I'm half as good as he is when I'm a teacher! I hope he teaches more classes in the future!!
5,BEST PROF. EVER! You will learn a lot. It is an inspirational class. He is one of those teachers who is difficult to find these days. If you want a great experience and well developed phylosophy when teaching  take his class! In my professional life I would always remember Dr. Orihuela.
5,Very inspirational professor...Made the class interesting and fun...FIU should definitely keep him...I never met ANYONE who truly loves and enjoys educating people. The class is easy but you must put in work. The teaches are fun and you learn a lot from them.. I will miss Prof. O and his class sooo much! BEST PROF. EVER!!
5,Dr.O is the greatest Professor ever. I am honestly depressed that the semester is over. You will learn so much from him and there is never a dull moment in class. Lots of fun and always keeps your attention. I recommend him for any class you can take him with. Sweetest man too!
4.5,One of the most knowledgeable and caring professors ever!
5,He is an easygoing professor. Very clear in what he requires  which is not a lot. He keeps the class entertained and awake. I strongly recomend him.
5,Amazing professor! One of the few professors that has left an everylasting impression. I learned so much in his class. He makes everything interesting! However  the class does require a lot of assignments but you'll do them and not care. He is just that awesome. You have labs where you need to prepare teaches (intimidating) but it's a wonderful exp
5,He is the best professor I ever had! I wish he taught more classes. He is funny nice and very inspiring. go to class and you'll do good on tests I promise! I learned a LOT in this class. the labs are not hard depends on your instructor  they are very helpful. I never missed one of his classes  if you want to learn  take him! Prof.O is the best!!
5,Very inspiring professor. Class is entertaining. Attendance is not mandatory  but GO TO CLASS OR YOU WILL FAIL. Midterm is hard (Bloom's). Other assignments are easy. Teaches are nerve-wracking at first  but easy once you get the hang of it. Group A has less time to prepare Teach 1  but everyone has the same amount of time to prepare the others.
5,Prof. O is amazing! He is such an inspiring teacher and knows what he is teaching. The course requires time consuming assignments (the teaches) but he makes it very doable. He's awesome! If you need to take this course  DEFINITELY with him.
5,"Prof. O is such an inspirational teacher!! I love being in his class. I've learned more from him than any of my other teachers EVER!!!! I really enjoyed his enthusiasm and charisma. He clearly is passionate about what he does. I hope FIU ""wises"" up and hires him full time. I think he would be an exceptional grad. school professor! BRAVO  PROF. O!!!"
5,excellent professor!!! you must attend class if not you will not pass!!!! makes class intresting. the teaches are a lot easier than you think. there are only 4 and the groups are small. you are allowed to help each other out. overall a very helpful class.
5,Awesome teacher  but you must show up to class! Thats where you get prepared for your teaches. He is very passionate and knows what works  trust it! Midterm was difficult on blooms taxonomy  but over all easy. The teaches were easy as well  not mention kinda fun!
5,AWESOME teacher! He is great! I totally recomend him and I wish he taught more courses. The teaches are a bit nervewrecking  depending on your lab instructor
4.5,ATTENDANCE IS VITAL!!!He tells you what he wants and how he wants it.Midterm a bit hard final is essay format.You are required to teach in a group setting.The teaches can be difficult depending on your lab instructor  some can be VERY picky. Make sure your teach group interacts your grade depends on them helping you and asking the right questions.
4,Very good professor. Knows his subject very well. Willing to help you 100%. It is very hard NOT to pass this class. The teaches are a bit nerve-wrecking  but it gets better. Very inspirational guy as well.
4.5,He provides you with great  practical information for teaching strategies. He is fun  articulate and knowledgeable. The classes require quite a bit of work and the mid-term and final are tough.
2.5,I guess he is a good teacher. Definately better than the majority of ed profs at FIU  but he is extremely cocky and most of the lectures are spent listening to him explain how he is the greatest teacher ever. He is extremly opinionated and doesnt allow for students to have their own opinion pertaining to ed. Also the labs are unfair be in group B!!
5,Super nice professor. You will learn alot from him. The labs are a bit difficult if you are in group A because you only have one week to prepare each lab and group B has 2 but he knows his stuff and is entertaining. Really cares about giving you useful information.
5,ABOVE ALL A GREAT PERSON. HE IS A GREAT TEACHER. HIS CLASS IS EDUCATIONAL AND ENTERTAINING. GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR!!!! I WISH HE TAUGHT OTHER CLASSES!!!! MY BEST FIU PROFESSOR TO DATE.
5,she was awesome when she taught here...she had the most interesting classes
4.5,No Comments
1,"can't stand her--tells you her ultra liberal ideas are fact and if you try to argue and discuss like a normal classroom atmosphere  she gets extremely upset and tells u u are wrong and whoever told u that is wrong. today in class she said only white people can be **** and only males be ****. she also said that ""if bush were black he would hav"
1,terrible.
2,I found Darwin to be extremely unqualified for teaching this class. Though she knows her english  we very seldomly actually did english. I feel that if i am mandated to take a class like i was with this english class  then i should be learning english and not just discussing her life as a teen.
4.5,Shes fun and interesting-- and her sons adorable
4,I really liked the class. First time I did well in a science class. The tests were tough. The oral presentations were easy.
5,Course integrates many science areas. Clear book  can handle the tests because each covers only 5 chapters. Like the prof  graded fairly  provided extra credit  knew our names  and emphasized concepts over memorization.
5,Good science course for non-science majors. Just follow the syllabus.
5,He's into it and I learned a lot.
5,Old tests are available for study. View them! Gives extra credit too. On line quizzes and group labs. Not much math.
4.5,"Can""t wait till we find another earth_ interesting class"
5,Just finished Astrobiology for non-majors. Many of us thought it was our favorite class of the semester. Interesting topics and labs.
5,Demanding but provides many opportunities to learn and earn a decent grade. Many group labs.
5,The universe is amazing.
1,I took this class my senior year and I was a physics major. I hated it  so boring  I didnt pay attention or do any of the work. A waste.
5,No Comments
5,Thought his class was great. Just do the reading and you'll be fine. Study guides are most of what will be on tests. Good class  studied well and got an A-
3.5,he's hard. but not impossible. when he tells you to study the past exams that are on reserve ... do yourself a favor and study the past exams. they will help you. i promise.
4,he's a nice guy  very interesting class  tough but do-able
3,Very nice man.. but prides himself on making his class soo imposible  The tests suck  the labs suck and if your not a science major DONT waste your time with these classes. He is pissed off b/c people take his class as an easy Sci credit and he slaps them for that by making work impossible
1,Taking this class for non science majors is a joke. I failed the first test though I got A's on all the labs. He gives a lot of extra credit but it's not enough when the tests are impossible and worth most of your grade. It was a mistake to take this class as a GSC requirement.Don't take this class!
1,very nice & intelligent man  but the labs are impossible (including things not covered in class) & you're not allowed to work with anyone on them. the material is ridiculous  & he's the only one who understands his clarifications. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.
1,My  goodness! I just want to sleep through his class. If I slepy with my book I'd probably learn more then by going to his class. The labs make no sense. So please  do me a favor  don't take Astronomy with him. I'm begging you.
1,horrible  horrible. Worst teacher I have ever had in my life. He just repeats things from the book  and then gives extremely confusing labs that he doens't explain how to do  nor does he ever clarify the correct way to do them.You can't learn anything.
3.5,he's not horrible... the course itself is pretty interesting. study. its hard to pull an A off in this class  but if you're good at science/math you'll be fine. he's really nice otherwise.
4.5,She's scatterbrained at times but she knows what she is doing. You'll come out of her classes knowing a lot more than when you came in. You just have to be willing to do the work and there is a lot of it. If you have a good attitude about the class you'll get an A.
2,I think the class would have been better if she remembered that it was an Introduction to Costuming. For someone who had never sewed before it was a lot of work even if I tried my hardest. It got to the point where she was moving so fast I would never have been able to catch up  especially since she is pretty unhelpful at times.
4.5,most fun classes ever..Julie is an awesome teacher and anyone who thinks otherwise needs their head checked...
5,julie is great  anyone who disagrees is just jealous  or very insecure about themselves. she shops for costuems for shows  you morons  not herself. i've had her for other classes too  and she's been nothing but professional and fun!
1.5,No Comments
3.5,She is very nice. She tries real hard to do well to her students. She is still learning with us.
2,She went shopping during class one time and expected us to stay the whole time to sew costumes!
1.5,She was incredibly unhelpful. Does not care about the difficulty or amount of effort put into your final project. She plays her phone messages from her boyfriend really loud so the students will hear them and think she's cool. Very tacky.
3.5,Class as entertaining as the disscusions of the topic  which at times were trite. But she does try to apply the class to modern day and mix up topics  history  politics  culture. Pop quizes on the readings  but they aren't tough. Eases up around finals  watching movies in spanish. I would recomend  but also depends on how interested your classmate
4,She's pretty though. I think she expects a lot  but you will learn in her class. Her tests are pretty easy all you have to do is pay attention to class discussions and you'll do well on the tests.
2,No Comments
3.5,She isn't impossible but she does expect a lot. I was surprised that the class was taught in Spanglish..at the 400 level. Don't worry too much about the readings  she will go over all of them in class. If you don't have an answer to her question  no big deal because she prefers her interpretation. Lord of the Rings and Har
5,Hard readings in OLD Spanish. She has been helpful when I've talked to her.
4.5,The readings are difficult  but we were allowed to discuss and work things out. Our class seem to work together well. I think if you read  you enjoy the discussions.
1,Far and away the worst teacher I have ever had!
4.5,Yes she is a tough teacher and she does intimidate you. But if you really want to learn spanish and literature this is the class to take. Its a lot of reading. She is very knowledgeable. You might hate it but i think the pain was worth it. You will only get how much as you put into the class.
3,She is horrible  worst Spanish teacher ever!! I am a native speaker and she made me hate taking spanish. She has favorites too which is stupid  and because I spoke spanish well she automatically assumed we would be buddies. I don't think so!! Just put this weird lady in her place and you will have no problems. Just take Phil.
1,She was somewhat of a nice person  but she was not quite helpful in the classroom. She does show favoritism  especially to those in her classes from the summer programs.
5,I loved this class!
5,I liked the class and the readings.
1,Horrible!! Poor lecture skills. Poor interpersonal skills. Finds favorites (Which i was one of) and takes care of those select few. Everyone else is left on their own and is frequently harrassed in class. Never enroll for her courses
2.5,She is extremely nice. She just needs to work on a louder speaking voice when she gives her prayers.
1,No Comments
1,She is the biggest trick ever! Don't ever ever ever take her class!
5,really hard class  you need to come prepared for each class to succeed. Make sure to pay attention during the lectures otherwise you'll be lost. READ the textbook
1,Worst class I have ever taken at UNC. This is a pre req for med schools and dental schools and most people in there are taking this class for that reason. This class is extremely tough and they do not try to help or explain things well at all. If you can take it somewhere else do it! I made the mistake of taking it here and now have to repeat it.
2.5,He is a nice person and I have found him to be more helpful in one-on-one situations. The lectures are not particularly helpful  since you are expected to do the bulk of your learning in studio.
1,Terrible lecturer. Disorganized. The Physics department is terrible  and he is apart of this mess. You'll never know what you're doing  and their terrible explanations won't help at all. Good luck! Also  they have no official textbook so good luck finding what you need to know!
2.5,Professor Tsui was so convoluted in his explanations for problems  it left me even more confused. He goes above and beyond in his lectures  so be prepared. His exams are the hardest I have ever taken here  even after taking orgo and biochemistry. Be prepared.
3,reading the textbook is a must. he's a nice guy but not the greatest teacher. tests can be hard but he curves pretty generously. write down all the examples and demonstrations in your notes
3,I found this class to be very difficult. The tests were extremely hard and I struggled most of the time. Frank is a cool guy and knows his stuff. Class was entertaining sometimes and deathly boring the other times. The TA was absolutely worthless  I dont think she engaged anyone in the class at any point.
3,The lectures are fairly boring to someone who isn't interested in physics. Attendance is required because of the iClickers as a part of your grade. Tests are challenging but he curves generously. HW is assigned often and there are online quizzes. English is not his strength  but it's fine. The class is not overly difficult and is manageable.
2.5,Demonstrations in class work 45% of the time. His English is his second language  so sometimes it's hard to understand him. His tests are ALL short answer (*not sure about the Final though.) Many opportunities for grades
4,Very easy to understand. He had some great in-class demonstrations too. The only things that bugged me were the clickers for attendance. Make sure you get a friend to pick your up for class if you're going to skip.
3,A lot harder than i thought it would be!
4,Great teacher if you are interested in Physics. He is fun and makes sure to include the class in discussions/lectures. His teaching style might make it hard for a student who is not interested in Physics. Taking AP Physics makes this extremely easy.
2.5,Does not explain his lectures very well in class  instead preferring to discuss concepts over doing actual example problems. Reading the textbook will be a must as you will probably not learn the material any other way. His tests are also poorly worded and described. Would be better if he could actually explain his lecture material.
5,#NAME?
2,Spent hours studying. Not clear on homework assignments. Essays graded harshly. Should of dropped the class.
1,Unreasonable professor who's too meticulous. If you're looking to take a class where you're graded according to your performance  this isn't the class for you. She has a set grading criteria on paper but fails to follow it herself at times. I highly recommend not taking her class.
1,Shes honestly the worst teacher Ive ever had. She grades poorly  shes rude  if you dont do something its basically the end of the world for her. Im currently in the class and shes nothing but rude and disrespectful to each student. Just sat outside the classroom with a few students and we all agreed shes the worst teacher here
1,Unclear on assignments. Unprofessional and rude. Grading criteria on papers is extremely subjective. She has no problem handing it extremely low grades for fully completed assignments. Taking 101 again because of her.
2,Pretty rude and a unreasonable prof. Stay quiet study when she says to study  do the homework and you should be fine. Her grading criteria is not to bad though  gives what you give to her. Still would not recommend her though!
1.5,She was very rude and I would not recommend her. I had to switch out of her class.
2,"Horrible  horrible ""professor""! She hardly every smiles and when she does it's very rare because 90% of the time she is yelling at her students like they""re children! Be prepared to feel like an idiot if you don't have the answer she is looking for! She is by far the rudest lady on the planet! I can honestly say I hate her!"
1,stay away from her   she give us alot of homework i was spend the weekends doing the online homework  it takes me more than 3 hours   so be careful ...
1,She's rude and treat the students like if they were in high school. If you talk while she's talking she makes you stand up until she's done. Hate this teacher with passion. She has a different personality every day. Don't take this teacher she's an old bi**h. She doesn't care if you're trying everything needs to be perfect. Don't recommend her.
1,i hate her
5,she is awesome
2.5,No personality! Go to class  do your work  keep quiet and you will be fine!.. When she says study  STUDY! A lot of people didn't like her  but those were the people that she was mean to because they did not do their work!!
4,she knows exactly what she wants. it was an easy class. take notes on how to write. do your homework ad she usually gives extra points.
2,she was the worst teacher i've ever had. she would have a different personality every day. and she rarely or should i say hardly ever passes anyone! so if you take her GOOD LUCK and have fun
4.5,great teach
1,No Comments
1,****!!!!!!
4,Jekyll and Hyde. One moment she is smiling  and the next she is anal. But is fair. DO your work  and keep quiet and you'll be fine.
4,she has a split personality...friends say shes mean at all her students...i think differently she is nice to a lot of them...good teacher if u want strict and to learn a lot
5,Great professor she help me a lot   my other English classes were A  THANK YOU
5,No Comments
4,Ms. Serra is not the easiest teacher I have ever had  but she is obviously motivated to help every student pass the class and learn to be a more confident speaker. The other raters said she is very forgiving with absences  but I do know people who were dropped for being absent too much. After all  it's a speech class and you have to be there.
4,Ms. Serra is awesome. She wants you to be able to communicate well and to pass her class. Sometimes her lectures lack clarity but she makes up for that with plain silliness. Easy A if you just show up to clase  though she is VERY forgiving if you miss (just give her a good reason why)
5,took another prof. before and dropped because was too critical and was horrified of public speaking. Ms. Serra makes you feel very comfortable. She has a very unique style which makes class fun...Her number one goal is to make sure you pass. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!
5,Great teacher.Out going person. you will never be bord in her class.
5,Ms. Serra is a very odd instructor... but in a good way! She is very silly and fun and she helps you in any way possible to succeed in the class. She will do anything it takes to get you to come to class  she even thows pizza parties. This class is very enjoyable and an easy A.
5,ms. serra is an awesome teacher. very unusual  but extremely fun and helpful. a must have class
4.5,Ms. Serra's way of teaching breaks down a lot of barriers within the first class meeting. After that it becomes easy to speak in front of the rest of the class.
5,As an older student returning to college  she was so supporting and respectful. Since English is not my first language  I had anxiety to take any oral communication class  But in her class she valued my background  effort and my accent.She tought me how to be an effective speaker in the society.
4.5,She creates an atmosphere of awareness and motivation.
4.5,"I dropped this class two times before because I was so scared to take Speech. Ms Serra made it clear that STUDENTS AND RELATIONSHIPS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN BOOKS AND PAPERS! We still gave speeches and wrote papers  but I learned how to ""mean what I say & say what I mean."" Ms. Serra rocks!"
4.5,Ms. Serra teaches the very opposite of other teachers which helps a lot when learning because you actually want to get involved and participate to get that A! Thanks For everything!!!

5,Hi Katz n Kittens! Mz. Serra is the BEST teacher period! If other professors followed her exemplary way of teaching more students would LOVE learning. But  alas  Mz. Serra is a cow! No really! She is a cow and oh so totally hot at the same time!! Mz. Serra however is NOT an easy A. She is a FUN A !
5,Ms. Serra is wonderful  brilliant and HOT!!! But she's such a COW. I've never met anyone who can be a COW and a beautiful person at the same time  but she does and she's good at it. Thank you  Ms. Serra. I enjoyed your class.
5,Great class! She helped me overcome my fear of public speaking. And she's soooo hot!
5,Best Speech teacher there could probably be if you are dreading the course in any way. She's really helpful and she honestly cares about everyone. The class should be simple for anyone comfortable with public speaking  and it'll be helpful to those who are not:)
5,Mz Serra is great! She cares about all her students and makes giving speeches fun! I'm no longer nervous to give speeches  because I know that she cares about me and only wants me to do well. Show up to class give your speeches  and you'll get an A!!!
5,She's just great! Wants EVERYONE to succeed. Very helpful  energetic  and fun. Helps everyone to become comfortable with standing in front of a room of people and speaking. Before enrolling  I dreaded this class  but from the first day  I got a sense
1,You'll face inadequate tests that will give you a LOT of stress. No Canvas  so you'll be guessing what is your grade until the end of the quarter. I will never recommend his classes to my friends!!!
5,Bob Baugher is an amazing teacher. He goes through and explains his lecture. I really enjoy taking his class. Its definitely a good class to take if someone close to you has died.
5,By far the best professor in my four years here at Highline.
5,Dr. Bob is one of the best professors out there. His lectures are very interesting and you can always relate to them. He always tells stories that are fun to listen to. As long as you are doing your studying  you'll do great on quizzes and exams.
5,My favorite professor at Highline! He cares more about the students actually getting and understanding the information. He gives feedback on all returned papers  and he always has them graded within two days. Really cares about his students.
5,He is sooooo cool  but this class is not easy on exams. Definitely a good professor with passion but be ready for the reading...
5,I took Dr. Bob's class because all of his amazing reviews- and he is now easily my favorite professor I've ever had. He is so knowledgable and this was one of those classes you will never forget. He has the best stories and his lectures are amazing. Tests are a little long (few short answer questions) but as long as you take notes  you'll be fine!
5,I enjoyed Dr. Bob a lot since he made his lectures engaging. He also sets up the classroom for you to interact w/other peers. If you need to take this course for credit  I definitely recommend him. Take good notes-it'll be all the material you need on exams. Use notecards  go thru the book  and remember key definitions. He gives bonus!!
5,Best class I've taken at Highline. I got to know everybody b/c he made us memorize everyone's name to do class discussions. Gives MANY extra cred  so be sure to do them all. Might seem like 1pt doesn't matter but trust me  it adds up. Returns tests next day b/c he believes you should get feedback asap. Read book & study. Take Dr. Bob! No regrets!
5,one of the best professors i had at highline! so good at what he does  one of those classes you will remember for a lifetime.
5,Such a great professor. Definitely one of the rare gems at highline. If you're taking psychology make sure to take it with Dr. Bob. Very inspirational! Loved this class!
5,Great professor. Cares about his students. As long as you do your work and extra credit you'll pass.
5,dr bob is the best proffessor i have ever met you have to take his class to believe he touched my heart  he does everything possible for you to pass the class he has extra credit and he is flexible. you will love his class
5,He is really nice professor that I have ever seen. He helps me a lot!!!! I wanna take his class again:)
5,Dr. Bob is an amazing instructor! His lectures are beyond amazing and so enjoyable. I took both is Psych classes my first year at Highline and I absolutely do not regret anything. He's very organized too! Make sure to do those readings and study those before an exam! There are no secrets! Just read  memorize and study! DO THE 1 PT BONUSES!!!
5,One of those professors that you'll remember for the rest of your life. His lectures are engaging  funny and packed with information that sticks with you. He assigns a lot of reading and memorization because he wants the students to realize how much they're capable of. Every member of my class got to be friends with eachother.
3.5,I've never dropped a class  never not had a 4.0. I walk into his class first few days are good  a lot of handouts given  but i loved his lectures  he made the topic fun and enjoyable to learn. BUT YOU HAVE TO STUDY YOUR BUTT OFF. TESTS ARE REALLY HARD. MANY OF THEM. THEY ARE LONG. If you want a challenge  have him as a teacher. Don't recommend
4.5,Dr. Bob is the best teacher I have ever had. He is respectable  friendly  funny  and brilliant. On the first day he gives you all of the essential information needed to pass the class  it can feel overwhelming at first but it's incredibly helpful. He fulfills his promise of teaching you all there is to know about Human Relations. Highly recommend!
5,Dr. Bob is such a great teacher. Yes  his lectures are long  and his reading assignments are very (very  very  very  ...) long. But  in the end  it is all so worth it. Make sure you know how to take good and efficient notes. Don't be that one student who looks lost during lectures. I would take his class over and over again if I could. Just do it!
5,He's more of a stand and talk kind of guy. His handwriting can get a bit messy to read
3.5,She is a pretty good teacher but the harder you work on an essay the lower your score. I half-assed my last two essays and got A's while working hard on my first one and got a B. She an easy grader for the most part and this is her last semester.
2,This class is very boaring. Lots of reading. Four essays plus a group project. Seems like she looked down on our generation. Not very helpfull. We have to read the stories and peer edit our own papers. SO just sits their or talkes about who knows what.
5,Carla is a straight up G. She loves the material  and loves seeing students dive in and excel. With that being said  she's a babe and a half.
3,lovessss it
4.5,Requires a lot of reading. Nice old lady  who respects others comments. I highly recommend if you enjoy reading  but has limited office hours. She will do her best in class to help you with your essays. Kinda crazy lady though!
3.5,She is easy  but grades harder than you think. She is old and rather slow  but makes the class fun. I enjoyed her class but expected a better grade than what I got.
5,"She is very enthusiastic and has a love for teaching that reminds us of why college offers just a lot more than grade school. She reinforces the importance of using the words ""I"" and ""feel"" which help re-establish the individuality of a writer. She was a thrill to have  and her advice  as well as wisdom serve as an added bonus on her resume."
4.5,Great professor. Fun  funny and loves the subject. Always interesting and very helpful. Never a dull moment and I took the class in the morning!
5,Carla is a crazy little lady. She definitely keeps the class entertained. There's no tests and no final. only three essays  and they're all relatively easy. if ur looking for a fun and easy English class u definitely want Carla to be ur teacher.
5,"She is the nicest woman ever  low homework...she is very understanding..i got a kidney infection in the middle of semester and was out for 2 weeks..i tried to come back and she said ""you dont look so well go home and rest"" NICEST WOMAN EVER! no tests  midterms  and finals! sooo nice! just engage in dicsussion you will make her day!"
5,By far my favorite teacher. She is extremely intelligent and intellectual. This class is the only class I actually looked forward to going to. Her class has a lot of depth to it  and she makes it very easy to achieve a high grade. Great woman.
4,No Comments
4.5,Great Professor!!!! Very helpful...pretty easy class..definitley would recommend in....shes very helpful outside of class..very opinionate but in a good way
5,I love Carla! She emphasizes discussion in class
3.5,This teacher will talk your ear off during every class  some of it relevant to the subject. She is pretty opinionated  although she claims otherwise  so choose your words carefully. Overall  she's a great teacher and your assignments aren't hard. It was an enjoyable class.
5,She is a great professor. She had my back when the campus dean tried to expel me. She is there 100% for the well being of all students in the classroom and out.
5,No Comments
5,I loved her class. She is very interesting. She cares more about your ideas than the topic of English. She is simply amazing!
5,Very sweet lady  fun class.
4,Sweet  elderly lady that is willing to go out of her way to help her students and is always open to suggestions. Allows for re-writes and attendance is not required. (Don't be alarmed when she hits her head on the wall!)
3,Professor Ho's lectures are convoluted and w/o structure. She gives nearly no opportunities for student involvement. That said  she is truly passionate about her work and her students and it shows in the lengthy and helpful feedback she gives on the four essays she assigns. The readings are amazing  it's just too bad we don't get to discuss them.
5,Wendy Ho is definitely a professor who cares about her students. She is accessible  approachable  hilarious  passionate and truly a one of a kind professor. She takes the time to get to know her students and is encouraging. Yes  her assigned readings and essays are challenging  but she teaches so much and is a great resource. I loved this class.
1,omg worst prof I've ever had. She literally talks in riddles and there is so much reading and theyre difficult. She pins you into going to lecture cause participation is 30% and 3 other papers plus final. I literally can never follow her at all! AVOID!!! Pretty much my entire class dreaded her and the material.
1,Oh my god this has probably been my worst experience ever as a student. She rambled on and on n on during lectures
2,You have a LOT of readings every week. The midterms  final  and papers (2) are based on these readings! She repeats what is important in lecture so you can't miss it! Participation in discussion is a must for points. GO TO THE TA for help on the 2 papers! It makes a huge difference. I went from a C+ (1st paper) to B+ (2nd) after meeting w/ the TA.
2,She is passionate  but style of instruction and evaluation is not reasonable. No PPT  substantial readings. MCQ can be ridiculously tricky  and the ambiguous wording remind me of SAT. In discussion  you have to talk to get the points. The evaluation of paper totally depends on your TA  which could be subjective. Remember you have other GE options!
2,Personally  I didn't enjoy this class. While TAs were very helpful and kind  Professor Ho tended to go on angry rants during lecture. She's very passionate  but she would digress from the readings and run out of time educating us on the history. Tests were relatively easy if you did the readings...4 or 5 20 pages readings per week that is.
5,ASA 1 is the best class I've taken so far. Prof. Ho is very passionate in her teaching  and I suggest you participate  ask questions  answer questions  sit near the front to be engaged in the course as she can go on tangents. This course will fulfill a lot of GE  but you got to work for it! A lot of reading and 2 Papers  Discussion worth a lot.
1,Prof Ho is one of the worst lecturers I've ever had in my three years at UC Davis. Do not take her class. ASA 1 with her was extraordinarily difficult  and I've been taking upper division classes in ethnic studies for two years. She cannot explain things simply
4.5,Just do all of the required readings and attend lecture
4.5,Super inspirational! Loved this class  though she tends to ramble on about the same things for the first half hour of every class. Midterm and final are both multiple choice (45 &50 questions) and are easy IF you do the reading. DO THE READING (there's a lot!!!)  though the way the questions are structured isn't too hard to guess. 2 5-7 page papers
3.5,Tough class with a lot of material. Although much of it is dry  you will learn a lot  probably more than you should in a single 10 week class. Tests are straightforward and follow the reading she assigns.(which is a ton)
5,Great teacher to take. Talks about the importance of effort and learning with passion. Love to take another class with her.
4.5,She is amazing to listen to. My favorite class ever. Very discussion based. No tests. Three short papers (possibly creative project substitute)  a group project  and two short write ups of your choice. Do your best to read  and talk with her if things come up. She can be flexible with assignments. She's not out to fail you  but you have to try hard
2,Lectures are confusing and boring  I gave up on going at all. A looot of readings too  however tests are multiple choice and super easy if you keep up with the readings and do her handouts. There are 2 5-page papers  overall an OK class  pretty easy to get a B  if you put a little bit more effort in you can definitely get an A.
1,So hard to follow her lectures. Every time I actually went to class I ended up not being able to take any notes because she speaks SO unclearly. Tests are pretty easy though
5,She's such a wonderful lady. The textbook she used was very relevant and great for the class. She was very relatable and understanding.
2,"TONS of readings! And she often goes off on random rants about life. This quarter her favorite lines are ""Don't be Spongebobs! Or Walking Dead!"" Sometimes going to lecture is totally useless. But then there are other times when she is focused and actually explains/clarifies the readings."
1,Oh No  forget this lady. She made my life hell. Never take any class with her  it's a warning. Her lectures are boring as hell  she only gives her opinion and doesn't give actual facts. Her exams are stupid pointless  I honestly don't know how she became a Professor  Just don't take her especially all the reading she makes you do is a bit crazy.
1,Her lectures are absolutely pointless the only real reason Ito go is for the handouts she would give. She claims cares for critical thinking yet the midterm and final are multiple choice. The amount or reading is absolutely ridiculous! The amount of reading is absolutely ridiculous! Trust me and please save your self don't take this class!
5,Dr. Andy is super passionate about his classes and UCD. Not for everyone  but I personally enjoyed his class. His essay prompts and grading criteria weren't ambiguous or unreasonable. Participation and attendance count- he makes that clear from day one. If you're content to not show or show up with a disengaged attitude I'd find a different class.
3,Half of class was spent with him humble bragging about how marvelous himself and his achievements are and the other half was spent with him explaining his unclear prompts in the most obscure way possible. He's a tough grader with high expectations so to office hours and get feedback on drafts before turning in your final paper and you should do ok.
4,I feel like Dr. Andy is a love him or hate him kind of professor. Because he talks about things he likes poetry  film  music and gives lots of factoids in class  it could mean amazing or bust depending on what type of student you are. I personally liked him because I learned a lot during class and office hours. He nurtures creativity. A family man.
1.5,He makes a great deal about being in class in order to pass  yet all he talks about in class is his poetry or his books or his columns on newspapers! He spends 85% of the class time bragging about the same things on a daily basis. How he got selected  how he was awarded! The bragging never ends! It amuses me how he manages to sneak it in everyday!
4,Nice guy. Joined his Freshman Seminar on accident. 3 poems a week  and if you go to his favorite poetry club  he'll buy you sweet potato fries.
3.5,Why does Dr. Andy not have a chili pepper? THE BEARD!
5,Dr. Andy makes this class very interesting  I would take it for sure! My favorite professor that I have had at Davis.
4.5,Dr. Andy Jones is a great Professor! He always had extra office hours in Downtown Davis. He is really helpful. Although he is a tough grader  its only because he wants you to be a better write. You will learn a lot. The readings were light  not too much. Also  he's really funny. He always made the class laugh. It's a class I never wanted to miss.
3,Tries to engage the class  and have them participate which is nice. Really seems to have enthusiasm and want students to learn and better themselves as writers. Can be really intimidating at times and overpowering though  also grades rather harshly so don't be fooled into thinking this class is easy. HARD WORK + PERFECT ATTENDANCE = AVERAGE GRADE.
5,I loved this class. The class topics provoked a lot of thought and discussion. I learned a lot about my writing and how I can combine writing with my photography and other multimedia work I do in my other TCS classes. Dr. Andy assigned interesting readings. Some of the writing assignments were hard. Definitely a lot of work. Definitely worth it.
4,Dr. Andy is the best! The class was very eye opening  and Dr. Andy allowed us a lot of flexibility as far as creativity is concerned! The reader is amazing  I will pass it onto my kids. The assignments may seem unclear at points  but really  you realize Dr. Andy just wants you to materialize the assignment into anything you like. Best teacher
3.5,Good teacher but he requires a lot of busy work and assignments are unclear at times.
5,Great teacher! Professor Andy Jones made the six-week quarter fly by. I liked his PowerPoint quizzes  and his crazy allusions. The class is a lot of work  but he grades fair. I really appreciated Andy's wide-eyed humor - he connects almost everything we read to other assigned works  or to pop culture. I would take another class with him in a minute
5,I learned a lot from Dr. Andy about how to think and how to write. He's a funny guy who makes a reaaally long class (three hours in the summer) fly by. He makes you get to know your classmates  which is also cool. The group assignment was tough  mostly because of scheduling challenges  but I learned the most from that paper. And from office hours.
5,Dr. Andy's class really inspired me to learn and to think creatively about my writing. And he also brings a ton of energy to class discussions. I can see why ASUCD gave him the Professor of the Year award! Congrats Andy!
5,awesome guy
4.5,Very enthusiastic teacher  very fun and exciting class... had some very unique and original projects for the class.
4.5,Andy's one freaking awesome English teacher! 191 is designed to allow you to use and experiment with different kinds of media and Andy asks you to do all of these... butt crazy things that you don't really understand why you're doing it  but at least it was fun and unpredictable! Workload is kinda heavy  but if you keep up with it  you'll do well.
3,andy jones is an extremely nice  kind  teacher. always willing to help you out. However this class TCS191 needed a lot of work. What are we learning? What is going on? What is the purpose? I have never been so lost  yet not? in a class before... ... what?
4.5,Great Teacher  very enthusiastic about class. Can be unclear about assignment.
5,started with lif  ended with death (The Class)
4,He was a little unusually but really engaging. Class was always interesting and he held my attention. I also learned a great deal and even sort of look at life a little differently now. It is a shame he no longer teaches.
5,I was hoping that Mr. Kmetzo was still teaching at NVCC  as he was one of the most inspiring teachers that I've ever had and I wanted to comment. Kmetzo still stands out in my memory as one of the best teachers  even though I took his classes in '89! Funny and interesting person - Highly recommended
5,Tom is the greatest of all time. The number 1 teacher I've ever had. A bit out of the norm but  ask him what the norm is and he'll tell you it's all about the chairness! Truthfully the most inspiring man of my life -Dean (where are you)
3.5,Took his freshman seminar class and found it quite interesting. This was a pass fail class so it wasn't hard but he was helpful...he did talk a lot about his life but it was interesting to me.
2,Worst prof EVER! Very unorganized  very boring  and talks too much about his damn life. Talks about other BS that dsnt have to do w/the class. Loses ppl's papers and tells us we're at fault! What a butthole! 3 papers only. 1st paper can be redone since ppl always get a low grade. If you're retired (as he is)  DON'T COME BACK TO TEACH!!!
1,There are no words to describe the torture his class inflicted on me. He is disorganized  unclear  boring and shares too much personal information. The were not that bad but his lectures were horrible! Avoid him!
1,i regret enrolling in this course. *not happy*
1,ok so this class is by far the worst class in sociology i have taken  as a matter of fact  the worst ever lectures are so boring and his teaching is so unorganized the reader and his handouts were complicated to find nothing was in order and it was simply just not enjoyable i hope he hasnt been teaching it this way all this time. finally it's over!
2.5,very confusing. i regret enrolling in this class. his soc 128 class is way more tolerable than soc 129.
3,It is hard to understand what the class subject is really about his lec are very boring most of the time he has a lot of info that he wants to share but often are just stories tha tdont relate. no tests  3 commentaries and 3 short quizes attendance counts and will help your grade
4.5,Despite what others may say Jorgensen is the the coolest and smartest prof in soc.his deal:he has been in davis for 30 years his class isn't normal  it's creative and he is constantly challenging ideas and making you think.What people can't handle is that he really cares about his material  and about his students  but he presents it differently.

1,WORST.PROFESSOR. EVER!!! He was so boring  he didn't listen to students  and if anyone talked in class  he put them down. If you went to his office hours  he's always late and he won't respect your point of view - he will argue with you and make you think you're wrong.
1,Boring lectures. off topic all the time. inconsistent grading. cancelled office hours and appointments with students. Not a good class at all. Worst professor in the soc department.
4,Jorgensen...Interesting character. The class is very unique and very unlike any other class on campus. Interactivity is upon your interest. If you raise critical questions  discussions can make you ponder even after the class. We went out to a movie and dinner as a class. If you are on waitlist  don't count on it.
3,If you can handle a boring lecturer then take one of the easiest SOC classes. The way to get an A is all in showing up and participating. The essays are a bunch one one pagers  super easy  and partly graded by TA's who quickly become your friends. If you want a easy class on a rocken topic  who cares if he rambels  your TA will clarify everything.
1,i still have no idea what the class is about. he goes off topic a lot and he's not clear on assignments. he's really boring too! worst professor in the soc department.
1,The hardest part about this class was sitting through the lectures. Just do the reading and the take home papers will be cake. Make lots of references to your reader and the handouts he gives you in class. Definitely skip as many lectures as your conscience will allow. So much potential wasted!
5,Jorgensen is the best professor in the department bar none. Lectures  handouts and video documentaries are all quite educational. Jorgensen is truly an inspiration.
5,easy class for a seminar  not that much reading. also  Jorgensen is so funny.
1,The man is insultive and unable to conceed any point. He is an awful lecturer and his theories are ridiculous. What a waste of money.
1,Complete JERK! I do NOT suggest taking this class by any means. He is unclear  boring  and incredibly pompous. He thinks that just because he is old and graduated from Harvard he is intelligent. HE IS NOT!
5,The exams are not cupcakes  yet Dr. Donaghy gives many opportunities and resources to preform adequately. She is lecture heavy  and fails to project her quiet voice very well  but I love her class. Sit near the front  take decent notes  and read through the chapter vocab and you'll make an A or B
4,I took her minority and stratification. She is a very sweet lady. It is hard to understand her because she talk so low. You must read your chapters to pass her test. It is not an easy A if that's what you looking for. Overall  I enjoyed her class especially minority groups.
4,If you've taken her before for a 3000 level class and are expecting her social theory class to be just as easy  think again. The tests are KILLER. Reading is not optional if you want to pass. The tests are not multiple choice  they're matching and short answer.
4,I'm taking her for Minority Groups. If you read over the material at least some before the test  you'll make an A or B. Discussion Boards are basically completion grades. Be prepared to stay the full class time--she has a lot to say.
1.5,Only thing good about this class is the bonus points but the questions are so hard the bonus points are worthless. Also in this class there are graduate students  which set the curve way to high and everyone else struggles.
5,Love this Professor!!! Her voice is soft and monotone but she is wonderful.
3,Overall great teacher  however she has a very low voice so it is hard to hear her. If you read the chapters and show up to the bonus videos you will get a Good grade. Attendance is also not required after the third week of school.
5,Dr Donaghy is a great professor. If you actually read the book and listen to the lecture it is an easy A.
3,She is sweet but SO HARD to pay attention to. Tests are difficult even with a study guide. I studied hard for every one but never made an A.She passes around a sign in sheet every day. LOTS of opportunities for bonus points. It could be better but it could be worse.
4.5,She's very sweet. Class is terribly boring but she does pass around a sign in sheet almost every day. Tests aren't hard but they aren't easy  and you do get a study guide. She is very smart and passionate about her subject.
4.5,shes very knowledgeable about her chosen subjects. attendance isnt necessary. tests are easy. the classes are dry and boring  but incredibly informative. she talks  you listen....get a good grade. easy as that.
5,Nice. Boring. Informative. Go to class. Do your homework. You will be fine.
5,If everyone approached life as she does we would have a better world  and Minority Group should be a mandatory class for every major  maybe then we would learn tolerance for others and thier cultures and not be so closed minded  we are in college where we should all have open minds to new things  how else can you grow as a person...
4.5,very smart and nice.
4,Easy professor  will be boring though. does not take role after first week. goes over every question in lecture. or you can just read the book and skip. is very nice and super helpful with any questions. one of asu's best professors.
3.5,This is for Minority Groups. She is very boring  but a nice lady. She does drop the lowest test grade. You don't have to go to class much. She posts everything on Blackboard. Easy class  with alot of extra bonus assignments. Dr. Donaghy is very nice and will help you if you need it.
3,OMG!!!!Boring..but a good teacher is willing to work with you during hard times....attendance is not a deal with her at all..and little speackers that asu has she gives you extra points for going....
2.5,Gender class. Did not make the course very interesting  at all. Does not take attendance. Tests are extremely easy! Nice teacher even though a little hard to hear and listen to after a while. Grades exams quickly and posts blackboard promptly. no surprises  essays  pop quizzes  or 'projects'. Tests do contain a few 'attendance' required questions.
4,Social theory is not an easy course. The tests are hard. She is difficult to pay attention to. Read the book and do the group presentation. You really do have to read the book. She says so and she's serious.
4,Very easy all you have to do is get the notes off of black bored and study that....You dont really even have to go to class all you have to do is look on blackbored everything is on there!!!
4,Absolutely the most caring and knowledgeable professor I have ever had! Boy! Does he know how to teach!
5,Devastatingly handsome. But mostly a great professor  who cares a lot about his students. Make sure to speak up during critique!
4.5,Hale is a wonderful professor  grading is fair. He might come off as mean  but he is not at all. He makes class enjoyable with his stories.
5,I took sculpture 1  2 and 3-d design with this man  and if i was not an art ed major i'd be a scultpure major. I learned so much and had a great time. Hale is like obi wan.
5,Excellent Professor A+++
4,Mr. Hale is awesome! He loves to interact with his students  and loves to have fun. Watch out for the first day or two you are in there with him because he comes off as a bit mean. He's not mean at all  just let him get warmed up to the class first. Take him  you will not regret it!
5,Mr. Hale is a great teacher with a good sense of humor. He may come off a little rough at first  but he's great. He expects you to put in the effort and will grade accordingly. Put in the effort and you will do good. I would definitely take him again  in fact I am.
5,Carroll is a very effective professor. He's a bit on the grouchy side  but incredibly intelligent and skilled. I have the highest degree of respect for his teaching ability and talent. If you are cronically late  miss class  or don't put in enough time outside class you won't get any sympathy from him. He's tough  but fair.
5,He expects you to try your best and work your hardest. He will even come in outside of class just to help you. If you need help he doesnt mind you calling him at home. He is extremely caring and understanding if you have outside problems that effect your work. He does come off as extremely intemidating  but dont let that fool you. He is wonderful.
5,This class was so much fun. Mr. Hale comes off as an a$$ hole at first but he is such a wonderful teacher. He is a very talented sculptor and knows how to pass his skills on other people. The class is a challenge but only because after he gets a feel for the class he expects everything he knoes he can get and more from you. :)
4.5,fun
5,He was a great teacher and made things very clear for both classes. It sucks that he is gone. His grading was very fair and helped out students alot
5,Tyler Spalding is the best aerospace teacher you can get. He is a purist  so while you may have more work to do  you understand the material to a greater extent and he grades quite liberally.
5,Tyler was great! He explained everything and gave plenty of bonus points. Just be careful on his tests. They aren't hard  but they can be tricky.
5,He is the best professor I've taken in engineering. Statics was a cake walk. Just do you homework and write the homework problems on your sheet for the test and your halfway home. Girls think he's hot.
3,Sure  hes hot  but also fast paced. If you dont get it the first time youre screwed. He doesnt understand that everyone isnt as brilliant as him.
5,All the girls want him :)

2,A nice man  but old and stuck in his ways. He talks soooo slowly that you can barely pay attention and he reads from movie review essays he wrote 10 years ago. A nice man  but makes film boring. (And I'm a film student)
5,Great elective! If you want to learn how to properly deconstruct a film then Bell's your man. Not only does he know his stuff  but he is an engaging and insightful lecturer  and totally engaged with the subject matter. Highly recommended.
3,It's a good elective class. It's not difficult and he's an interesting character. I wouldn't recommend this class to people who are wanting an intellectual  thought-provoking class (you watch movies and talk about them)  but it was decent and easy. Everyone has to give their opinion  so be prepared to talk in class.
3,Allen knows his stuff inside and out  however he's well aware of this  and as such values his OWN opinion. That aside  the class is a breeze and only consists of daily journals  participation  and an exam. If you have ever watched a movie in your life  you could probably do WELL in this class.
2.5,Alan is a really nice guy... I only took it because I needed a 300 level elective and I could get it done in 3 weeks. So if you are looking for an elective take this class  if you have any interest in movies at all... PS. I've never seen anyone break so much chalk in my life! haha

2,just tell him what he wants to hear - he is not interested in your opinion. He teaches same films over and over: China Town  Reel 7  some film on cinematography  Sweet Hereafter and Eyes Wide Shut. He will toot his own horn a lot  since he EDITED the script for Sweet Hereafter. Fair marker  didnt get a lot out of his classes.
4,very kind and experienced. interested in class discussion.
5,Incredibly caring  knowledgable  fair. Unfairly labelled by students who don't listen. His lectures are fascinating.
2,Good for an elective. Didn't get a lot from his classes  and his lack of clarity/guidance left me in the dark at times. VERY odd at times  just say what he wants you to hear. I think he's too old to care too much anymore what others think..?
3,Allen Bell is a very nice man with a command for his subject. He is a brilliant writer and understands the film industry very well  which reflects on his teachings. He picks engaging movies and is fair with his marking.
2.5,Well  he's not lining the bottom of the barrel  as some film profs are--(cough)Hendricks. However  he's tempermental and terribly unclear about what he wants. No effort is really required  so I'd recommend his class to 4:20- types.
4,this was a good class  and refreshing to be in a class with someone who is actually involved in the industry and has opinions. got me interested in film/techniques/art. one of the more interesting classes i took in my degree. i still actually think about it.
2,He still very bitter about Atom Egoyan.
4,How anyone could possibly not adore Alan(sp?) Bell is beyond me. He is smart  open  engaging  charming and quirky--not to mention a phenomenal writer. Layout and marking is fair  films are interesting and diverse. Thank you Alan!
1,Bell is smart and he can be witty  but he's a very bad teacher. His lectures are entertaining because he's such a nut-ball. He'll start yelling for no reasons about a stupid detail from a film. Unclear and vague. Avoid.
1.5,No Comments
2.5,I do not doubt that he is a talented writer  but he seems to be at a loss for what is expected in an academic setting. His course was really just film appreciation with no academic rigour. Instructions to the class could be vague and contradictory.
5,He's a great professor
5,Good class. Will learn more here than in most classes but if you hate speaking in class it might not be for you. But the class is defiantly not boring
5,I can't say enough about Dr. Mulrooney. I was doing poorly in his class due to some personal issues that kept me out of class. I sat down with him in his office after class to talk about it and see what I could do and I have to say that he's hands down the most understanding professor I've had. He let me retake the exam I missed. Incredible man.
5,GREAT professor  he's the reason why I switched my major to BMS. I wouldn't call him easy but he makes the class interesting so you will want to pay attention. If you can  definitely take him!
5,He is such great teacher  very strong science background  very helpfull. He is extremely clear in explain the material. I had him for low level class  but I wish to had for a higher one  but he is the best. He is the king of sciences
5,TAKE HIM!!! You won't regret it!! He really cares about his students. He wants people to do well. He's chair of the department for a reason!
4.5,Secret is going to his study sessions. Great teacher  really funny  holds attentions  learned a lot.
5,"Simply a wonderful professor. Made the class entertaining and fun by using ""ping-pong balls"" It was a journal based class  so as long as you read the papers (and read them not just glanced) you'd do fine. Take any class you can with him!"
4.5,He will tell you what's on the test  but you need to know the answers in painful detail. Don't underestimate this class because everyone told you he's easy.
5,Dr.mulrooney is one of the best teachers I can honestly say I've ever had. He is funny and extremely knowledgable and helpful!
4,Funny guy  which always helps in keeping the attention of the students  especially in lecture. Fairly easy grader  but tough subject overall. If you do your job (as a student) he'll go above and beyond his job  as a teacher  to ensure that you comprehend this tricky subject. Recommended.
5,Awesome professor! Take him if you can - he's great
4.5,You will have him if you are a Bio/BMS major and you'll wish he taught every course. He's the man. Really cares about the students.
4,He is a great professor. He really wants everyone to do well. He keeps you informed about what he expects of you and is really laid back. Is truly a good professor and a good guy.
4,really fun teacher! Takes things a lot more seriously than you'd guess  but it's only because he cares.
5,Awesome guy  funny  fun class  never used the textbook and it was expensive  3 exams
4.5,cool guy. 5 exams... helpful  wants everyone to do well unlike some other teachers.. tells the exam questions before hand.
5,very nice  easy going....nice class... is he married?
5,BEST BMS TEACHER! Tries to have fun with the class  and still gets the material across. He's GREAT! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! I learned a lot from this class.
5,Good guy  easy class. Gives you questions that are on the tests  so if you fail you're just lazy. Learned alot too. Highly recommended
4,Wonderful professor who clearly cares about each and every one of his students. Whenever I needed help with anything he was there to help me. He is sort of goofy but  it makes the class more enjoyable and the time fly by. I suggest that you take as many classes as possible with him. He will help you through.
4,Dr. Kowalka is a great professor. You will learn a lot about teaching  especially if you are planning on teaching social studies.
2,Most of the time the assignments were unclear and everyone was confused. Assignments had due dates but you could turn in whatever you want whenever you wanted to. Did not seem to have to much structure. He is a very nice and funny guy though.
4,Super funny!
2,He will never know your name. Nor will he actually talk about the content he is supposed to be teaching. We spent over a week presenting book reports to the class. He didn't even seem to be knowledgeable about the material he was teaching. You waste so much time in this class. Take it with Knickerbocker... you will walk away a lot smarter...
5,Great prof  great class. Very meaningful experience. I got a lot of useful info from that class  and I still use a lot of it in the classroom.
4.5,He is a very nice guy...I think I can live with him for the rest of the semester..
5,He was my IUL prof freshman year and I don't think I could have asked for a better one! He let our class out 2 or 3 weeks early and only made us write one (one page) paper...which was NOTHING compared to some profs.
4,VERY GOOD. Good class topics. Good first hand stories. A little unclear on assignments  which he plans to change. GREAT CLASS....GREAT TEACHER
5,i want to be just like kowalka!! he is a great guy and very understanding! although you don't do much in his class...the stories that he tells teach you everything you need to know and expect about teaching!!! THE BEST PROFESSOR EVER!!!:)
1.5,Has many many stories. Good prof but hard to follow his directions and will change them next class
5,Great prof! His assignments were easy  yet meaningful. A great beginning to my Education degree! He is easy to talk to  understanding  loves to give out candy  and makes class enjoyable! Great job Kowalka!
5,wow. this guy is great! first class with him  love the class  love the prof. learning a ton without a lot of buys work. best class ive ever had.
5,Kowalka is a wonderful teacher and makes the class fun! I really enjoyed his class
5,Overall  great class! If you have a chance take the classes he teaches  you will learn something for sure.
5,i want to be just like this guy... the best teacher i have ever had...
5,This was an awesome teacher... we didn't do many assignments but I learned a lot from this guy. I plan on taking all his classes

5,Kowalka is an amazing professor...great guy...fun class!
2,He is one of the worst professors  wait  the worst professor that I have ever had. He makes the class way too hard for people who have no clue about Geology coming in. He is somewhat clear in class  but makes the tests very very hard. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS.
2,The man is not helpful in the least. The class is boring and I had as much fun as I would have watching paint dry on the wall.
3,Thies class is way too hard for a 101 class. There is a lot of information to learn and the tests are killer. Rodriguez is much harder than the other 101 professors. I would not suggest taking him unless you really enjoy geology.

5,He is a good teacher very interesting and his lectures are not boring. He is quite funny.
5,Mr. O'Connell really knows his stuff he expects a lot but he is worth it  he's also like 45 years old but looks 25 he's mad hot!!!!
1,She went through whole lectures too fast because her concentrating group was who already studied in high school or worked in Accounting field. I prepared for the first class with reading the first chapter  but it was totally useless.. There were quite a lot of students(8-9) who already know everything and the professor taught them  not us.
5,One of the best prof at Seneca. Shes so nice and easy marker
4,I feel that she really knows what she is talking about  and therefore manages to explain the subjects very well. She is helpful and makes sure that everybody understands the topic  yet one does not feel stressed or pushed.
5,She is amazing professor! Her explanation is so clear and so easy for understanding so you can forget about math problems that you had before :) Moreover she has warm heart and she is very kind professor
4,She's a good professor  just very boring. You always seem to get sleepy and just want to sleep all throughout her classes.
4.5,Listen to lectures. Do the homework. Read the book. She gives good feedback and will clarify any questions asked.
4,Overall pretty good prof. Her lectures can be pretty dull  but you have to remember it is accounting. Pay attention to her lectures and do the homework. She is a generous marker  so on tests make sure you write whatever you can as she gives part marks (she even hinted at this during a test).
5,For me  she is introverted professor but she is very warm hearted. So far  I really like to go in her class (because I study  she explains well and the works are always done on time). Her teaching skill is professional. She knows what students need to pass this course. Participate in class  ask to clear sth u dont know and kill the quizes and exam
5,One of the nicest teachers I have had  she uses ppt in class and makes everything very clear  class is a bit boring but come on it is accounting. she is always willing to help and spend time with students have questions  very patient. If you could  I would definitely suggest to take her class.
5,"I like this professor. She is clear in the class and willing to help students who do not understand. ACC220 itself is a hard course. You need to pay attention. If you show up every time and ask questions  you will get an ""A""."
5,Amazing professor that she explain very well and spend whole class time that mean she don't want to waste any minute.
2,I'll never take her class never...!!!
3.5,Her classes can kinda drag on but she's nice and very helpful if you don't understand something. *IF* you do the homework the class is easy and honestly attendance will not be 100% necessary. She takes 2-3 classes for each chapter which isn't necessary tbh. But I would take her again.
4,Overall she is a good teacher who covers everything that are on the final exams  a lot of the need to go to class is covered by the WileyPlus test and practice although as always it is advised that you do go as she will lecture using good examples and explanations.
4,she is a nice professor! she tries to explain everything for us even though its just same questions :)
5,She is a very good teacher! I recommend! For my subject we used the Financial calculator which makes everything easier! She's very good on teaching you how to use the calculator.
1.5,She gets confused while teaching. I wish i dropped the class.
5,She was by far one of my fav professors in first semester. Very helpful. If you do the homework and pay attention in class you will get an A. She's the best.
5,She is a really nice person  and very responsible. Though her classes are a little boring  she tries her best to explain the book as clear as she can. She's actually a easy marker  but I didn't get the mark I expected  don't know why.
5,she is the best  if you want to learn math go with her  she is like a tutor  goes with the book  she is responsible  she make the test exactly from the book  not the very difficult one but some times very easy one 
1,This is the worst teacher ever. I know his whole life story because all he does is talk about himself and his family. If your Sitting through his class you might as well shoot your self in the foot because that would be more fun then his lectures.
1,I never ever had a prof like him.he is not a fair marker. he will give marks who will listen his own (unuseful)story?????????
1,Nobody can't understand and has interests what he saying. In class  Always He talks all and leave. I don't know why he is doing this job in Seneca.
1,Please drop the class bcz I have no words.
1.5,he is nice  but only the problem is he does not teach  and everybody is bored in class.
2,This guy is the most boring teacher. Use BLACKBOARD there is a reason it used at seneca. If you can't teach and damn your class is so boring then atleast put up powerpoints so we can learn on our own. Always talking about his life so hard to learn from this guy choose another teacher now before its too late.
1,Just reades from the power point and then talks about himself. He's only told us about how successful he has been at every top job he's hold in his life about 10 millions times.
1,Don't ever believe any of his stories. There are all lies. He is the laziest professor ever. Never taking his class again.
1,the worst professor i never ever had.
1,the worst professor i never ever had. he will always talking about his own business. you can't get a good results
3.5,Good prof.  but I must say that he gets boring after telling u the same stories about his business  family  etc. SO  Ken stop wondering why people stop coming to your EIGHT O'CLOCK classes!!! All that aside  good guy  choose him and you'll have it very easy. (1midterm  1 pro  and 1 final)
4.5,He is a very good teacher and fair marker. Just do your cases (home works). You will not have more then two cases for all semester. Do not skip his classes  he does not like it.Also  try to participate in class. This subject is stupid  but the teacher is OK
2,can not learn a lot from his class  no efficient  no quiz  you never know your homework is right or not. but pass might not difficult. high grade is not easy.
1,Dont take this dude all he shows is powerpoint very boring  very unfair marker because only ppl he like get good mark.
2,THIS GUY CANT TEACH. ALL HE DOES IS READ FROM POWERPOINT AND TALK BS ABOUT ALL THESE HIGH POSITION JOBS HE HAD MAKING MILLIONS OF $ IN SALES.
5,little homework no tests just mid-term and final
1,getting good results is impossible unless you attend all classes
1.5,i can't say  he is a good prof. because he gives dood results( A or A+) to his fevorite students only.
2,good teacher. but i can't say he is a good marker
3.5,good teacher. you can easily pass your course with good grade
5,I learned a lot just from talking with her  she's very inspirational! She is one of my fave teachers and I recommend her for computer classes. She was super caring and would answer any questions you had. I passed this class with an A  just do the work and you will pass no doubt. I loved her though  she's super sweet!
5,Mrs. Herbert is amazing! If you show up to class  pay attention  and do the work  you will at least pass  if not get a great grade. She's enjoyable and relational. Fantastic teacher!
5,I really enjoyed this class. I took the online version as long as you do the work and really try you can get an A. There is a lot of homework but it is pretty easy you just have to follow the book. One word of advise buy the book from the school. You need a code for this class and if you buy outside the school you still have to pay for it.
5,She teaches straight from the book but she will go over it in class before you attempt it just in case the book was not clear enough. the actual class and material were easy and she simplified it even more. Great Teacher.
5,Professor Herbert is by far my favorite professor I have ever had (online or in a classroom). She was extremely helpful and truly cared that her students understood the materials. She also made it to where success was easy IF you put in the work. I appreciated her teaching style very much and would definitely recommend her as a professor.
5,Easiest class I had last spring semester! Mrs. Herbert is a very inspiring and amazing instructor! She helped me so much and inspired me to keep following my dreams! As long as you listen  show up for class every time  do the work and ask questions  than it's an easy A. I received an A+ in this class  I would take her again in a heartbeat!
4,"She was a good instructor but really she didn't instruct anything. Everything was based off of your textbook and a ""lab website."" I had some issues arrive and she wasn't willing to work with me outside of one instance. The only reason I wouldn't take another one of her classes is because its not really my thing. I didn't take much away from it."
5,The class is about Excel Word PowerP &Access. She goes through all  if you know much about functions and querying in these program you will do just fine. She teaches you the basics and then goes very in depth so pay attention. Everything comes from the book so don't hesitate to get ahead of the game. Grading is amazing hundreds of points & likeable
5,I took this class for an 8 week semester. I'm pretty good with Microsoft Office in general  so this class was pretty easy. Plus  Herbert is very nice and everything is very clear. I even emailed her and asked if she would open a couple tests up early so I wouldn't have to take it finals week  and she totally understood and opened them up!
3,Cindy  she is okay I guess  she expects a lot of work for a bs computer class. You have at least 4 to 5 assignments due each week and then when you do them and you follow the directions as best as you can she takes off points without explaining why so you can better yourself. I mean do the assignments and you'll be fine.
5,This class is really easy. You do an in class assignment and then you do the exact same thing in an application. I reccomend this class to everyone. I missed literally 7 points in the whole entire class and the class has like 2970 points. Plus you learn some great things about excel  word  PowerPoint  and access that will help you in live.
4.5,If you ask her for help she's very helpful.
5,This is a great teacher! Thorough  helpful  very punctual. She always got back to me to help  even on the due dates  which were on Sundays! She made videos about my work personally to help me really understand. Love her  and wish I could take the nest class with her. Do the work and you will get good grades. Book absolutely necessary.
5,Cindy Herbert is a wonderful instructor. She's very concise and clear about the curriculum. If you don't show up  and stay the entire class  you aren't rewarded with attendance. Fair warning. I would definitely take her again.
5,"Pleasant prof encourages good work with positive feedback. Questions answered promptly. If you have difficulty  she'll make you a video to show you ""how to."" Competent  clear instruction. Only way to ruin your A is to mismanage your time. Start early in week so you aren't rushed. Training and assignments require closely following text directions."
4.5,Easiest college class Ive ever taken. She gives a lot of small easy assignments. A lot of points in this class which helps if you decide to not do one or two. Easy class  and her being very attractive makes it easy pay attention!
5,A great  light-hearted teacher. Class was very casual. She has great patience and is very willing to help. Wants you to succeed. Easy A
5,I highly recommend Professor Herbert. She goes above and beyond what is expected of an instructor. She allowed me to use a Mac version of Microsoft Office. It was more work for her  but she was very kind. Great instructor and great class!
5,I would recommend her. Easy class and she is very helpful. I learned a lot in this class. She offers practice quizzes and extra credit and should be an easy class to pass. It requires a SAM 2010 program disc that is $50 besides the books  also.
5,I took this class online over the summer.Have not received my grade but I am sure it will be an A.There is a lot of work but Cindy is super helpful if you are stuck on a project.She will call you if you need her to and she responds very promptly to questions.Happy I took this class online in the summer.Hard work  easy A if you do the work.
5,Mark Bryan is an unstoppable scholarly force. Because he actually works as a professional playwright  and actively learns from his students' research  he's becoming smarter at almost the speed of time. It's impossible to be smarter than Mark Bryan in the same way that it's impossible to be older than the universe.
4.5,Great Professor! Very interesting. Does lecture a lot but in an interesting way that keeps the class involved.
5,Ethusiastic  laidback  hilarious  but sure as hell knows what he's doing. Great man  great class!
4.5,So sexy it's hard to learn  but you might pick up a thing or two as he is so full of information.
5,My favorite professor at Denison! There's no one better than Mark. That man knows what he's talking about...and as a young alum  he's got some crazy Denison stories!
5,My favorite professor at Denison! There's no one better than Mark. That man knows what he's talking about...and as a young alum  he's got some crazy Denison stories!
5,great stuff. the essay tests are graded a little hard  the end research project is important. Mark is a cool guy with an animated interesting teaching style. (hard to find one like that) Great theatre teacher.
5,I still get ****s thinking about how hot he is.
5,An excellent person  who is down-to-earth and really knows his stuff. Not to mention he doesn't get all profoessory on you. He's a cool man  and an intelligent one.
4.5,No Comments
4,one of the best denison has to offer. and cute!
4.5,An awesome prof who knows his stuff. I highly recommend him.
2,Mixed feelings. Excellent at teaching the material  learned tons  but tests are very specific and a total time crunch. Will to some extent be penalized if you do not think along the exact lines that he wants you to. I recommend if you want to learn  but not if you are concerned about your grade.
4,You have about 10 homeworks per semester. The tests are based on the concepts covered in the homeworks. Don't be afraid to go to his office hours  he will try to help you without giving you the answer directly. His class is challenging but you will learn something.
3,He is pretty funny but can be hard to understand due to his accent (he's Costa Rican). I think the biggest problem I had was that we would learn the material and have homework  then start learning the next topic  then have the test on the previous topic a week or two into the second one. It's more of the course's fault than his
4,Dr. Fonseca has an interesting teaching style. Maybe it's the fact that this course is 4 courses in 1  but it was very quick and sometimes hard to keep up with. Despite that  Dan the man is a very effective teacher. All the grades you receive are essential  but it's not hard to make an A. None of the tests are cumulative  not even the final
4,Danny Fon is a great teacher. If you go see him in office hours  he will give you the answers to the homework. Final is not cumulative. I would recommend taking him.
4,Fonseca is a fun teacher  but his 349 class can go either way. It is very easy to slack off in that class as there is little HW and attendance is optional (posts lectures online). He is from Costa Rica  so he has an accent. If you go to class and stay on top of the material  you should be fine. Slack off  and you will regret it.
4.5,I had Dr. Fonseca for an honors seminar  but he was very helpful and available to the students. He is very quick to email back and was very generous when grading our powerpoint presentations. He may be different as a regular professor  but I was very satisfied with him as an honors seminar instructor.
4.5,Extremely helpful and an actual fun class. A really nice professor and made you want to learn.
4.5,Great Teacher. He will help you outside of class. Take him if you can.
5,One of the best teacher I have ever had!!
3.5,I don't know if he just hated me  but he destroyed my homework grade and hit a huge dent into my GPA. He docks HUGE points for simple mistakes  even if you arrive to the correct answer  so watch yourself.
4.5,He is very clear and distinct about what he expects from you. His reviews are very similar to the tests. His tests are 3-4 questions and he counts off a lot for little mistakes. But the tests are easy if you go to class and the in class reviews.

5,Excellent  best professor ever!! He is the greatest!!
4.5,This guy's passion for Shakespeare only furthered my own. He's completely fascinated by his subject and teaches with a passion. Totally nice guy  tries to do some hands-on stuff which usually turns out funny :) HIGHLY recommended!!!
4.5,Professor Babula is darling. Just because he is such an adorable little man  don't be fooled. He knows his Shakespeare and you will too after you take his course. Very sharp  funny  seems a little shy  fair grader  makes Shakespeare come alive. I can't imagine anyone not liking him or his class.
4.5,Prof. Babula is a great teacher. I truly enjoyed Intro to Shakespeare. He made the work interesting and did Shakespeare's works justice by showing the plays. Very approachable and knows his stuff. I would definitely take a class by him again.
4,Very interested in everything that he teaches. He is open minded to student ideas and is very fair about grading. There are some in-class essays  but if you read and show up to class they're an easy A. Reading is a MUST  and there is a good amount of it  so if reading isn't your thing  this class isn't for you. Overall  a really cool prof!
3.5,Enjoyed this class  got clear understanding of the context of Shakespeare's plays to history and culture of the time  and how it is used to relate to present day. Recommend the class  film adaptation fun to watch and compare. He is a fair teacher and clear on what is expected from his class.
3.5,He definitely knows his Shakespeare and he'll definitely make it interesting  even for the uninterested. A few essays  nothing too crazy. You watch a lot of the movie versions  which is good by my book. Recommended!
4.5,Has a great deal of knowledge about Shakespeare. Fair grader. One of the best teachers at SSU.
5,Good class.
5,This was a very good class with an even better teacher. He is very respectful of everyone and gets across a lot of information in a short amount of time. Great class!!
5,Professor Babula was very good at getting across a large ammount of information in a short period of time. I would recommend this class for any beginning Shakespeare students.
1,this dude freakin sucks..doesnt respect different view points  shows movies instead of teaching  uses offensive material with no regard for the feelings of the students
5,No Comments
4,I enjoyed getting an easy A from Balbula and watching all the Shakespeare films  but I regret having left the class with about just as much knowledge on the bard as when I entered.
5,"Well done Dean! I still think you must have implanted a ""Shakespeare bug"" in me. I learned a lot and I am sure more will be revealed as time goes on. Perhaps best  the difficult midterm and final essays are perfect practice for next month's CBEST exam."
5,He is one of the best English teachers I have ever had. I never thought that I would get Shakespeare  but he made it possible.
5,No Comments
5,Very helpful outside of class  especially to the person who is intimidated by Shakespeare. Interesting perspectives on film productions  and clear in his expectations. Tests are extremely reasonable.
4,i really cannot believe that he has any bad reviews. the people who are giving hiM bad reviews are the lazy  partying  ones who hate all professors. he goes out of his way for his students and is a wonderful human being. i highly recommend him and suggest that college students learn that they are here to LEARN!
1,I can't believe this jerk one an award for teaching. He is horrible! Overly MACHO and CONSERVATIVE! Made me want to change my major! AVOID!
1,I thought that this professor was horrible. I dreaded going to the class everyday and when he told me that he was not sure how I had made it through college this far... I wanted to tell him to kiss my ass. I hated his teaching style and consider him one of the worst teachers I have ever taken.
5,I really enjoyed Dr. Sweet's class. He made the material interesting and fun! I learned a lot and would definitely take another class from him.
4,He may get high reviews for me  because I did think he was easy  but he really got on my nerves. He is a know it all  and treats every story  poem  novel  and play as if it were a mystery to be solved. Also  if you don't share his opinion you are wrong. Class would be a lot better if he would shut up and let the students discuss the work. JERK!
3.5,English is not my thing. I worked harder on this class than any other and only got a B. You must keep up with readings!
4.5,GREAT TEACHER...TEACHING STYLE WAS INTERESTING ALTHOUGH HIS TEST AND HOMEWORK WAS DEMANDING!!!
4.5,No Comments
5,One of the best professors on campus.
5,His tests are kinda hard  but you learn a lot.
5,One of the best professors at EKU and by far the best English Professor I have ever had. So passionate and enthusiastic about English. Will do anything to help you pass the course. His goal is to have everyone of his students pass his course. That really says alot about the kind of teacher he is. Excellent person and teacher.
4.5,I loved Dr. Blythe! After taking 211 with him i just had to take 212 because i loved him so much. Very nice guy.
5,So much energy  best professor that I have met while at EKU.
4.5,Hal Blythe is awesome. I hate English with a passion  but he made it so easy. I took him for ENG 211 and waited a year before I took 212. I refused to take Engish under anyone but him! He is so helpful and sort of interesting. He tries so hard to help you get through the class. Very nice & caring man.
5,AWESOME proffessor. So much passion about what he's teaching. I'll never forget that class.
5,Not your typical grumpy old english teacher...Very helpful and fair  very good personality  and highly approachable. If you study hard and go to class  a good grade is definitely in reach.
5,Dr. Blythe is a great professor  and I personally view him as one of my mentors as well. If you ever get the chance  do yourself a favor and take a class that he teaches.
5,Man  this teacher is what all teachers should be!!! If you have a class that he teaches  you should soooooo take him! He's wonderful!
5,No Comments
5,Great professor! Very fair with grades  very clear on what to study for tests  gives great notes  and is very charismatic. Very approachable  and seems to sincerely care about students. Only complaint is that you can't wear hats in class  which sucks when you're running late for an 8 a.m. but then again small price to pay.
5,Kinda silly at times  but a great guy and gets his point across well. Wonderful mentor and you can learn a lot from him if you try.
5,I LOVED Hal Blythe!! Wonderful professor!
4.5,Fabulous Professor!
5,Take This Teacher if you can!!! He is awesome awesome awesome!!! I still email him sometimes even though I've been out of his class for a long time. He's a great teacher and a great person.
5,Awesome teacher... never had any problems... Highly recommend.
5,Dr. Blythe is good at keeping your attention. Class material is easily organized. I liked Dr. Blythe's teaching style so much that I took him again for ENG 212.
4,Clear and organized notes.
5,He keeps your attention in lecture  and will go out of his way to help.
5,Great teacher  I would definitely take him again. He keeps you interested and actually cares about the students not just his job.
5,Hal Blythe is a very good teacher and he is actually interested in his students  not just his job.
3.5,A down to earth  approachable  fun  super nice guy. Still works as an administrator. Has lots of stories to tell. Open discussions can be engaging. There is some paper writing but it's well within reason. Gives options for the final project which was appreciated.
5,A lot of reading outside of class  but class itself isn't stressful. He's very nice  and realizes that his students have lives outside the classroom.
3,I ditto what has already been stated!
3.5,You'll spend a lot of time outside the classroom reading the text and writing summaries and a lot of time inside the classroom watching videos. If you keep up with the assignments it's tough to fail this one.
5,No Comments
2,Be prepared to STUDY a lot.
2,His lectures are awful! He'll go on these long rants about random things  and half the time you won't know what he is even talking about. His tests are HEAVY on material  very tough to study for. The one thing I did like about the class is the analysis paper we wrote.
5,If you are looking for an easy A do not take him. He is a great teacher  he knows what he is talking about. If you go above and beyond on the world he gives you  he rewards you with bonus points. I would recommend him but not if you are looking for a easy grade.
3,Dr. Curra is a great person. He really knows what he is talking about. Unfortunately  he will lecture from the start to the end of class without taking a break. There is so much information  and a lot of it is unclear. His tests are extremely hard. Don't take him if you are looking for an easy A.
5,Great professor and probably one of the most intellegent teachers I've ever met. The test however are extreamly hard and you are expected to remember a lot to pass.
5,Dr. Curra really cares for his students. He is very helpful and will do whatever it takes to help and encourage his students to succeed. Yes  the tests can be hard. Just read the material and pay attention to his lectures and you'll do fine! He knows what he's talking about and he's a very intelligent individual. Communicate with & you'll do great!
5,Animated  intelligent  humorous  clear expectations  takes notes  read  prepare for exams and make a good grade. Do not expect to pass without being diligent. The best professor I have ever taken   including graduate school
2,Great guy but horrible professor. He does not teach from the book. He likes to pull from his previous lectures  even though it is not always correct according to the book. Like I said  great all around guy but horrible at teaching.
2,I did not get the grade i wanted and he is difficult. But he knows what he is talking about. Very smart man. To get an A in the class you HAVE to keep up with readings. Does give study guides though which are some what helpful
4.5,Best professor I ever had- nearly convinced me to change my major to Sociology. He made a couple of the most difficult classes I had also the most enjoyable. Arrogant? Yes. Charming? Yes. Inspirational? That too. Probably would have inspired me to like Algebra  too  if he had taught it.
4,Straight facts: His tests are difficult  he usually never has homework(depending on which class you take)  he will share information or images from criminal minds with you that you will find no where else  and he will make you grow as a CRJ/PLS major. He is hard but necessary. Attend class and you will pass. Excellent professor.
1,This is the worst professor I've had in my entire college career. I am an A student but I've never been so frustrated. He drones for 3 hours about nothing but expects us you to know everything (plus stuff he hasn't covered come test time). He is not helpful and is arrogant! The study guides for tests are also over 100 pages with uncovered material!
1,This was the worst professor I have had in my entire college career. I am an A student and I have never been more frustrated and aggravated with a class or proffessor! He is a terrible lecturer and he drones on and on for three hours about nothing of importance but expects us to know everything come test time! His study guides were over 100 pages!
4.5,Fantastic professor - probably the best I've ever had. Very informative and entertaining. Lots to read and lots of notes to take  but if you do your part he will do his. He no longer teaches SOC131 as he's moving to the Crim Jus side of campus  but if you have the chance to take a class of his you won't regret it.
4,Very interesting man with lots of things to talk about in class. He's a good teacher but you only get grades for tests. He does give extra credit sometimes but you have to attend class to get it! Also gives study guides for everything.
4,He is a fun professor  but there is a lot of reading to keep up with.
4.5,He is probably my favorite professor on campus! You have to work hard  but it pays off at the end of the semester. READ the books there are a TON of questions from them on the exams. ENJOY!! :)
5,Wonderful professor. Class will be difficult if you don't read. (alot of reading is required). You will be amazed by him. He is so animated and is a wealth of knowledge. Course uses 3 books (he has on reserve at library if you dont want to buy them. At end of semester you do murder profile. HIGHLY RECCOMMEND! Just be reasdy to work in his class!!
3.5,Great class  but there's a lot of reading to keep up with.
4,Dr. Curra is the best professor I've ever had. Pay attention  take good notes  and read what he tells you and you will do fine.
4,I overall enjoyed Charles's class. However  he IS pretty disorganized at times. He does drone on often like people say but I really appreciate how passionate he is about what hes talking about. Hes flexible with late papers but hes also a tough grader!!! People complain about him being boring but hes a really nice professor and an invested guy.
4,Yes he's a bit of a low talker (it doesn't help that he leaves the door open)  but I found him to be very nice and helpful with regards to assignments. Some of the lectures tended to drag a little from time to time  but he did a good job of laying out the structure of the course  as well as explaining his expectations for our papers and exams.
3,Mixed feeling. He is really nice. But his voice is just too quiet and I cannot follow from time to time because of that!
5,He is just a lovely person! Excellent one-on-one so take advantage of office hours. Soft-spoken so you have to really listen but his lectures are always incredibly thorough and interesting. He also seems genuinely interested in what students have to say. His laugh is also the most adorable sound I've heard out of a grown man - highly recommend him!
4,Make sure you either do the readings and look over powerpoint slides or attend every class
5,Best pick for supervisor. Provides detailed feedback. VERY respected and insightful. Lectures get long and tedious  but he provides you with all the info you need for essays. Read the material for multiple choice not just slides. SWEETEST prof. on St Pats. Often given the street name OBrizzle. Because he is our homeboy. WE LOVE HIM.
4,He's really into musical films and gives very clear lectures but he can be rather repetitive and drag on subjects. Also  he is incredibly soft-spoken. Sometimes you can't hear him over the classroom's central heating. He uploads lecture slides and assigns readings. Study all that and you barely have to come in for class.
5,Hes an overall great guy who's passion for films is evidently conveyed through he's lectures and comments. He has helped me become more critical in my analyzing of films and has created my love for French New wave cinema.
1.5,He really loves film  but he makes you hate it. He can talk forever and he can really put you to sleep. For anyone who loves to sleep  I recommend this class.
4,Professor O'Brien is awesome. He's such a kind and calm guy  I'd take a class again with him in a heartbeat. (And yes  he talks quietly. Listen well  it's worth it.)
5,He had this Peter Parker /Clark Kent quality about hom that was sooooo sweet. His class was awesome.
4,I'm often torn on my opinion of this guy. He takes a very practical  historical approach to film studies which is refreshing considering how bogged down his department is in heavy theory. Fascinating and useful research interests  but he's so quiet he barely seems to even be there at times. He doesn't lecture so much as recite lullabies.
3,Charles O'Brien  never had I had such mixed feelings about a prof. He is a very nice guy who I believe cares about his students. Yes  he is a little awkward and stutters a bit and can't convey his ideas with clarity or precision but he is easygoing (unless you talk) and plans the course out nicely. The exams are super easy multiple choice.
4.5,Not a bad prof. Movies are standard film studies stuff. Super easy exams. Everything is from the texbook. Essays are pretty fair. If you do the readings and watch the movies online you don't even have to come to class. I skipped the entire second semester and got an A.
4,Possibly the coolest prof ever  and he doesn't even know it. He is really into his teaching  but can get boring sometimes and put you to sleep. Midterms and exams all multiple choice and easy. The O'Brien's a genius. Who always wears jean jackets :D
3,It's a fun course  but wow  the lectures are dull. It's too bad because he seems so into what he's saying  but the vast majority of his lectures are from the textbook. Still  he knows what he's talking about and posts the notes online (thank goodness: some slides hold multiple paragraphs!). It's worth taking his class  but bring along a coffee.
1.5,i once even saw his assistant/ta fall asleep and then wake up at the end drooling  he puts everyone asleep
1.5,his voice puts me to sleep  and when i am discussing his points with fellow classmates  someone always shushes me because o'brian is talking about a quotation taken from a book talking about a reviewer of the director of the movie were watching....hes a dud  and he cancelled blade runner :(
4,Great prof. Always really into his lectures. Extremely approachable and helpful. No suprises in exams or essays as long as you attend and keep up with class lectures. Very knowledgable.
4.5,Super great class!
5,Tracy is awesome. If you have the chance to take one of her classes you should. I also felt like i understood the content of the class and ended the course more knowledgeable. She doesnt make class stressful and she wants you to do well. Tracy is a good role model.
4.5,Shocker  she actually makes you ?read the textbooks?. This does not feel so scandalous to me
4.5,I don't know what the others are complaining about. Tracy is VERY clear! We had NO test in my class. She is into group discussions  but she tries to get you to think about the material. I heard 1 guy say she didn't teach him but he was the guy who begged answers off people and tried to cheat his way through school. Tracy is patient & knowledgeable.
1,Teacher doesn't provide much help. She isn't clear on what she wants and would rather her students copy from the book than put what they learned.
1.5,"Ugh - very unclear about what she ""actually"" wants... would rather have students unknowingly quote stuff directly from the book than try to understand it/put it in their own words... tests are unclear... not very understanding of circumstances beyond your control... normally like psych but very disinterested with this class/teacher... shame."
2,She never taught at all  just put us in groups. I totally disagree with the other comments saying she is easy. Her tests have nothing to do with what she has talked about in class. Would not ever take another class from her again  but she seemed like a nice lady nun the less
2,"Talked about the book  provided no real world explanations to abnormal psy  showed movies to try and get the point across... was way too much into ""group"" work..."
5,Anyone needing a PSY class should take Tracy. She makes class fun  and tailors her classes according to the overall character of each class. She pays attention to what is going on with everyone  and helps out however she can. Tracy Rocks!
5,An excellent instructor! Do your reading  participate in class  and you'll make A's--guaranteed. She's very understanding and flexible.
5,If you read the textbook and understand the meaning behind the group activities you will do very well in her class.
4,No Comments
5,Very Nice and Understanding. Good teacher. Fun.
2,Should teach more and have fewer group activities to fill time.
3,SHould consider providing more intellectual depth to her classes. Superficial - teaches the textbook.
2.5,No Comments
3,If you are a Republican/Christian beware to hear some controversial things. She's pretty straight forward on what she wants from you. Your grade is based on book quizzes and film quizzes. She's a nice and caring person  but can sometimes inject her opinion too much. Everything is basically online except the midterm and final.
5,Dr. Carmean is a great professor and I'm excited to take another class with her! 1 worksheet on a 50-or-so minute film and a quiz over the book every week. No actual textbook  but you do have to read two books. Show up to class! Take it seriously! You will be better off for it!
4,She is an amazing professor. She is passionate about her field. She loves her students. She is always available to talk in her office.
4,She is an amazing professor. She is passionate about her field. She loves her students.
4.5,Carmean makes it very clear what is required to get an A. If you do what she says (and do it well)  an A is pretty much guaranteed. Take good notes. Carmean really loves this subject  and she enjoys it when students express interest or enjoyment as well. If you go into the class with a good attitude  it'll go a lot better.
4.5,Writing this mostly as a rebuttal to the last comment posted. I worked on the final by myself & received an A on it  as well as for the final course grade. Granted  it took me around 5 hours to complete. Attend class  take notes  pay attention  & ask questions if you're unsure of something. Dr. Carmean is a good professor.
3,Passionate professor  the work is tedious but straight forward and not too difficult. She is a good professor
5,if your gonna do ANT she is the teacher to go with. her passion for the subject shines through her teaching making me care about the subject. her teaching style grabs attention and is easily understood. you will need to read guns  germs  and steel but because she broke it down weekly  its not as painful.
2.5,She's awful! She still uses a chalk board  writes notes that are impossible to follow  draws pictures instead of using Powerpoint or other forms of technology  and is totally full of herself! I cannot stand this woman. The Final Exam has absolutely nothing to do with what we learned in class.
5,"Kelli loves Anthropology and it is easy to see through her teaching. The first day of my first class was intimidating because she really throws the work at you but I believe it's just to let you know ""this is not an easy A class fellows"". I ended up taking a class from her every year I was at EKU so I guess you could say I like her pretty good."
1.5,Marxist  feminest  arrogant... Her classes are more about her political agenda than the science of archaeology. Too bad she is the only archaeologist on the faculty at EKU.
1,her notes are impossible to follow. she writes all over the bored and never finishes a thought. whenever you ask a question regarding an answer on a test  she sayd she'll consider it for next semester. i would not recommend her
4.5,She is really nice and very enthusiastic about teaching  she made boring subjects beyond interesting  the class was challenging  no textbook but i learned a lot. If you like anth. take it she is cool.
5,She is super nice and helpful! The class is really interesting because Dr. Carmean created it herself. She loves her job and is always willing to help. If you do the reading and review your notes before the exams you'll be fine. She doesn't like grading so all the exams are multiple choise. She posts grades really fast too! Great Teacher!
4.5,Really nice lady she is very enthusiastic about what she does. Her class is very hard but I learned alot and she is a great teacher. you just have to work hard if you want a good grade :)
4.5,Wonderful professor. She is very energetic and driven. No homework other than reading. Takes attendance randomly. Gives study guides for her tests. The only downside is the amount of reading required. There are three books that must be read  and read carefully  for this class. I suggest you make a friend in the class and study for the book exams.
3.5,She's nice  but pretty crazy. Guns Germs and Steel tests are horrible and the tests are hard. And seriously  she is CERTIFIABLE!!! But in a nice way :)
4.5,She is super sweet but her class is hard. There is a nest test (book) we had to do and it was really difficult to predict what questions would be on there  so you didn't know which point of the book to really pay attention to. But over all she's great  just make sure you do all the work assigned  including the study guide 
5,Dr. Carmean is my academic advisor and has helped me in so many ways! Her classes are by no means easy...but they are a lot of fun. You can tell that she really gets into some anthropology! If you have the chance you should take her...actually  make it a point to take her. You will not regret it...but you will work hard!
5,wonderful professor. Very clear about what she expects  and very helpful. Seems to enjoy teaching and wants her students to learn and understand the material.
1,The instructor focused more on criticising students than helping them to learn and succeed. Thus  I was not at all satisfied with her approach to treating students  particularly those who did not speak English as their mother tongue
1,She marks too hard for the quality of her classes and her overall knowledge as an ESL instructor is poor. Her explanations are vague  her spelling terrible and she deducts marks for corrections that people at the writing centre make on your essays. Her comments will not help you at all. She gives you whatever grade she wants to. HORRIBLE!!!
5,Very interesting person and class is always interesting too.
4.5,She is organized in her lectures and her assignments are pretty straightforward. Take notes of whatever she mentions in class. She grades students on participation too (15%). So  make an effort to participate in class daily. Her exams are based on lecture material covered in class. So  attending class is very important.
2,Don't take her course  If you want get high marks. she never give high marks.
2,Very boring class.
5,She is very interesting and tells you about different people in Canada in a very friendly way. It is an interesting class.
5,GREAT! INTERESTING!
2,She acts nice but she likes certain students. If you start to get B or B+  that means she just does not like you. You will find a lot of people getting A or A+ in the course just for being a friend with her. If you get into any type of argument  your grades will get lower.
5,Great
5,She is strict about cell phones and stuff but she teaches how to write. You should take her course!
4,Very kind  considerate  respects her students and expects respect in return. Doesn't allow baseball hats  cell phones  people resting their feet on the seat in front of them  late comers. Gives full attention and expects the same from her students. In addition  very stylish  elegant  and beautiful. Great teacher when students behave accordingly.
5,At the beginning its like she is hard but she's really  really nice.
5,You can get a really good mark if you always go to the class. But don't miss because she asks questions from the class in the exam.
5,She is very fair and gives good grades. But if you are academic dishonesty she will catch you.
5,I learn a lot about multiculturalism. Very interesting.
5,Wow! What surprise that Canada is very interesting.
5,I could not pass the course if Courtney didnt' help me so much. Very nice person.
5,WOW! You should try to get in her class because she really helps a lot and i'm really glad she teaches how to write good essay.
5,I learned so much about Canada and Courtney made me feel not so worried in a new country.
2,What a funny guy yet such a horrible professor. All he does is draw little figures and mumble. Tests and final are take home. Doesn't teach. All he care about is project project project. Worst part is he teaches 4 major classes and he is only professor for both of them.
5,I have had few classes with Dr. Aabdullah. After first class I took with him I was looking for classes he was taking in next semester so that I can avail them. Very helpful and has clarity in teaching. Would go extra mile to explain something if students are not following.
1,He is the reason I changed schools. This is the poorest Computer Science experience I've had. I suggest that other students complain to higher-ups about him  change majors or go elsewhere for CS. I wonder why this department is doing so poorly when this area should be booming...
1,The worst professor so far at NJCU''s CS Department. He cannot teach...I''ll tell you why He draws little figures on the board while mumbling something and expects to see notes. He picks on random students sometimes one student a lot and asks a question to put you on the spot. If you don''t answer correctly he''ll assume your grade from that.
3,Class was overall easy. The professor responded quickly to e-mails and was helping.
5,Purely the only professor in NJCU who knows his Computer Science. I am not joking he is the best thing in that department. three tests which includes midterm and finals in the three tests. projects are really simple. wants work but because of him i got a job as a software engineer. I cant thank him enough for all his help to me. Never stop teaching
2,Great guy but very bad teacher. Does not know how to teach at all. He talks as if everything he says should be common sense.
3,Awesome teacher. I recommend him.
5,Took the online course. It may seem like a lot of work  but its not that difficult. Take his class if possible.
5,For all non major students take him he is crystal clear in his syllabus for homework and tests and will help you learn. He treats you like an adult that you are and he will give you an A- atleast for effort.
4.5,easy class  eventhough the prof had some difficultes in talking  sometimes unclear  overall good class spirit.
3.5,He is a lovely older man. Easy going and friendly. Teaches you as though you were an adult. Test come from the HW - directly. I recommend him for an easy and enjoyable class.
5,I took Prof. Aabdollah's CS115 online class. He was crystal clear in his directions  and he responded to emails quickly and in a respectful manner. I suggest taking his class  and I wouldn't think twice about taking an inClass couse  also.
4,Wonderful person - easy class. You have to really TRY to fail this class.
4,A very nice man that won't give you a lot of hassle. He treats you like an adult. Homework and exam come from the questions at the end of each chapter in the book. His English is not the best  but anyone can excel easily in his class if you do the HW. I highly recommend him.
5,Professor gives a lot of work  but he is really easy. Very kind! If you do your work you will get an A.
3.5,He is a good professor  lots of HW  test are directly from HW.. Gives you extra time to make up any HW missed... Curves
3,horrible
4,The class was rather simple. So long as you did the homework each week  which was just answering the questions at the end of each chapter  you will pass. Tests consisted of 10 of the homework questions. There was one relatively short paper that was on a topic he gives you. It was a pretty easy class to fill an area.
3,A difficult professor if you'r lazy like me. Lots of homework and the tests are from the hw. Final project seemed difficult based on what I saw others do. (I didn't do it but still passed only because I handed in literally 17 chapters of past homework on the last day.) Not the worst CS professor but I won't take him again.
5,Great class! But make sure you attand lectures and don't have anyone signin for you because I did it and I got into some trubles  my grades when down a lot because of that. Overall  I loved his class  it was fun and I recommend everyone to take it!
4,This was probably the easiest class of all four years  and very fun. He tries to get to know the students  but doesn't really know all so you could just get a friend to sign you in and you would be marked present. He definitely knows his facts so make sure your powerpoints have lots of pics of the correct places!
5,very easy class  just make sure you study for his tests and hand in the paper on time. class is interesting he can be kind of boring though sometimes. great professor.
5,One of my fav. teachers in the University...so easy...no homework but you have like 2 or 3 projects..there easy too...he says attendance is mandatory and u get 3 cuts or he lowers your grade...but thats not completely true unless you miss a lotttt ...so easy...def. reccommend takin this class !!
4,Suetta is the best teacher around. Just go to class and pay attention. He makes you want to pay attention. Funny guy.
5,he is the best history teacher i have ever had... he is the man.. if you want an easy A take suetta
5,he is the best history teacher i have ever had... he is the man.. if you want an easy A take suetta
5,"What can I say  Suetta is the man! East Asia is the easiest class during my week. Hilarious everyday. Very passionate and knowledgable in his lectures. It's crazy how he picked up his Asian accent. Look forward to watching the film ""Tampopo""...it's hysterical! If you want a fun class with an almost guaranteed A  TAKE SUETTA!"
5,Suetta is the man
5,He really makes you think about what is around you. Absolutely A-F***ing-mazing teacher
5,HE's one awsome teacher!!!
5,this guy was so cool it makes me wanna be an asian
5,This class is awesome  he is really entertaining with his lectures  interesting and easy
4.5,interesting class  but uses a powerpoint. very nice teacher  easy grader  very easy tests. and two also easy papers to write. take it!
5,I LOVE SUETTA!
3.5,lectures were fairly boring with a few corny jokes thrown in. takes attendence every day which is the only reason i went to class. he was actually rude to me when i would say hello to him outside of class  he didn't have a clue who i was so he would just ignore me! great study directions  easy tests
5,Really nice  prob the nicest prof. I've ever had and really informative. If he still shows the movie about the noodle  watch out because you'll have a ton of fun watching it and be quite surprised!. I def. reccommend him!
5,He's the best professor! I wouldn't miss his class ever. I like his stories. He knows so much about east asia... I highly recommend this class...
5,makes an otherwise boring subject interesting and fun  i wouldnt miss his class if u paid me
5,this was the best class in the world  never wanted to go to a lecture so much  hilarious guy but lectures so well you enjoy it and remember everything. TAKE EAST ASIA
1,My high school football coach could teach better than this man. Attendance is taken through clicker quizzes that have huge effect on grades. He is extremely rude 1 on 1 and belittles students. No formula sheet so good luck memorizing all the equations for the final. I guess studying 20 hrs for the final isn't good enough to pass. 50% averages rip:)
2,Bakker is rude and condescending  but his class isn't too hard. He moves fast and doesn't thoroughly explain everything  but the book does and his tests aren't overly complicated. He does lots of clicker quizzes which can be stressful at times.
3,Martin is very difficult  so if you're not taking this for future classes beware. He's probably the best out of all 102 profs  but you need to do so many extra practice probs to pass. Study 1 week+ before the test  no matter what. He can be rude  but you need to put it the work. He is the best @ concept/math balance so if you need future chem do it
3,I had him for both 101 and 102. If you're taking 101 as an elective or as an engineering major  DO NOT TAKE HIM. If you're premed or chemistry related major  power through and you will learn a ton  which helps in later courses. Tests are hard but if you put in the work and do a lot of practice problems it's doable.
5,Great teacher. Kind of rude at points  but you will definitely know Chemistry by the end. He is hard but fair and makes you work for your grade. You don't get formula sheets for the test  but with enough practice they're fairly easy to remember. Take this guy if you can!
5,Dr. Bakker is very prepared for lectures and is great about answering questions in class and outside of class. He loves to see his students putting in effort  so go to office hours when you have questions and attend as many recitations as possible (his quizzes there help a lot  too!) Use all extra problems he gives and it will help for the tests.
4,A good lecturer  if not a bit arrogant. He's the kind of professor you hate to have while you have him  but will be grateful for after you leave him. However  I'd only recommend his class if you're going to being using chemistry in future courses. It was a lot of effort  and very stressful.
1,This guy is awful. He insults people in class and makes a fuss if anyone asks him to work a problem. Has clicker questions every class period and only gives half credit to wrong answers  even though it's an attendance grade. Tests were ridiculously difficult  and he never curved  even though test averages were in the 50s. Rudest prof I've ever had.
2,If you ask a question in class there is a big chance he will condescend to you in front of everyone  and you will never ask another question again. You go through the homework and feel like you will do well just to bomb tests. Part of why the tests are so awful is because he doesn't provide any formulas or constants unlike every other professor.
1,Avoid if possible. He is very smart & he knows it  often being rude to students in class and answering questions with other questions. If you haven't taken AP Chem  he is not the prof for you. His hw isn't impossible if you start ahead of time  but I study & understand the material & attend every class and still do badly on his tests.
5,Dr. Bakker is as good of a chemistry teacher as it gets honestly. He uploads class lectures and does a great job explaining the math side of the class  which is normally where chemistry teachers struggle. Alot of people have dropped or have bad grades but this isnt an easy class but if you put in effort you will do fine. highly recommend
4,Dr. Bakker gets a lot of negative reviews  but I absolutely loved him! He can be a bit condescending if you ask stupid questions  but do the reading and it's an easy A. He teaches straight from the textbook  so I recommend reading ahead of time then going to lecture to clear up anything that you're confused on.
1,Make sure you do as many practice problems as you can to prepare for the test. The test will be much harder then other classes so study and put in the hours. There is no clear grading criteria even though he says there is in the syllabus. I still have no idea what my final numeric grade was. Take a different professor if at all possible
1,Take another teacher. He'll do problems in class & make sarcastic comments about how much faster he can do them. Tests much harder with trick questions than other sections & u don't get to use formula sheet on final. You might learn more in his class but you are unlikely to get in A unless you've had AP chem and grading criteria not clear.
3,Dr. Bakker is a very tough teacher but he knows what he is talking about and will prepare you well for future classes if you put the work in. All the basics for the tests are in the powerpoints but in order to do well you need to do a lot of practice problems. Definitely don't take if you're just taking for a science elective.
1,Dr. Bakker's class was very difficult and not to be taken lightly. During class he tries to be funny  but often goes over as rude and demeaning. He has many times worked a problem out on the board and not explained where he gets the numbers from. He seems like a brilliant man  but not very good at teaching. I wouldn't recommend taking him.
4,He is very condescending. Drops your lowest test grade. Expects a lot out of his students  and the ones who try come out with an incredible amount of knowledge.
3,I had Dr. Bakker for both 101 and 102 and it was one of the hardest classes I have ever had to take. He expects a lot and pushes his students to the limit. I hated his class and thought it was very hard but I learned a lot more than other students with other teachers which will and has helped me with other classes.
2,Gives lectures mostly on concepts and theory with very few example problems and expects you to learn how to do most problems on your own. He does clicker questions for a grade every class. I would not recommend him to anyone who does not have a strong chemistry background. He also gives no equation sheets for exams.
2,While he does not give as much homework as some of the other professors  he likes to assign it on a very short deadline (I.E. finish the chapter on monday  homework is pushed up to be due that wednesday). Attendance was required as he gave in class clicker questions everyday that count as participation (but also are graded). Kinda sassy guy.
2.5,She is SUPER easy and hilarious. The only negative thing was that her grading on the essays was very inconsistent. I would take her again though because you don't really have to focus in there outside of class. lol
5,She is the most awesome English teacher that I have ever had. Her class is easy and fun. She is hilarious and always cracks the students up. Mostly  we only wrote essay and turned in-class work in for homework. Our tests were in-class essays.
5,The best English teacher at NACC. Dr. Huntley is funny  intelligent  thorough  and interesting. If you hate English like me  take her
5,She is hilarious and a great teacher. I learned more in there than my high school English class on essay papers. She sometimes let the students out early which is cool for me. Make sure you follow the guidelines she gives to essay papers to make an A.
3,ask too much detail in her essay's and if u dnt have it she will minus every point till u have em.
5,Super awesome teacher!!!!
4.5,Great teacher! Took three different classes with her. Definitely my favorite!
3,Very lenient
5,Dr. Huntley is Awesome. She is extremely easy too
3,great
5,Dr. Huntley is a doll with a smile that dont quit.She is always fair that is to pick on everyone. She's a hottie
5,I've never had so much fun learning english as with this wonderful funny smart and HOT teacher.
5,Dr. Huntly is up on the latest things  her way of teaching is brillent with a fell of one on one in a room packed.She's HOT
5,Dr. Huntley is a wonderful instructor! She's not easy--she's a former lawyer. Our final exam was an in-class research paper. Inspiring teacher and true friend.
5,Love this lady!!!! If your not a good writer  like me  she explains everything well. It also helps you when writing papers for other classes.
5,Boo AU  but Hooray Dr. Huntley!! Best overall teacher @ NACC in my opinion. I had Dr. H in both English & Lit classes. Register ASAP to get in her classes!!
4.5,I loved Dr. Huntley's classes. I always looked for the classes she taught because I knew they would be interesting and easy as long as I applied myself. I highly recommend.
5,Great teacher!!!!!
5,No Comments
5,Dr. H is an amazing teacher! She's funny  insightful  and she knows her material. Expect to work hard and study often. She likes students to be involved in class discussions. She doesn't play around with work
3,Very strange  but if you get on his good side  you'll prosper in the class. You have to write like him in order to make a good grade. Tests are relatively easy  while papers have to be dead-on accurate....
4,Quirky character  but once you get past his eccentricities he's a great professor and really does care about his students. He even took our whole class out to lunch one day. He just doesnxe2x80x99t tolerate people with a half-hearted interest in the subject very well. Firm grader. Excellent lecturer. Good material to know in world affairs these days.
3,Pretty funny but odd guy  has been teaching here for 50 years. Insensitive but kind-hearted
4,Dr. Robel is a difficult professor to like. He insults and belittles his students and he is inflexible in his opinions
5,He is a great lecturer. He loves teaching and it shows.
5,Dr. Robel is an excellent professor! His teaching methods are inspiring - he's fun and enthusiastic.
1,No Comments
3,Good teacher..tough grader...4 essays for mini semester classes. She will tell you straight up in you face whatever you need to do and I loved that about her. Just take her and dedicate your time your in college for reason. You will learn
1,This lecturer was not there online. She marked our very first essay  but then disappeared until three days to the semester's end! She then hurriedly graded our work  but because she had not been there to instruct us  we had made no improvements in our work. only two students completed the research paper by last day of semester!
4.5,I am still in her class now so I will rate her again once I am finished. Very thorough with explanations  course work is not too hard but it is challenging. Instructor helps when needed and is very quick with responses.
3.5,Very tuff class! You must work hard and she expects a lot from the class. Lots of essays to write and the Final paper is 2500-3000 words. You must study and read.
2,I learned a lot from Dr. Young. She likes students who don't ask a lot of questions and take the initiative themselves.
4.5,Ms.Young  Is a great professor I have learned so much from attending her class. You must be willing to work hard but in the end you will feel confident with English. I highly recommend Ms. Young's class.
4.5,Ms Young is a great teacher. She is extremely helpful and very responsive to any questions. She lets you learn and does not expect you to be perfect. She lets you revise your paper to make a better grade.
5,She was awesome took her online she responed quickly and prompt she gives you a second chance to edit and revise if necessary!!! Awesome for an online class!!!
5,Ms Young is a great teacher. If your a slacker don't waste your time  but if you like writing  honest critiques and good conversations  she's great! Take her. You will learn about literary culture and how to improve your writing.
5,just go head and take her class..dont ask too much questions in her class
5,SHES A GREAT TEACHER. GETS RIGHT TO THE POINT  TELLS YOU WHAT SHE EXPECTS AND GIVES A SECOND CHANCE TO CORRECT YOUR ESSAYS IF UNSATISFACTORY.
5,its a easy teacher  its fun to take her class
3,she speaks directly to the people who have read the assignments. She get frustrated very easyly if you do not complete assignments the way that she wants.
5,I LOVE HER!!! She is a great teacher  she keeps you interested in what she's saying  and sometimes you get a nice laugh. You have to do your work to get a good grade  but she's willling to help you if there's something wrong. She's very easy to talk to. She just doesnt put up with bull****. Again  GREAT teacher  i recommend for eveyone!
4.5,DAMN HER EYE BALL SCARES ME! GOOD TECAHER.I RECOMMEND HER MEAN SELF.
5,Dr. Young is an excellent professor. she makes you use what the good Lord has blessed you with (ya brain). she is also very helpful  and her classes are fun. I use to look forward to attending her classes last semeter.
4.5,Dr. Young is a great teacher IF you are willing to put in the effort on her assignments. She grades reasonably and is always willing to help if you need it.
3.5,She is a really good techer. Everyone looked forward to her class. But be prepared to have your essays read aloud in the class and picked at  but it will essentially help you to become a better writer when you know that your peers will view your paper.
5,Dr. Young is a great professor. She picks through papers & reads them aloud   not to embarrass you  but to help you see & hear your mistakes & show others in the class what mistakes they may've made. She's very cool but you will have an essay every week but she allows you to talk about things you like so it's not too hard. Grade A teacher!!
1,she will try and scare you early on. your first paper will be read aloud as she picks it apart and tries to embarass you. you wont have to read a thing if you know how to go to cliffnotes.com or pinkmonkey.com.its better than reading that garbage she has selected for the readings
4,Her class is amazing I love her lectures and she is very helpful and easy accessible. Her test are easy if you study. I am going to miss her class.
1,I took this class in spring of 2007. This woman is highly intelligent  but if you aren't one of her favorites  then she will be rude to you. I just asked just 1 question in class during the 4 mos  she shut me up. I didn't learn anything from this class. I wasted my money on the text book.
5,Professor Zeigler is dope. I took her Environmental Science (and lab) class at GPC Clarkston and her class is cool. Lectures are Power point-based and quizzes are based on those power points. 1 research paper which isn't hard at all. Easy class and cool teacher overall.
5,Dr. Zeigler obviously loves teaching and talking about science  and she does so very well. She engages students in the lectures  but still stays on topic. Best science teacher I've ever had.
4.5,Z. is a great teacher  knowledgeable & passionate for her subject. Her lectures are clear  to the point  and often hilarious. I'm surprised by how much I learned bec. the class seems so casual  but I found myself retaining most of the material. Its been almost a year since I took her class and I can still identify rocks and minerals on the fly.
4,Professor is both knowledgeable and caring. She wants her students to succeed and is willing to work with you. BUY/RENT THE BOOK  you'll need it for the test and quizzes. Also  if you can take her for both lecture and lab (hurry her classes fill up fast).
5,Best teacher ever! Willing to help. Test are exactly the powerpoints and in class discussion. Scantron test. Give up to 10pts on the adverage at the end of the semester. Dont have tobuy the book. Great if ur not good at science.
5,She is AWESOME! Material is on power point. She gives you what to study on ALL quizzes  midterm  and test.Do exactly what she says. Extra credit is easy. Portfolio is optional  and apart of extra credit.
5,THIS professor is GREAT! I had her at 8:30 in the morning and I made it through without missing one day. She expects you to be in class and ready. She gives you everything you need in her power points-just use those and go to class and you too will receive an A. Good Luck. She gives a nice amount of extra credit but you should not have to use it.
5,Prof. Zeigler is a great professor. I've taken her for two classes  and really enjoyed it. She knows her subjects  and makes class interesting. I definitely recommend her!
5,Professor Zeigler is one of my favorite instructors that I have taken. She make class interesting and fun. I would tell anyone to take her. She is what all students should hope for when signing up for a class
5,This is a great professor. She explains things very clearly  and really enjoys her job. Her tests can be a bit tricky because there is a lot of information covered  but if you study your notes and do well on the quizzes and research paper  you'll do great. We had a lot of fun this semester.
5,VERY SWEET AND SMART LADY  I LEARNED SO MUCH OUT OF BOTH OF HER CLASSES TAKE HER YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED
4.5,Very good teacher class is easy....TAKE HER!!!!!
5,Test come straight from her lecture. So if you pay attention and take good notes you will pass no problem. She also lets you do test corrections for half of the points..
4,Prof. Zeigler was great! I really enjoyed her class. She makes the subject really fun  and teaches it on a level for students that AREN'T a Geology major. Class attendance wasn't mandatory  but if you didn't go  you might miss a quiz and the notes were important. Quizzes came straight from the notes. Would most definitely take her again!
5,Great teacher  great class very spontaneous an easy A if you pay attention and come to class everyday  I'm taking her spring 2010 for Geology and ENVS 1401 you will not get bored! Fun class
4,I took for Geology and Geology Lab  I like her class and got an A for both. Not hard at all just do what your suppose to do: STUDY!!  don't miss any of the quizes. She is not boring and tries to make geology fun. Totally recommended.
4,i failed her class bc my dumb ass missed too many lectures n quizzes. nevertheless ms zeigler is great! her class was easy  u dont need the book  just take notes n pay attention. her only downside is being non responsive to emails. other than that she will work w u  n she has a live personality..her lectures can be boring but i dont like science so
5,Awesome class! I don't know how the last guys said that her class was boring  I took ENVS from her as well. You get out what you put into the class I guess. Very rewarding class  teacher is very focused on making sure that you understand what is being taught  quite obvious that she loves the subject and loves her job! I'd take her again any day!
5,Mrs. Zrolka is the best  if you come to class  take notes and pay attention you shouldn't have a problem. If you're really struggling she is always in her office ready to help but you have to put in the work. If you're not a strong test taker or have a hard time grasping the material then you need to be her best friend but she will help you.
5,Mrs Zrolka is the best math in GSU Decatur take her you will not regret it. She gives out review for every test  all the quizzes are take home assignment. The test is not difficult if you study ahead and complete the review. she gives out extra credit  and the best part is she is so orangized. She is willing to help so use her office hours.
5,Best teacher ever! Posts her class notes on icollege which helped out when studying for final. Gave out extra credit. If you need help she will tutor you in her office after class. I highly recommend her!
5,BEST MATH TEACHER EVER! Come to class  do the work and its really no way to fail. I wish she taught every math there was lol. I would take her class again & again.
5,BEST COLLEGE ALGEBRA TEACHER ON CAMPUS !! Math was my worst subject  but her teaching techniques are amazing and will help you better understand the math. Come to class  do your homework  and the extra credit and you will pass the class. I left this class with an A !!
4.5,Very nice professor with very nice lectures. She's a lot of help and makes math fun and easy.
5,From day 1 Mrs. Z told us to see her for tutoring from day 1 I did with a group of my peers and it helps immensely I am passing her class with a 94% mind you I haven't been in school in a decade she has helped everything make sense again she rocks
5,Best math teacher ever. she is clear precise and will help you with whatever you need. j ma sure you have a graphing calculator as long as you have that you will pass. even are the worst person at math. I had a consistent A/B in her class until I missed a review(and she reviews everything before a test!!) and I got a few 79's!! she is awesome!!!!!!
4,I took Ms.Zrolka Fall 2012   she is a good teacher if you understand math as far as grading she takes off points for EVERYTHING. I honestly believe i could've passed her class. She gives good notes and leaves them on iCollege during the semester  she gives a quiz for EVERY chapter but her quizzes are easy and She teaches really fast.
5,Ms Zoroka is soooo awesome  love her! I would honestly recommend her to anyone she's very helpful  fair and very clear on what she wants. I took her for 1111 and pass with an A. Make sure you bring your calculators 83 or 84 everyday and attendance is mandatory. Great teacher  i would take her again and again if i could LOL.
5,The best Math Teacher I have ever had in my life. Go to class  pay attention  I also when to went to tutoring and I always got an A on every test  project  and homework. Gives AMPLE AMOUNTS of extra credit. Drops lowest test grade. Not great in Math well SHE WILL CHANGE THAT. MUST TAKE CLASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,She is a great teacher and just like anyone else if she see you are coming to class and really have a interest to learn the material she is always willing to help. She always allow time at the beginning of class to go over any problems from homework. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
4.5,She is very helpful. If you come to class everyday  she will give you extra credit on the final. Ask her fir questions and she will gladly help you. Math is tough but she will help you understand it.
5,This is one of the best teachers I've had since coming to GPC. She is patient and gives so many chances to make a better grade. She has bonuses coming out her ears. He demenor is pleseant she will only get mad when most the clas fails the test. If you DON'T LIKE Math you SHOULD TAKE HER  yes SHOULD she will get you through it. Oh and NO homework
5,Ms.Zorlka is the BEST precal teacher!!! She is very clear and makes sure everyone understands whats going on. We use the textbook for homework so you can get an understanding which i advise. She is very clear and always lets you revise your test and get extra points  we have projects and she gives extra credit. She is a wonderful teacher!!!!!!
5,She is a great professor. I did not have a book in her class and made an A. She uses mymathlab now and homework grades are easy. Take lots of notes and attend class.
5,She is extremely great professor you would ever have it for math. She is perfect for Math lovers. Even if you don't like Math  you would start loving it. I promise you .. you will not regret.
4.5,SHE IS THE BEST MATH TEACHER AT GPC BOTTOM LINE!!! TAKE HER!! I HAVE TAKEN HER FOR PRE CAL AND CAL I. SHE IS HELPFUL AND SHE KNOWS HOW TO TEACH. JUST MAKE SURE YOU ATTEND CLASS DO THE HOMEWORK  SEE HER IF YOU NEED HELP  ASK QUESTIONS AND YOU WILL PASS. SHE MAKES MATH FUN AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND I LOVE HER SHE IS THE BEST!!! :-)
5,She is the Greatest Teacher in GPC. You'll love math even if you never did before. She explains everything so well  you must get it  if you belong in college. She is just really Awsome.You'll learn a lot. Her tests & grades are very fair if you study. Do homeworks and Pay attention in Class you'll get an A. It is a great pleasure taking her class.
2.5,Her class notes are easy to understand but when she assigns the homework its not what was explained in class notes! I feel that she should do some of the even homework problems in class with us so that we can understand the homework better
1,Professor does not tell students about online projects due. Expects you to see something on blackboard (hope for your sake you log on everyday). Gives feedback on a paper and if you fix it still gives negative feedback for paper. Somewhat scattered on what she tells students. Would not recommend.
1,Failed to give constructive feedback on assignments that could be useful for improvement.
5,Great professor!! Tells you to the smallest detail what she expects in her papers. As long as you try you will get a good grade.
5,I loved that woman so much that I can't even put it into words. Hands down  one of the best instructors I have ever had in my life. She is not unreasonable in any way. She gives you clear instructions and pushes you to not be a procrastinator. She is incredibly lively and hilarious and her lectures are rarely boring. Take her course! That's it.
5,She's a wonderful professor. Intimidating at first  but very kind. She provides clarity on all her assignments. I would highly recommend her!
5,One of the best teachers I've had. She is funny  smart  and cheerful. She cares about her students and her job. Her assignments aren't hard and if they are she makes them as clear as can be. I loved her.
5,Shelly Hancock is one of my favorite instructors here at BCTC. She is so lively and passionate. He classes are almost never boring. Sometimes in her class  I felt as if my older sister was teaching me. She is just so friendly and fair. She gives you a hard time on essays  but that's because she cares about you. She wants you to become your best.
4.5,She is one of the best teachers so far. She is very helpful. When she is grading  she comments what is wrong about the paper so it will become better. Very helpful!!I wish I had taken her for 102 but sadly I didn't :(
3.5,She's a good teacher and a nice person  but the book she chose  which is about black women in the civil rights movement  is not at all my preference. But then  I am probably the most politically incorrect person I know.
5,She does everything but write the paper for you. I actually feel like I learned something in her class and had fun doing it.
4.5,Helpful teacher to any student and is easy to understand.
5,Took her for 101&102.By far the best teacher.Her classes get full easy so sign up early.If you come to class and do what she asks you will get a B easy.If you need help  she is there. Easy to talk to & extremely funny. Don't be discouraged by her loud voice. If you struggle in english  TAKE HER!
5,Everyone should take Shelly's classes  she is a wonderful teacher who works hard with you. Hilarious as well.
5,Shelly was great.. If you show up for class you understand everything she wants you to accomplish..she will help you if you just ask.. I would definitely take her other classes if I needed to..
4,Shes super coooool
5,Highly recommend her. Came out of class being able to write good college papers. Assignments can be unusual  but it makes you think about what you are going to write. Available for help  can phone at home during weekends  evenings  and holidays. Will help you expand your thought process.
4,She takes 50 point participation everday! Super easy class though!
4.5,Took Shelly for 101 and 102. She is a great teacher and willing to work with and help her students. Highly advise you to take her classes!
5,Shelly is by far the best she is very clear at the start what she expects and its up to you to so the work but she will go aove and beyond to help you with any problems you have I took her for 101  102 and a lit class just because i enjoyed her sooo much take her you wont be sorry
4,She's a little over the top  to the point where I'd even say she's annoying. She's obnoxious and loud  which can be cool but only in moderation. Sitting through an hour and a half class twice a week was a bit too much of Shelly for me.
3.5,dont take him. u will regret it if you care about your GPA. his class may seem easy at first but its really not. he tells u what will be on the test before hand but most of the things he says are not even on there. totally not worth it.
3.5,Academically  I would say he's a great teacher to take  but he is a shady person. He started a conflict in the class with a student who did nothing to anyone. I guess he didn't agree with his point of view  but sending a email off to everyone in class like your trying to get the person kicked out of school which is what he did was a bit extreme.
5,Take this guy!!! He is one of the best professors I have ever had! I learned so much from him  he is extremely funny  and he will tell what is on his exams! Even on my exams  in the free response section  there were times when I made up the answer and i was still given credit. Like I said  TAKE THIS GUY!!!!
5,Mr. Carter is a great teacher!! If you need to take this class  this is the teacher. He is extremely nice and very helpful.
5,Excellent!! He is awesome & funny  I learned so much.Take him you wont be sorry.
4,If you have to take this class and dont want to have to study too much. Carter is the guy to take. If you want to really learn something though he's not the guy. Super nice guy  but just didnt feel like I learned alot from his class. If you take him  get ready for ALOT of corny jokes.
5,Mr. Carter what a wonderful man. He's fun & funny. Loved his class best class I have taken so far..want to learn and have fun take this class  it's the smartest move you can make. MR. CARTER ROCKS
5,Mr. Carter is a wonderful teacher and man. He is extremely helpful and knows the subject very well. One of my favorite professors that I have ever had. I highly recommend him!
5,Professor Carter is very passionate about what he does. His teaching style is superb. He understands that students have life outside of college  but he also makes you want to read and learn the material. Very interesting class. Highly recommended
5,Very nice man..Easy grade..Love this guy
5,"Mr. Carter is the man. He make class very interesting and easy to understand. ""IF YOU DON'T TAKE HIS CLASS YOUR CRAZY"" EASY A++++++"
5,It doesn't get any better than this professor. You better thank your lucky stars if you can get into his class. Very refreshing  fun  interesting  and informative. His class is not boring AT ALL and you talk about real world concepts. I would reccommend anyone to take his class. Test come directly from his review and he is an EXTREMELY NICE MAN.
5,Mr. Carter is a very nice teacher...very easy and very helpful...he gives extra points on the test even if the answer is wrong...nobody will regret taking him!
5,This professor knows his stuff!! A very relaxed class  he is hilarious. REFRESHING. He uses today issues to show examples. Please take his class  you won't regret it!!!!!!! vb
5,GREAT PROFESSOR. I loved his class. He is very informative and made the class fun. TAKE HIS CLASS YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.
5,Mr. Carter is an excellent teacher. He makes his classes very interesting and very fun. He is everything you would ever want in a teacher. If you are lucky enough (and I mean lucky) to get into his class  you are guaranteed to have fun while learning.
5,He is an excellent example of what a teacher is suppose to be. I enjoyed his class. I would recommend that you take him. It does not get any better than him.
5,He is a wonderful teacher who wants to help all of his students succeed.
5,Take him!!! Take him!!! He is every student's dream.
5,He is best teacher that I've ever had!!! Take his class and you will love it!!
4.5,Mr. Annunobi was a funny teacher. His class was very easy. I got an A out of the class. I hardly study for his class. I never did my homework. The tests were fairly easy.
4,Dr Annunobi is a nice  funny teacher. His tests can be hard at times  but overall he is a great teacher. He's big on attendance  but if you show up for every single class and do the work  its easy to pass. Also  get on his good side  he wont fail you at all then.
4.5,HIS ACCENT DOESN'T REALLY BOTHER ME BECAUSE I KNOW I HAVE ONE TOO. MR ANNUNOBI LIKES THOSE THAT TALK IN AND ANSWER QUESTIONS. IF YOU ARE NOT A TALKING KIND OF PERSON  PLEASE DON'T TAKE HIM. GREAT TEACHER  HE KNOWS HIS STUFF. U GONNA PASS HIM ANYWAY.
1,He's a hard teacher becuase of his accent at times he's hard to understand ( he knows this already) but when he assings homework he rarely collects them  if you have patience and alot of time you might pass this class with a C but if you need a good GPA go to another campus and take this class
5,MR Anunobi thinks he knows everything.  which happen not to be true..his tests are so trickish... IF u know how to answer questions and talk in class.TAKE HIM.
1,Very Very unhelpful. He is the Political Science department head of Decatur campus  and when complaints are brought to him  he does nothing to help the students. He puts on a show infront of the class raising the expectations of the class he is going to do something but he never does a thing.

1,She did not put any grades in the system the ENTIRE semester. I couldn't see how I was doing until the final grade went in  and even then I couldn't see what I did wrong.
1,"It is almost finals week  we have TWO TESTS for grades and we had to go visit a museum on student study day (btw she cancelled the trip to the museum at 5 in the morning  and then told us to go anyway for a grade). no real office hours  just ""catch her"". There is no h.w YOU must PARTICIPATE in the class discussions. she uses the word stupid ALOT!!"
3,She's a nice  sweet teacher even though her lectures can be a tad boring. She's funny and tries to lighten up the class if none of the students participates. Her tests doesn't really match of what she lectures you just have to read the whole chapter to get the answers.
1,Hardest teacher ever.
1,She speaks softly and does not teach what is on her tests. One time we spent days on one chapter and there was one question on the test about it. She picks favorites with students and does not do well with questions. If you ask her a question it turns into a argument .
4.5,Good teacher. Grades fairly and gives many opportunities to students to do well. A little quirky but overall a good instructor. She likes lots of oral discussion and writing. Show up  participate in class and complete assignments. They will help on exams.
4,"Lecture-Lecture-Lecture it sounds boring but if you stay awake in class and read a few handouts you'll never need to open your book or STUDY!!! What you hear is what you get. So just sit there listen and get an ""A"". She likes participation and she's truly old school so show some respect and understanding for her style- and read your syllabus!!"
1,worse teachers ever  very confusing  she be all over the place  very hard to understand  if u into b.s'ing this the teacher for u....
1,i am not a fan of history so her teaching made it a little harder to like it. she takes 2 weeks to just get through 4 pages and we would have an exam in 1 week and barely covered the chapter. what she reviews does not match the test. when you take her class just read ahead of the class to past the tests. she is a nice lady but not a good teacher.
1,The worst teacher I've ever had  hands down. She doesnt start her lessons until 2 weeks into the semester  and she grades by how much she likes you. I made all A's and B's on the assignments/tests  and somehow I ended up with a C in the class -_- Don't expect to gain anything from this class. How does this woman have a job?
1.5,Awful. Never even stands to teach. Study guides don't match tests  removes information like the Mexican-American war but must know minor details like how Andrew Jackson shut down banks. Really disorganized  so boring. Better to just take online. Made a history lover like myself loathe history
1.5,BORING! All we do is read from the book. Study guides are provided  however notes and pages are very long and sometimes things appear on test that aren't on study guide. Very disorganized and very boring class. Also  if she doesn't like you  you will KNOW. She can be so harsh to kids leaving or late!
1.5,I was disappointed. She is very sweet  but the quality of her teaching leaves much to be desired. Her lectures were boring and monotonous  rife with historical and geographical errors  yet she was critical and condescending to the students for not being more interested. It's as though she's lost her motivation. She could do better. (I made an A.)
5,She is the sweetest kindest woman  and she really wants you to pass. She is the only teacher I know that provides you with STUDY GUIDES!!! She's awesome!!!
3,First off  this teacher is very sweet and you will pass the class if you show effort. she cares to help you and thats what i love about her! I got a B in her class! BUT i only recommend to take her if you dont mind reading out the book to study. she does not provide any notes for you to study and her lectures tend to be boring. good luck!
4.5,This teacher I must say was confusing. The studyguide had question that wasn't on the test. She loves her job but she's always off topic. Overall i would rate her average cause she will help you pass if you show effort.
5,Great class  great lectures. If you follow the notes she gives  read the pages she tells you to read and listen and participate in class you can't fail. Show no interest  be disrespectful in any way and you will pay. You have to totally not care to fail this class.
2,I got an A in this class but it wasn't easy. This is coming from a student that is usually tolerant of bad teachers  but PLEASE DON'T TAKE HER...history should not have been this hard. She's always late...disorganized and somewhat confusing. Very sweet lady  but just do yourself and choose a different professor.
2.5,Let me just say she's nice but if you took her you're better off taking the class online. She often goes off subject  she can't keep a straight thought. Tests are 25 questions over 3 chapters and you're not sure what will be on the test. The paper was easy. Just make sure you read. Her slideshows are useless  she doesn't know how to work them.
3,IF YOU: SLEEP IN CLASS  DONT PARTICIPATE IN CLASS DISCUSSIONS DONT LIKE TO READ AND LIKE TO LEAVE EARLY..PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DONT TAKE HER CLASS! BUT SHE IS GREAT!
5,I like her. She made everybody felt free in her class. Recommend everybody to take her. I took her three semester ago and i'm not sure if she's still teaching.
4,I like her and the class. That's a best sociology class and easy to get A+.
4.5,nice  funny  good
5,Gale Jones-Hardimon is the best teacher I have ever had. She is fun and makes sociology interesting. She gives you the desire to learn. Group tests that she gives the answers to in advance.
4.5,She is a wonderful and interesting teacher. She is pretty fast paced with the reading  but her class is all based on group work  even you final is taken with your group.
5,"She is very easy!! She creates a strees free environment for her students. She does a alot of group activites that ae easy. For example group tests  final  and presentation. YOu will leasrn alot from her class and be able to get an ""A"""
2,Dr. Bosworth is a very kind  brilliant man. The definitions killed on the quizzes and final  but he does grade very generously. My advice is to go over previous class assignments  and dedicate a couple hours a week to go over the notes and really memorize the material.
1,I'm sorry but Bosworth is a horrible teacher. This is my second time taking Computer Organization  and again the whole class is failing. Do not buy the book because he teaches directly from his slides. His tests are unorganized and he hates answering questions. Try to find another study buddy that can help you because he really wont offer much help
1,He's an awful teacher. Everyone I know is failing his class. His lectures are not only brutally boring  but useless as well. He created a study guide that was absolutely useless and the majority of the class failed the test.
3.5,I took this class during the summer and hardly attended class. The class was very boring but all assignments were online. I didn't really learn anything  but he's really sweet.
2,Unfortunately  you have to take this class for this major...so sorry! I was lost the whole time.
1,This is the worst teacher i have ever had. he does not explain anything  and he does not even care about the stuff he teaches himself. try to avoid him  but if you must take him  expect to be bored out of your ever liveing mind.
1,Dear god  this class is horrible. So sorry you all have to take it as CPSC majors. Tests have random things that he may or may not discuss on them  you only have 5 grading opportunities. Lectures are boring and too fast paced to take notes. Isn't helpful at all if you have a problem. Read his study notes  don't even buy the book.
1,I am miserable! He doesn't have any idea about what is going on  so we definitely don't. He has worn the same outfit every class. He will bore you and confuse you. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!! P.S. Everybody faied the midterm.
1.5,BOARING! He never really answered any questions I had  just do the online assignments on time  if people stop showing up he starts giving random quizes to take attenance. Tests are toatlly off topic and not in the format he says they are. No study guide shouldnt be a problem class if your in college you already know how to use the software anyways
2.5,Most boring professor I have ever had. He complains too much. His voice is extremely monotone. I never knew when assignments were due. If you pay attention (which is extremely hard) you'll do well on the quizzes/tests. I had to force myself to go to class. Do not recommend.
1.5,Never graded homework  midterm took a month to get back. Most of the questions for the final did not come from his notes  lectures or the textbook  took hours of online research for each question. Highly recommend.
1,If you want a clear teacher go somewhere else the first thing he asks people in the class is if they have a learning disability  not taking credit for his lack of a teaching ability or vagueness on what we are going to do  I never had a class that basically is guess what the test will be on no examples whatsoever  but if all the class fails oh well
2.5,He gets bored with his own lectures and dismisses class early. You only need the access code really  no point in buying the book since you can get the code separately. He tries to tell jokes  I don't think he realizes we're laughing at him not with him  but whatever. Overall easy class to pass  worth putting up with Bosworth's strangeness.
2.5,He is a very boring professor in the way that he teaches. He thinks he is very funny  while at times  he very well may be. Made us by our coursebook and we did not use it one time
4.5,Dr. Bosworth is a great professor and a friendly person. He is helpful and will make time for anyone if you have questions. He knows his stuff  which is always a plus. He is fair teacher who can sometimes get off-topic  but he keeps you on your toes and often has very interesting stories to tell. I would highly recommend him.
3.5,I have had Dr. Bosworth for 3 classes now. This professor has a great personality and really enjoys interacting with the students. His website is full of useful material to help ace test. overall  assignments are easy  but do require effort.
1,No Comments
4.5,Dr. Bosworth cares about his students. He has a good sense of humor. He goes over everything that appears on a test. You must apply yourself by at least reading his notes and looking at old homework and tests posted on his website.
3,As a person he was a nice guy  but he did not know how to present his material. He knew his stuff  but he didnt know how to present it to the class. Other than that he is very funny. Good advice!! He has alot of his answers on his homework and exams on his website. So go there and print it off.
2,Grading can be a little tough. He never shows you how to do the same thing the same way two times in a row which can lead to some confusion. Writes things on the board that aren't testable Looses you as you try to decipher what he's written down.
4.5,Thought I wasn't going to pass but if you ask questions about the papers assigned to you  go to class  do well on the quizzes and papers then you'll be fine.
5,I enjoyed his teaching
4.5,I thought this would be a scary course  but he made it really clear.
3,dude is huge and i mean huge and is a rude guy but he knows alot about politics
5,I learned a lot about foreign countries.
5,I didn't think this would be an exciting course  but I learned a lot. He's not an easy grader  but you learn in his class. I'd take him again.
5,He really knows a lot about political theory. I thought this was going to be a BOOOOOOOOOOOORING course  but he's made it really interesting.
5,I think he's forgotten more than I'll ever learn in political theory. Where does he get his memory?
3,Very knpowledgeable of politcal science  a very fast speaker  laughs at his own jokes even if no one else gets it.
5,I think he knows too much. You have to work hard for him.
4,a lot of work  but very good. take him!
4.5,Brilliant teacher. Will make you either love political science or appreciate it more than before.

5,A bright  engaging teacher.
4,I would highly recommend taking Dr. Carnes and getting on her good side! She favorites students but if you participate in class and make an effort you'll do fine. Tests aren't hard. Make sure you study the study guide and you will be fine. Her personality makes class enjoyable and a fun learning environment!
1,Avoid this teacher! Even though her syllabus says no quizzes/pop quizzes she does them and puts them down as assignments on Blackboard. If your on her good side you might pass  but if you are on her bad side you might have to drop the class. Being late or unable to attend class isn't an option. Lots of reading  never satisfied with your work.
2.5,Overall the best I can say is I don't hate Dr. Carnes. She liked me which is a good thing because her grading choices are incfluenced by her opinion. She's also the current department chair so it is essential to get into her good favor.
3.5,I really enjoyed Dr. Carnes class. The class discussions were always interesting  it was my favorite class of the semester. Tests are easy  do the study guide and you'll pass. I always made flashcards. You have to do a few article summaries as well as a end of the term project. Don't procrastinate  and sign up for the middle/end of the semester.
5,Great Professor. Class is really discussion based so if that is not your cup of tea don't take her. If you go to her office she will give you help with anything. Also  study guides are exactly like the test  do them and you will at least get a B on the test!
5,Very nice professor. Won't learn a lot in the classes  almost all information from the book. Extremely organized. Loved her!
2.5,Tests are tough
2.5,Stay as far away as possible. If you're on her good side  it's fine  but if she doesn't like you  it's better to withdraw early. She lets her feelings about students she doesn't like influence her grading! Also  her instructions for papers are extremely vague  and if you miss some small requirement she will penalize heavily.
1,I took this class because it was suposed to be a fun class  and you would learn alot about international business. Dr. Carnes made it not fun. All you do in that class is read the text books  and talk about it. She will put you down if you get the answer wrong. Her tests are hard. I was very disapointed with the class.
2,Lana Carnes is rude and is now over the marketing department. If you have any problems with your teachers  go straight to the dean and bypass her. She is unhelpful and judgemental. She will also take the side of her teachers even if you provide evidence of grade discrimination.
3,I thought Dr. Carnes' class was okay  although I would not take her again. The assignments appear easy at first  but then you're surprised when you get a bad grade. NO FEEDBACK whatsoever given - no comments on papers or grades given/posted on Blackboard. Plays favorites and expects attendance EVERY class. Absolutely no slack given!!
3.5,"Dr. Carnes cct 201 class is hard  THAT is all that can be said. I am an A and B student and It was really tough to pull out a ""b"". By talking to her  you would think she built the entire college with her bare hands. She also bad mouths other professors in the college of business  which I thought was terrible to do in the classroom. Do NOT take her!"
2.5,Dr. Carnes was scary at first but I grew to like the class. Until the day she started kicking people out of the classroom. I missed one day and she got extremely upset. You definitely have to attend every single day  and be prepared to take grammar quizzes everyday as well. Not a piece of cake class that it should be.
5,Dr. Carnes seemed a little scary at first but I learned to like her and she worked her way into becoming one of my favorite teachers at EKU! Her short report helps set the stage for the field report and both are pretty simple if you follow directions. I was able to achieve a 95% on the field report. Presentations weren't bad  just nerve-wracking.
5,I took Dr. Carnes for orientation and it was easy. She made us go to campus events but it just helped us realize what all went on at EKU. She made me excited to take more business classes in the next 3 years.
2,Dr. Carnes was not my favorite. She expected waay too much work for a 1 hr class. She is not very helpful  avoid taking her at all costs.
4,Not a bad class. The field report took a LOT of time  but the in class assignments helped prepare for it. Each exam covers half the semester. Do the assignments well and turn in on time and you should be gravy. Also the group presentation is a little nerve racking  but not horrible.
4,Good Teacher  you learn lots of info in class but she grades to hard on little****!
3.5,I took her for orientation  which she'd never taught before. We had a ton of attendance/paper requirements at campus events  and I had to miss another class for one. Also  she only teaches to business students  she doesn't really worry about anyone else  so if you aren't a business major  it kinda sucks.
4,Class is not too hard  but Carnes expects you to do the work and be prepared for class  no excuses!
5,Dr. Gibrill is so down to earth. He funny and very smart! Always glad to help! Plus he's British  which is always cool in my opinion.
5,Awesome professor. was extremely knowledgeable about the subject and made it crystal clear ans more importantly relevant.
5,I had to do a lot of work  but it paid off.
5,He is knowledgable  patient  and funny. Take this class!!!!!!!!
5,One word: COOL!!!
5,He's great!
2.5,I missed no more then 3 classes but I missed no assignments. I finished with an A... She has you do tedious work like an essay every week. But it's a fairly easy class
5,Great Professor
5,I enjoyed taking her class. She made everything clear and was very helpful.
5,She makes American government seem very clear.
5,No Comments
3,I passed all the test with As n Bs  gave a very good presentation she loved  answered the questions in class discussions that no one else knew the answer to
3.5,she a good teacher she just talk funny. but overall her methods are effective. She can make it a bit more challenging though
3.5,No Comments
5,I really learned American government.
4.5,Very helpful. In order to succeed in her class you must read the material thoroughly in order to actively participate in class and do well on tests. If you don't have a penchant for reading long chapters and being detail oriented all the time you might not do well in her class.
2,She is hard to understand due to accent. Why is an African teaching American government?
3,No Comments
5,She's a wonderful teacher.
5,This is the easiest class an ME major will take and Dr. Todd makes it a lot of fun. You really have to try to not get an A+.
4,I'm pretty sure you're given an A+ just for registering. This class requires no effort what's so ever but then again I didn't realky learn much. Easy A
5,Super helpful. I have never worked on a lawnmower before but she was very understanding in the lawnmower lab and was quick to answer any questions we had. Go to class. It's not hard and it's an easy A if you just show up. Lectures were usually really short
3.5,Dr. Todd is very helpful and nice. ME 121 is a very easy class  so easy that basically if you show up to class  then you will pass. There are in class assignments everyday so it is important to show up. The only work really outside of class is the 10 minute homeworks on Blackboard  and the two professional society meetings for credit.
5,For this class your homework consists of writing a paragraph about some type of engineering based topic. If you show up you are pretty much guaranteed to pass. The hardest part of this course is attending two Engineering Society meetings  which is a no-brainer. You also get to take apart a lawnmower  nothings more fun than that.
3,Easy class. Material is interesting and easy. TA's were very helpful and friendly. Dr. Todd was MEAN though. Asked a question outside of class and she was very condescending and rude. Very discouraging since I had always heard great reviews of her.
4.5,She's very nice and friendly. Class is easy  mostly participation. First few classes are in a classroom. The rest are in a lab. For lab we get in groups and assemble and disassemble a lawnmower including the engine and describe the parts. I didn't know anything about engines beforehand so I was a bit lost  but after I looked it up online  I got it.
4.5,Very nice person and good professor! Extremely helpful both inside the classroom and as a counselor  and she made ME 120 very interesting and fun and a great representation of ME. We took a lawn mower completely apart and put it back together as our semester project  explaining how it worked along the way. She's great  take her if you can!
5,Great teacher! Very understanding and goes out of her way to help you! take her!
5,Great teacher! She is very understandable. Love the class...so many cute guys...anyways she helps you out whenever you need it...you get to work with partners taking some of the weight off your shoulders...highly recommended teacher
4,She's really easy and gives tons of extra credit throughout the semester. Her projects are fun and entertaining. She's a little arrogant but who isnt. She has a slightly nasal voice but easy enough to understand. Her slightly difficult but with a little work they can be aced.
5,This class was extremely easy. If you do the work this class should be an automatic A. In addition  Dr. Todd is great about letting you know about scholarships and other opportunities. Definitely stay on her good side.
4.5,Easy teacher  but sometimes slow in getting grades back to you.
5,Having our text books seemed pointless after awhile  but our projects and classwork was always easy and interesting. An easy A and an awesome teacher! I love Dr. Todd!
3,After the first few weeks  there really wasn't any point in having the book.
4,Good teacher. Easy grader.
4,Michael is an amazing prof. He definitely picks favourites and his acting class if physically challenging but  if you take the work seriously  he will respect you for it. Overall  a fantastic theatre teacher.
5,One of the better profs at acadia ...
4,I am a feminist
5,No Comments
3.5,While Devine is indeed engaging and knowledgeable  he also plays blatant favorites  and strives to have students like him [and want in his trousers]. He dumbs down material to appeal to everyone  to the point where bad students are glorified and good students learn nothing. Also vaguley sadistic.
2.5,He is a great professor if you are one of his favourites. He will also dumb down his classes until they are all discussions that do not require reading the text book. The classes end up being a waste of time. I would choose not to attend  but it is mandatory.
5,Great prof who CAN be an ass  but is good none the less. I really enjoy my time working with him.
5,No Comments
4.5,He's an amazing prof. He's supportive and helpful. He's extremely challenging but he does it in a way that you actually want to work hard and make him proud of you. Excellent guy.
5,Best teacher I have ever had. Scary at first but then you get used to him and he's great. Understanding if you go and talk to him as well  but isn't a pushover. I recommend his class  as it's the only class that i've ever found interesting enough to go to
4.5,such an amazing prof! this class is most definatly my favourite. he really has a way of putting his students at ease from day one. classes are challenging  but in a really amazing and fun way. and wriggling like a cod is always a blast... haha
4.5,No Comments
2,I had been taking notes in lecture and out of the book  studied prior to the midterm and the questions were nothing like I had expected. Luckily  the group project and final bumped my grade. She let the class vote on the final  we chose an essay. She told us the prompt beforehand. Felt that my grade did not reflect my effort or knowledge of subject
2.5,It's an interesting class for sure. It's basically forensic anthropology. But it's very difficult. You have to write two 10 page papers and there are three testsquizzes that are only 10 questions long  and very detail oriented and difficult. You must study for these. Also  come to class  because you get a grade for showing up and that helps.
4,I liked her. Long lectures  but posted the class notes to eLearning. Lots of subject related movie day classes. Two 5-page independent papers  & one 10-page group paper  which I did alone (1 member dropped class  other didn't do ANY work  so Dr. Salter told me to do it on my own!). 1st test hard  2nd is essay written in class (given ? in advance).
2.5,There is a huge group paper and lots of long lectures. There were plenty of (class related) movie days. The real problem I had with the class was the actual grading. It didn't seem standard at all  more like it depended on what mood she was in. This is kind of teacher to not round up your grade. You've been warned.
3.5,She is very passionate about what she teaches  which is admirable. Rarely gets through the entire lectures but is nice enough to post all of them online. The papers and tests are really hard but she grades the papers easily. The class is definitely not a blow off but it is not impossible to get an A. You also watch a ton of movies.
5,Attendance is mandatory  there is a sign in sheet at the beginning of class so don't be too late. Kinda boring  alot of pp slides. Quizzes are not bad  just study all the slides bc you don't know what she's gonna ask. Papers weren't too bad  follow rubric and you will do well! Movies are interesting at the end of the semester. Read great books too!
3,This class was pretty boring  and that's hard to do because it was a subject i found very interesting. some days were more interesting  but overall it got pretty mind numbing. at least 50 slides of notes most days  tons of writing... the 10 page paper was hard. not just long  but nothing to write about. i didn't love or hate this class
5,Just be sure to pay attention and actually study for the tests & the class will be pretty easy. Don't fret over the 10 page essays because you'll get a good grade as long as you include all that she asks for in the rubric. Nothing too difficult. She's a great professor  knowledgeable  very nice  & pretty funny.
4,she is a really nice professor and most lectures are pretty intersting. i took female biology and bones bodies and disease. for BBD she tells you to read an emily craig book but its awaste of time there is only one question in the test about it and i got it wrong any ways. you have to write 2 ten page papers
4,Tests were easy for someone with science background and study slides. Hard if you do not pay attention. Stickler on class etiquette. You will get a good grade on the papers if you include everything she requires (she gives you a rubic). Wants to be able to read the paper without trying to figure out what you are trying to say.
1.5,If this was not my last semester  I would have dropped this class from day 1. Awful - lectures are dull  slides are a mess  tests do not match what she says to study for  uses obscure things from the book never addressed during class. If you can get around taking this class and this professor  do so.
5,She is a very nice professor as long as you have good classroom etiquette. A lot of information is covered
2.5,This is the only class that I have ever dropped.
4.5,Class was interesting and she knew a lot about the subject. The was very upbeat and tried to get the class to participate. The papers were not hard and she gives you a rubric and went over the reqirements in class plenty of times. I never had a hard time finding her in her office. Definitely not a blow off class so slackers beware!
2,"Took this class during a 5 week session because my advisor said it would be ""easy"". However  there is a test everyday TWO 10 page papers due on two novels-due a week apart from eachother. Her tests are almost impossible to get an A on because it's all memorization of very presice facts. Wouldn't recommend taking her in reg. semester either!"
1.5,This class has probably been one of the worst I have taken since coming to UTD. Unless you REALLY like lectures that will put you to sleep and primates...stay away!!! She grades very hard and the lectures seemed very disorganized and unrelated to required readings.
4,I took Human Female and BBD. It was somewhat interesting and the information would probably be helpful to most. There were three ten page research papers due in HF and 2 in BBD
2.5,Her actual class was not bad we had interesting converstaions  and lectures were interesting. Attendance is 10% of your grade  so if you plan on attending class thats a plus. You have 3 TEN page papers in this class  the rubric is not great  she is impossible to get a hold of  and if you do poorly she gives almost no feed back or reasoning.
2,If you want to turn in a 3 page paper every week then take her class. Her grading is very hard. Lectures were so boring so plan on getting a lap top to pass time. She never looks at the students when she lectures just at the ceiling or at the wall behind us. Don't take her if you have a choice.
4,Excellent class. Good information for everyone to know. The first class is hard  but then the second half is easy with only two papers and she grades them easy as well. So don't let failing your two tests lead u to drop the class  because an A or B is attainable as long as you do the two papers.
5,Dr. Baker really cares about his students. The homework in this class was optional and there were 8 tests and that may seem daunting but the tests were not difficult at all if you looked at the material and/or did the homework. This class could have been very hard but Dr. B went out of his way to make it easier for us while we still learned a lot.
5,This class is more of an informative class for your future in the aerospace program while learning about basic fundamentals. Dr. Baker cares a lot about everyone in the department and tries to assure everyone is set up for success in this class and in their future in the AEM curriculum.
5,Dr. Baker is a great professor. AEM 121 was super easy compared to what I've heard about the other engineering intro courses.
3,Dr. Baker is a nice person. I did not like this class however due to being graded by few things. Some of which these things were out of the student's control. For instance  the egg drop or glider project either worked or it didn't work and your grade depended on it. We didn't know our egg was going to break and our grade suffered. No tests.
5,Amazing class. Entertaining and knowledgeable  plus he's more than willing to accommodate changes in schedule. Show up and you'll have to try to fail
5,Great guy  great class. Incredibly nice and willing to work with students. Show up for 121 and you're practically guaranteed to pass
5,Great guy. Great Class. The schedule said this class met 3 times a week but he made it to only twice a week. Baker made class enjoyable even though it was a 9am. Definitely an easy A.
5,Dr. Baker is very helpful and intelligent and definitely one of the best professors I've ever had.
4,Great teacher. He cares so much about his students. You can tell he has a true passion for Aerospace and Mechanics. The tests are extremely easy
5,Dr. Baker is by far the best instructor that I have ever had. He is very friendly  and he legitimately cares for his students. He helped us with the transition into the AEM program  and he is absolutely amazing. The midterm and final are both 20Q multiple choice  which take 10 minutes each. Attendance is 60% of your grade  so show up for class!
5,Dr. Baker is one of the best professors at Alabama. The class is extremely easy and more for getting you transitioned into the Aerospace program. Dr. Baker is always available to help  and genuinely cares about you.
5,Dr. Baker is there to inspire you. He teaches you about introductory Aerospace Engineering  but what he really wants to do is to inspire you to succeed in life. He really does this well  and he enjoys what he does. He's always willing to help even with his busy schedule as department head. Attendance is 60% of the class so if you show up  you pass.
5,Excellent.
5,Hands down one of the best professors I have ever had. Has a true passion for teaching and explains everything very well so that anybody could understand the material. Very willing to help you with anything/ class even if he does not teach it. I wish all professors could teach as well as him.
5,Definitely one of the best teachers at the University. He is extremely helpful and an all around great guy. He actually knows what he is talking about.
5,Dr. Baker is one of the best teachers I have had. He seems interested in what he is teaching and makes it interesting to learn. He is one of the best at leading and encouraging participation in class discussions.I don't think it would be possible to take a class with him without learning something and enjoying learning it.
4.5,The guy to take for either one of the thermo classes. easy to understand. very helpful outside class. my favorite professo at UA so far.
3,Easy to understand!
4.5,Made the class more reasonable than I expected it to be. notes got repetative from the middle of the semester on  so you actually have to pay attention to pick out what's new. always willing to help
5,Turned out to be an easy class. I took it because I had to  not because I wanted to. Very helpful teacher and very easy to learn from.
5,Good prof and a funny guy. His lectures can run a bit long  but his sense of humor and tangents keeps them interesting. 99% of what you do in class translates exactly to the tests. He also makes accommodations for the way the online HW works  so getting the grade there isn't too hard. Just makes sure you don't underestimate his tests and do well.
4,Midkiff is a really nice guy and doesn't make the class unnecessarily hard. He goes off on tangents sometimes but they are related to the material and he has cool stories to tell. Make sure you study the lecture notes and examples for the tests.
5,Great teacher doesnt make the class a living hell and the tests are very fair
3,He's a great guy but its hard to learn thermo from him. Goes off on too many tangents. Figured out after the 1st test that I could not go to class and still make the same grades. Im sure going to class would've helped a little more but you're just as fine studying old tests. You get a note sheet every test. 4 tests with lowest dropped and a final.
4,He is the head of ME department. He has been teaching thermo for years. His lectures can be dull and put you to sleep. He goes off topic a lot with his stories. Homework is not due till end of semester but keep up to do well on tests. The redeeming value is his tests are easy and curves very generously.
4,"Good guy  just kind of has dull lectures. Worth going to class though  when attendance drops he will announce a pop quiz. Your question will usually be ""Please recall your name""  and you turn in your name. Very lenient with homework as well."
2,"Rambles a lot. He takes up half of the class going on his ""Midkiff diversions."" We're paying money to get an education  not listen to stories. His in-class examples are nothing like the test questions and the homework problems are unnecessarily hard. If you get above a 60  he counts them as a 100 because ""the program messes up."" The book sucks too."
4,I loved Midkiff as a person  he was hilarious and told awesome stories a lot  but sometimes his lectures were boring or there were things on the exams that we didn't ever go over. All of the homework is due at the end of the semester  but keep up with it because it helps on the exams. Most of the homework was way harder than the exams though.
5,Pretty easy class. A lot of the math-based problems are just plug and chug. Be careful with the conceptual stuff. Look at the notes he puts online  pay attention in class  do the homework  and you'll be just fine
5,Dr. Midkiff is one of the most liked and respected professors in the ME department. He regularly assigns homework dealing directly with the material that will be on the test and devotes almost the entire class to working example problems so that you can actually figure them out on your own. His lectures are useful and he has a good sense of humor.
3.5,"Dr. Midkiff is a really knowledgeable  and helpful teacher. He is always available for help and responds quickly to emails  usually copying the whole class so that no one is confused. He gives a few attendance ""quizzes"" if he starts to see a decrease in attendance. Overall  very respected and really knows his stuff. Would definitely recommend."
5,Dr. Midkiff is a phenomenal teacher and a really nice person. Considering how difficult thermodynamics is  he makes it very understandable. He includes tons of practical application examples in his lectures that make them engaging. Great sense of humor too. I highly suggest him for any thermo course at this school.
5,His hands-on experience in industry helps him to be able to explain course topics in a way which is easy to understand.
5,Midkiff is awesome! He is very easy to understand and he puts all his notes online. He is also easy to talk to and very understanding if you need help.
5,Dr. Midkiff is the man. All notes are posted online  he is very helpful  and his exams are more than fair. A lot of homework though.
4,Very reasonable professor. He made the class enjoyable. Would find a way to relate material to real world application.
3.5,very knowledgeable. hw from the textbook doesnt really help with preparing for tests. getting the solutions manual will really help (several of our problems couldnt be solved or had errors in the solution). he made a lot of mistakes working problems in class which made it easy to get confused. his multiple choice are pretty tough. Overall great guy
4.5,Test were straight forward. Go to class  do the homework and you will do well. Also  class notes were posted online.
4,Very nice guy  gave a whole sheet of paper front and back for use on test  gave 7 tests which was good and bad. The class made absolutely no sense but thats not the professors fault. Just use the peice of paper on the test and youll be fine maybe.
5,Great guy. Great class. Fun lectures and he e-mails all notes which is super helpful for tests. May give a super easy quizzes (Q: Who are we playing this weekend? A: Georgia.) for a homework grade  but if you're not there  you'll get a zero  so go to class. (Making one really good review sheet is clutch for the final.)
1,I tried liking him. I really did. I really wanted to. This class was awful. It was the same content as Mahmoodi's section  but he managed to drive it into the ground and not teach anything whatsoever. For the love of all that is well in the world do not take this man for dynamic systems. Mahmoodi will not actively try to ruin your life.
3,Professor Williams give fair tests but requires a lot out of his students. Computer assignments (mandatory grade of C+ or higher to pass) take very long to complete (10+ hours) and are only worth 10% of the final grade. Lectures can often be off topic and hard to follow as he moves fast. With preparation and studying this class can be an A however.
5,He is a great teacher and really know's the material! This class has the potential to be difficult but he did his best to make sure that everybody passes!! I look forward to taking him for future classes!!!
4.5,He is very nice and extremely helpful. He really wants to everyone to do well. Though he only worked problems in class  he spent much time after class explaining and going over questions. His class did require a lot of work. In the end  an overall enjoyable class.
5,Super nice guy! Class requires lots of work  but he makes it as easy on you as possible.
5,No Comments
5,Varries by the year. My semester almost everyone got A's  but he has been difficult in previous semesters. Very  very nice. Kinda reminds us of Dilbert.
4.5,He's extremely nice and follows the powerpoint well. He explains material fairly well and is extremely helpful when you are confused. He prepares you for the exams.
5,Great teacher. Examples in class were very similar to questions asked on tests. Has homework due every class  but not overly difficult. Come to class and do your homework and you should get an A.
5,"Dr. Parker is extremely reliable and he genuinely cares about his students and will put your priorities in front of his own. He referred to Excel as ""a stupid computer program"" just about every class  which surprisingly got more and more hilarious with time"
4,Class itself is easy  but when it came to actually taking the tests  I didn't feel like we were prepared enough for the questions asked. However  he is a really fair grader and will give you the benefit of the doubt  so if you're on the right track you'll get most of the points.
4.5,Dynamics can be hard  but J. Parker is definitely the guy to take. His test problems are so much better than Freeman's. He grades easy too. Do your hw and you will be fine.
3,extremely boring and condescending but class is not that hard
5,Dr. Parker is the guy to have for dynamics. He is a very good teacher and the tests aren't that hard. On the tests  if you are on the right track then he will give you most of the points. The only bad thing is the homework... you can expect new homework every class.
4,Tests aren't that hard but the lab reports are pretty rough. He's very fair. Grades are pretty good.
3,Homework due before every class  but it's only 3 questions. I would do the homework and not Chegg it because it'll help when you're preparing for the tests. Tests are similar to homework problems and the final was EXACTLY our homework problems.
1,Statics with Haque was very difficult. He did examples during class and assigned homework every night  even if we didn't finish the examples in class. Sometimes the homework and class notes seemed completely unrelated. Tests are 90% of your grade and he didn't curve.
4,Key points: 1. Mostly Vectors and Vector applications. 2. All tests were easy for anyone with a clear understanding of Cal 2. 3. Final was extremely hard. 4. Magical Curves? I went into the final needing to make a 100 to make a solid B. I did terrible on the final. Ended with an A-. 5. Great Teacher. 6. Short Homework due every lecture.
5,He's a little difficult to understand  but I took this class at 8am. He focused more on computation than conceptual questions  but does a great job at explaining both.
2,Not a great lecturer  just does a few examples with little context or general formulas. Tests are moderately difficult and he is very stingy with partial credit. No dropping grades or anything like that. Homework is very time consuming  and small errors hurt your grade. Would not recommend if you aren't very good at physics.
2,So Im still in his class right now but i wanted to write a review for people looking to take Haque. The beginning weeks of his class are very easy  but dont be fooled  the information picks up. I would say go to his classes but his accent is very thick so its not very worth it. If anything read the book!
3,Very smart man  not a very good communicator. Isn't very good with explaining or understanding your questions.
3,He's not bad  not especially good. If you're cool with physics mechanics  you got it. If not  it's not easy to get help. The first 9 weeks you can skip some classes  later you learn things. he checked attendance randomly 6 times over the semester.
5,Clear  straightforward  understandable. Teaches all necessary material well and prepares you for tests. Hand-written short homework daily  I would suggest doing them for practice. Gives a couple tests but they are short and fair and he tells you what type of problems will be on them. I would definitely recommend Dr Haque.
4,Very good professor and really consider students' request. Test not hard but needs detailed reviews.
3.5,Haque is an exceptional professor. His communication is shaky at times  but you'll get used to it. Test questions are very similar to the homework. He gives a couple good examples in lecture  but usually gets rushed toward the end of class. If you pay attention in class and do the homework it's not too bad.
4,Gives good examples. The test questions were either examples from the book or problems from the back of the book. Taught slightly different methods from what the book said. If you go to class  pay attention  and take good notes  it's easy to get a good grade.
3.5,Tests really covered what he lectured and homework assigned. Great instruction and very willing to help.
5,Great Professor. Teaches well  answers questions  easy going with his students. He's a nice guy and GREAT EXAMPLES.
4.5,Excellent teacher. Knows his subject.
2.5,He really wants all his students to do well  and as a result he often curves grades or gives bonus points. He is hard to understand at first  but if you sit near the front and pay attention you get used to him.
4,I like this guy because he seems to be helpful and friendly. He doesn't try to act too smart like all the other egocentric proffesors. Seems to value your overall experience. He gave us a take home final.
3,Not the best in lecture. Be sure to pay attention during his review classes before exams as they always give the exact problem types that will be on exams. Typically curves the overall grade at the end of the semester as most students do poorly.
1,Do not take Sharif for Dynamics  or anything for that matter. He stands up at the front working examples  with horrible handwriting  and speaks incomprehensibly. To make it worse  he uses online tests and quizzes with ridiculously low tolerances  and made us write down work but didn't give partial credit for it  would just TAKE OFF points...
1,I didn't listen when I was told not to take Sharif for Dynamics  and I wish I hadn't taken his class. The material isn't difficult  but he only uses online grading and it makes it really hard to do well in the class even if you understand the material. He also has a really thick accent and bad handwriting  lectures are difficult to understand.
1,The class consists of him standing at the front working out examples. He never explains what he is doing or why  and it is super confusing. Combine this with a large lecture hall  his horrible handwriting  & thick accent and the lecture is incomprehensible. The grade you receive is based on 10 online pop quizzes & online test during lecture period.
2,His lectures are not very helpful with his poor handwriting and angry demeanor. He was not very helpful during office hours. He posts online notes that are typed and easier to follow along. He does offer good review before each tests to give an idea of what will be on tests. Lots of homework but only worth 5% of grade.
1,"Professor Sharif is unintelligible. His accent is atrocious  and he speaks as though he has a mouth full of marbles  and his handwriting is somehow worse. He writes both his ""v's and r's"" as you would a gamma  which come up a lot in dynamics. He isn't capable of doing his own problems in class  and made the 2nd test the day after the drop date."
4,Professor Sharif teaches fluids in a very straightforward way. He holds review sessions before exams that are very similar to the exam itself. Homework is due every class but is only worth 5% of the final grade so doesn't hurt too much if you forget a few assignments. If you study the review and homework problems before the tests you should be fine
1,I cannot understand what he is saying. His notes are very messy and his handwriting is horrible. His tests are similar to the homework but he is not good at explaining anything. I had him for Fluids and Dynamics and both times were MISERABLE. Do NOT take him for anything!!!!!!!!!
2,Dr. Sharif comes to class with problems to work out. These problems are almost identical to the online homework. However  he often makes mistakes/gets confused with his own work. This can make the class confusing. His tests are very similar to the homework. Make sure you actually know how to do the homework and not just copy it from your notes.
2,DO NOT TAKE FOR DYNAMICS
3,Don't take him if you plan on taking Dynamics. He is supposed to be pretty good with Fluid Mechanics  but he wasn't very comfortable teaching Dynamics.
2,His accent is difficult to understand and it's not helped by his incredible messy handwriting. You'll have to teach yourself the material out of the book. He's also very condescending to anyone who asks a question. He gives a lot of homework  but it's not too tricky. His tests are almost always just like his review questions  which is nice.
2,I find Dr. Sharif very difficult to understand. His accent is thick  his handwriting is messy  and his lecture notes are unorganizated. He's a lecturer that works examples without telling you what your solving for  what topic you're on  etc. He also wastes a lot of class time waiting for the class to participate when no one knows the answer.
1,Professor Sharif is not the professor to take dynamics with. We spend class going over future homework examples. While this may seem nice  our homework did not relate to the first exam. Also  when a student asks him a question in class he simply repeats what he has said before which is not helpful. I would not recommend him for dynamics.
4,Sharif was a great choice for fluids. He was very clear in grading criteria  explained things very well  and kept the class moving at a good pace. I took the class during the second summer term  but even though the class only lasted about a month  the work required to do well in the class was very manageable. I would recommend taking Sharif.
3,The accent is the worst part  he's very hard to understand. But the class overall is easy to pass with little effort. Attendance isn't mandatory but homework is due every class. He reviews the class before the test and it's a great indication of what to expect on the tests. His tests are multiple choice and easy to do well on. Textbook used for HW
3,Not a great teacher and the accent doesn't help  but lets you know what to expect on exams and the final. He's the one to take for fluids. Attendance isn't mandatory  but you have to go in order to turn in HW (5% of your grade) that's due every lecture.
5,Just a great  great guy. Makes an impossible class extremely bearable and not too difficult  all whilst making sure you learn the basic concepts of fluid mechanics. Hilarious  helpful  and just a great professor all around
5,I enjoyed Sharif as he was great at communicating. Explains hard conceptsproofs for those who are more interested but doesn't require too much on tests. I highly recommend going to lecture and taking good notes and trying out the hw. HW is good practice for tests but is small part of grade. Gives good reviews for tests and allows formula sheets
4,I loved this class. Dr. Sharif has an accent which takes a few days to get used to but he has an amazing teaching style. The majority of lecture is him working out problems by hand. Before each test he does a review of 3 questions which are EXTREMELY similar to the actual test questions. He gives tons of partial credit and always wants to help.
5,McHugh is the best professor I have had at Merrimack. She is very passionate and respects everyone's view. Had her twice and wish I could take her class again.
4,She's a really great professor. Her lectures are fun and she really wants to hear her students opinions in class. Gives very minimum hw and is easy to maintain your grade if you just do what she gives you. She's so active around campus and will be more than willing to help you in whatever you need.
5,SHE IS THE BEST TEACHER ON CAMPUS! Take as many of her classes as you can. She really listens to the students and gives you a ton of chances to get extra credit
4.5,She is very nice.
4.5,She is very nice and helpful  but I feel like the material that she covers is very repetative and elementary
5,Definately take a class that she teaches. She's extremely nice and funny and she makes class interesting.
5,Take a class with McHugh at Merrimack if at all possible. She makes the class interesting and is very clear. She is sooo nice and really wants everyone to succeed. Very highly recommended
5,Wonderful professor  I enjoyed the class immensely. Very clear on assignments  and her lectures were always interesting.
5,she is great! so funny  she tells jokes all the time. She is really into what she teachs and makes it as interesting as Congress can be. Real simulation at the end on the term is wicked fun.
3.5,Lots of work but she's very very nice!
5,There's some busy work but overall she's a great teacher- she really lets you know what she's looking for on tests & you don't really have to do much reading at ALL for the classes  as long as you have pretty good attendance. She has a pretty good sense of humor too  which keeps it interesting. I'd definitely take another class with her!
5,TOTAL BABE!!! great teacher she is very clear and easy to understand. she has been known to be one hell of a softball player  and take people out at the knees. i have worked with her for several years now and have never had a better teacher. i love her dc
5,Washington...Jefferson...Adams....Lincoln....Adams
5,I love naming the top 5 presidents for her
3.5,Fair grader  good class  kind of dry though.

5,Macfarland combines mind and heart  he is very well read on many subjects. Although many people fail to understand his teaching style it works. He shows you had to think through scripture with intensity of the mind and with the felt of your heart. I know him well and consider him a friend.
5,all his classes were cool...yeah he is a little dry...but he is very passionate about christ & you see it through his teaching...stop hatin' youngstas
3.5,The lectures were hard to follow but he is a great guy and knows his stuff. Don' have to worry about getting the paper in on the due date  just get it in. He understands the meaning of GRACE. Thank you Jon!
5,take his class  just not too early in the morning. Good teacher and good content.
3,i fall asleep every time...but he is so nice and helpful..i just feel bad because that class is boring ..soo boring and its like fifty million people in the class...I hear his sermon on the mount is good..im taking it this term

5,Professor Hu lectures in an understanding matter
5,No exaggeration when I say Mr Hu is one of the best teachers I've had. Calc3 is not easy and it covers many topics  yet I was able to work the hw based almost entirely on what I learned in lecture. He's engaging  caring  hilarious  and approachable. He makes himself available outside of class and is responsive to email/phone. He is rooting for you
5,He will teach you outside the box and if you attend his class everyday and put some work  I guarantee you will be ready for your next math class.
5,Took Mr. Hu's summer school course. He was awesome! Explains everything in detail. He is well organized and goes over things that way you definitely absorb the information. I would take him again!
3,"He makes it clear on the first day what he expects from the class. He grades by how well you do compared to the class. He has a very thick accent and makes jokes about math majors and being from China. You will hear the word ""lousy"" and ""stupid"" everyday. He uses it to describe everything. He goes super fast and you need to study outside of class."
5,Has a very thick accent  but all his notes and examples he puts on the board are clear and straight forward. Very useful for Math 60. Daily lectures help tremendously with the HW. DO the HW to help pass the quiz the next day. Quizzes are daily. He will go over anything people have trouble with. Grades on a curve.
5,Great teacher in CCSF. He's very funny  and his logic is very clear. This teacher really get you ready for math 110B and math 110C.
5,Mr. Hu is a great professor and can be quite humorous! I took him for both Math 40 & 60. He takes attendance by use of daily quizzes and these will add up  so come to class! We did massive amounts of homework especially during the summer but it was always out of the book and not online :) ! His exams can be tough so prepare yourself by studying!
5,"Mr Hu would take time to explain the more subtle points of Calculus I. I was repeating this class for the third time with respectable grades previously. Mr Hu would make jokes about ""stupid math majors"". And the sci fi show Dr Who. Mr Hu had class study groups prior to tests/finals. I wish I had better study skills to retain learning I will review"
4,Mr. Hu is a very nice guy  but he's also one of the most difficult math professors I've ever had. I struggled to earn a C  but Hu is very well organized and you can learn a lot from his lectures. Not recommended for the faint of heart but if you identify as a math geek and like a challenge then this is the guy for you.
2,This dude moves super fast  has a thick accent  and has a grading scale which means its hard for you to improve your grade if you're not one of the smart people. Bad teacher  hard to understand. Lucky that I was decent enough at math to pass
1,If you are bad at math just do not take his class at all. He is a nice guy  tries to be funny and joke around. But as a professor he is just horrible. he cannot speak English properly  he knows math  just cant explain it. He does not like confrontation either  if you talk to him about something he will take it personal and make your life hell.
5,You will learn a lot from his class
4.5,Helpful helpful helpful! This is the guy you want if you are fearing math. I was dreading math but Hu tells you on Day 1 that he has study sessions. Saved my tail! It doesn't mean he's easy. It's college math: it's not supposed to be. But in the study sessions he works 1on1 with you til you get it. And he's very funny too! He makes class enjoyable.
3.5,This class was really difficult. I found a lot of his lectures hard to comprehend because he doesn't really go in depth with step by step  concise directions. He's a nice guy but I think this class is better suited for someone that already knows a bit about statistics or is generally very good at math.
5,One of the best math 80 teachers!! He assigns homework but it is similar to what will be on the test. He sets you up for success in his class. He may have a thick accent but he writes everything on the board so you have no reason not to understand. He made coming to class enjoyable with his sense of humor and funny personality!
5,Amazing teacher!!!!!!!!
5,I took Prof. Hu Summer '14. He is a great teacher. Very willing to help. Gives tons of examples during the lecture. He does have an accent  but you get used to it. Very kind and nice teacher. He gives tons of HW  but that's how you learn math anyway. Quizes everyday  Mon Wed Fri were group  Tue Thu were individual. On test you can bring small note.
5,I took Prof. Hu Summer '14. He is a great teacher. Very willing to help. Gives tons of examples during the lecture. He does have an accent  but you get used to it. Very kind and nice teacher. He gives tons of HW  but that's how you learn math anyway. Quizes everyday  Mon Wed Fri were group  Tue Thu were individual. On test you can bring cheat sheet
5,Fall 2013 night class.He speak Cantonese  Mandarin  English and post solutions online.His notes are organize.He don't check homework  but give you quiz(total value 30% final grade) from homework problems. you could use a formula paper in exam.Final exam is open book  notes  so print all solutions from his final review and at least read them once.
1,Class consists solely of student presentations - prof. does not teach material  provides only limited guidance of discussion. Expects a lot of prior knowledge of course material. Tests are very difficult. Papers graded with handwriting that is illegible so it is difficult to see what you did wrong and how to improve.
3,Head of history department. As with almost any elective at Bentley  he takes the classes too seriously and the tests are graded toughly. That being said he does give you the list of terms and essay topics for the midterm and final a week in advance  so that helps. Overall meh  wouldn't take again but a super nice guy who cares a lot.
4.5,I was not interested in history  however Professor Stern was a really great teacher and kept your attention  I will definitely take one of his classes again.
3,Nice guy but a tough teacher. All classes are straight lecture so be ready to take notes. For tests he gives you 40 terms and 5 essays  he picks a portion of them on test day. I had to work hard for a 3.3 and I have a solid background in APUSH. take it only if you're very serious. Even then  take with caution.
2.5,Definitely knows his stuff but has seriously high expectations for students. I like history (LSM Am. Studies) and worked really hard (went to office hours  did the readings) and simply couldn't get an A on anything. He was not helpful when I asked him how to improve on future assignments. Hard exams (2) and hard on papers(3)/pres (1). Don't take.
4.5,Knows a lot about history and admits that most of what he knows is useless knowledge. Read and outline the textbook and you'll be set for the exam. If you're interested in History take advantage of his strict grading and higher expectations of students  if you don't like History don't take his class.
3,3/30/09 said it well. You'll think you're failing the class the entire time
3,Pro:1.Knowledgeable about some aspects of US History 2.Makes lectures interesting 3.Usually friendly Con:1.Clearly liberal(I can't even tell if separating fact from opinion)2.Tough Class&High dependency on notes 3.LOTs of reading 4.Having background in history is nearly necessary 5.Disorganized manner  thought  speech and writing
2.5,Very intense history class. A lot of reading  and a huge amount of material on each exam. Only take if you love history
3,Stern is an amazing lecturer. He seems to know everything about U.S. history. You'll think you're failing his course the entire time  but if you try hard and do the work  you'll do fine. You end up learning A LOT because of the essay format of the exams (he gives a list of possible essays ahead of time). Great guy  but expects a lot from students.
5,The guy is very very smart  probably the smartest professor at the school when it comes to his subject matter.. Wants you to really engage and understand the subject  if your looking for an easy A like most people at Bentley instead of learn pick another teacher who will teach you nothing. you will look at the world differently after his course
1.5,Terrible teacher. I expected better from the head of the department  but every class he decides to display his knowledge about the topic and branch off to random topics. After all that he expects you to know what he meant to talk about. Also a mean guy in general. Very inconsiderate when a student was very sick and needed to switch final time.
4.5,Grades kinda hard  but if you put in the work you can do well. Very nice guy  but I might consider other professors for a history class.
1.5,It was horrible. he is such a hard grader. and he won't help you if you need him. try not to take this class.
1.5,This class started off pretty well  he seemed funny and at first seemed like he was going to be a great guy....wrong! I did everything I could to stay awake and study and do well  but i still got an awful grade. My friend was the smartest in the class and only got a 2.7...so yea.
4,Boring class. Grades kind of hard  but if you put in the time you can do well in this class. He knows what he's doing and is always willing to help.
2,DONT TAKE THIS PROFRESSOR. HE JUST READS FROM THE POWERPOINT AND HIS TESTS ARE VERY HARD!!!!
2.5,this was so boring i could not help but fall asleep. this is not an easy class and you will need to memorize EVERYTHING.
1,This class was extremely boring. Even though he gives you everything that is on the midterm and final there is an insane amount of information to know. Most of the info terms you have to look up on-line because you were not able to find it in pages of notes and he will NOT HELP YOU AT ALL.
2.5,So boring and all he does is lecutre. Tests--Study FIFTY ID's  10 will be on  and you pick 5 (each expected to be a page in blue book). Essay--study SEVEN  3 will be on  you pick 1 (should be 3 pages)... If you guess Right  you'll be ok (aside from extreme hand pain)  but he holds you accountable for insane amount of info.
5,Catherine was hard but good. She knew her stuff and helped her students get jobs at good places. I think all ya'll dissing her are just mad because she gave you a bad grade.

5,ALWAYS very helpful. Her wealth of real-world experience makes her a far cry from your typical J-school prof. Her casual approach can be offputting when compared with the rest of the faculty but there's no doubt that this was a great class.
1,She is REALLY BADshe has no clue about radio!!KBIA and the school didn't want to pay for a good radio teacher so she was the only one that would work for the little money they pay. She SUCKS!
1,she is still learning  not good for the *best* journalism school
1,Paul was a nice guy  but he was a ridiculously hard grader. He had no grace with any grades. Over the top and should not be teaching. He is too smart to be teaching college kids. If you dont talk in class you dont get any participation points. I would NEVER take him again. Im telling you  SAVE YOUR SELF!!
1,nice guys AWFUL teacher. just writes unintelligible graphs on the board and expects you to know what he is talking about. didn't even use the book at all. only has tests and a 5% quiz and a 35% cumulative final. this guy is way too smart to teach people who aren't econ geniuses. would take a different professor.
5,I am an international student. Dr. Pecorino is the most responsible professor I met in UA. His class is easy to understand so that I rarely read textbook after class. The class and homework is much helpful for tests. He is a very kind person. I really appreciate for his help.
1,Definitely the hardest class I've taken at UA. He makes up his own versions of the textbook graphs with about 2 examples  on the hw and study guide. Then he changes the graphs on tests in every possible way  and be ready for him to take off points for your lines not being perfectly tangent and minor labeling errors. Would NOT recommend!
4,Pecorino's class is difficult and fast paced. Attendance/Participation and homework are for extra credit  but you won't pass if you don't go. He lectures the entire class and there are homework assignments every week. The tests are mostly from the study guides which are from the homework. Go to the review session and study and it's a manageable A.
4,Paul is weird but funny. His notes are everything-GO TO CLASS. Definitely do the homework & get an answer key as well as the review sessions (he basically gives you answers to the test). He is definitely a tough grader  but gives you everything you need to be successful. Also gives up to 5 extra credit points for hmk & participation.
4,Not a bad choice for EC 110. He has dry humor. I made an A- in his class and studied a day or two before the test. I'm not very smart either.
4,Great guy  a bit monotone though. I'd definitely recommend his class
1,Worst teacher at UA! We pay too much for him to be a professor here.
1,by far worst I've ever had. UA should fire him today. I am a straight A student who got my first C because he was such a bad professor.
4,Dr. Pecorino is incredibly smart - there's no denying that. However  often times he forgets that he is teaching college students. do the study guides and you'll be fine for the tests. Go to lecture and MAKE him explain. The final however was awful. I scored above a 90 on every test and barely got a 68 on the CUMULATIVE final (35% of your grade).
1,By far the worst teacher at UA. AVOID
1,"AVOID HIM NO MATTER WHAT. Doesn't care about his students in the slightest since he's a ""research professor""  will nickel and dime you on every test so much so that all semester I never received full credit on a single question  changes study guide questions to be nothing like test questions. HORRIBLE TEACHER ALL AROUND. don't even bother with xc.."
2,Dr. Pecorino is one of the most confusing professors I have ever taken. I have never had to put in more hours studying for a class then his. He will change every practice problem from the study guide on the test and confuse you to no end. Would definitely recommend taking any other Econ class.
1,Hardest undergrad class I've had in my ec major. Exams are really hard. Would probably be easier if he gave you the tools you need. Your studying tools are 1 to 2 examples of the question which he will change drastically. You need to memorize the textbook  his slides  his lectures and google all the info he doesn't give you if you want an A. Avoid.
1,Pecorino makes EC 430 the hardest class at UA. Do not take him for this course! Half of the class dropped before Halloween  and the other half mostly has Cs. My advisor said this is possibly hardest class at UA taught by one of the worst teachers here. DO NOT TAKE
1,Dr. Pecorino is one of the worst professors at UA. I am a straight A student  and I think he makes class as hard as he can. I do not recommend his EC 430 if you have another elective you can take.
5,Fantastic Professor. Easy to understand and always lets lecture out early. Never assigns homework or quizzes so all your grades come from tests. Such a great teacher that you're always prepared for the test.
4,There is a lot of extra credit and he is very fair in the grading criteria. He is super sweet. If you show up to every class  you get four points on your final average. Would take him again!
4.5,Dr. Pecorino is honestly a great professor. His lectures are somewhat boring  but it's economics. The grading system is incredibly fair and Dr. Pecorino offers VERY generous extra credit. If you show up to every class he will give you 4 points on your final grade. You can get an easy A by just showing up to class and studying for exams.
5,Best teacher ever. Made math understanding
5,She is so sweet and understanding!
3,very helpful just hard to understand sometimes. Good teacher just over explains things sometimes. Drops the worst test grade and some homework and quizzes.
1,No comments
4.5,I like this teacher. She really wants her students to understand the math.She is extremely helpful. I dislike math very much but she got me through it. I was very bored most of the time however  but that is not her fault just the math.
4.5,Mrs. Hampel is a great teacher! She definitely wants her students to do well in class. She works hard each class to teach you the material by going through practice problems. I recommend her 100%
5,I love Mrs. Hampel! She is very helpful and is willing to do anything for you! She goes through the problems step by step and gives you easy ways to solve them. She really wants all of her students to do well! I definitely recommend her!!
5,Prof. Hampel is a great teacher. She is fair  helpful  and knows her stuff. If you show effort  she will help you out as much as possible. Truly cares about students. I recommend!
5,Loved her! She's very passionate about her students and wants you to do good. She knows the material very well. I highly recommend her!
4.5,I didn't do well in the class  but this was a wonderful teacher. My grade was not a reflection on how well a teacher she is. Super nice  much better than the other math teachers. She knows her stuff. I hope I get to take her again!
4,Shes nice.
5,wonderful wom.an who wants to help everyone
5,She tries her best to help everyone pass the class while still comprehending everything needed.
5,Great teacher. She's willing to help you out.
1,She's seems like a caring lady but her teaching methods are awful. She doesn't except late work  even with a doctor's note  does not reply to emails  and is difficult to speak to. I constantly felt like I was being judged by her when I participated in class  because she is very opinionated. I have all As except this class. STAY AWAY.
1,Professor Lee rants in class about her life. When she does talk about the course reading  she summarizes it (sometimes inaccurately)  makes broad claims about it  and introduces irrelevant ideas. She expects students to agree with her. For grades  she tells students what her criteria is and says that she grades according to it  but doesnt do so.
1,Do not take any class this woman teaches. All she does constantly is rant and talk about her life. She makes students read a course reader she created and do outline off it  but she doesn't even cover them in class  or outright lies about the info. Sher grading for everything makes no sense  and what she wants from you isn't any better.
4,She opens your eyes to Asian American women issues  but make sure to do your outlines asap! There is few hw and barely any quizzes  so try to work hard on them. Midterm and final were essays  she's a tough grader but you just need to understand and write in her pov. Visit her during office hours and sit in different parts of the classroom  trust me
2,She sometimes lectures but she likes to rant about today's politics most of the time. Her rubric and instructions for getting an A during an Exam is very unclear since everyone in the class followed them and no one got anything above a B-. Coming from a Computer Science Student who gets A's and B's this is the first grade below B- that I'm getting.
2,Do Not take this professor. She is not specific on anything. She is NOT organized at all which causes you to be confused most of the time. She is a tough grader and only wants you to believe what she believes. Thanks to her bad organization skills  I now have four assignments due in one week as finals are approaching. Do Not take her.
3,Teacher was inconsistent about due dates  which is a struggle with such a difficult  essay heavy class. We had three big projects due in one day. A lot of group essays which suck. Be prepared to pull a lot of all nighters. Will hurt your GPA  but the class is very interesting and she's nice about extra credit  second chances and personal struggles.
1,The class was not useful at all. The most important thing is that this professor is fake and do not respect the students. Don't take her class.
3,Take this class if you're genuinely passionate about Asian American history. A lot of the people that didn't like her  weren't really interested in the content. She's very vague when it comes to assignments. There's a midterm  a final  and some outside work. But as long as you put that you deserve an A on the self evaluations  you'll get an A.
1,"Terrible. She's confusing and not clear about what she wants. She will change her mind every five seconds. Takes forever to grade homework and papers. Everything that she says is ""right"" so you better agree with her."
1,I can't express how much I disliked her and this entire course. This course should have been driven through discussion and opions  but seems too only care about her opinions. She give too much work and grades way too harshly. If you miss one small thing on notes alone you will fail that assignment. Do yourself a favor and avoid her at all cost
1,This professor only lectures about why students should be good people and be classy. Come time for our midterm  everyone asked what the test was going to be on because no material was covered or understandable in class. There wasn't even enough time to take her midterm because she talked the majority of the time about her day. Never again.
2.5,Professor Lee stated from the first class that she is a strict professor. However  sometimes she is unclear with what she expects. Her discussions were interesting (although sometimes irrelevant from the topic  but the time go by faster). Her class is easy to pass if you do the work and ask questions when her instructions aren't clear.
2.5,"Don't do it. Just don't... So much reading. She goes off topic. Not clear about anything. Doesn't remember due dates. The midterm and Final are essay exams. She's late to office hours. The subject is interesting but her class is ""No Bueno"""
1,Simple. Do not take her. She never replies to emails  she's very snappy in group chat if you ask a question. She also gives low grades on assignments and it is a requirement to watch movies in the library (even though it's an online class). She grades work late and gives a ton of work and it's only a 100 class. Everyone in my class failed.
1,The worst professor Ive ever had. She isnt clear on her outlines she wants certain material on the outlines but gives you such a broad topic. At office hours she will give you a lecture of what you're doing wrong but will not tell you how to better your work. And she's off topic 90 percent of the time. She also treats you like grade school students
2.5,I dont like history classes  but I did like that she is very understanding and passionate for what she lectures. Students who take this course think that you need to know a lot about AAS  but this is a beginners course  which she does remind us multiple times throughout the semester that she does not expect us to be experts on the subject.
1.5,online  met about 3 times throughout the semester! You must attend and be there the whole class time or she will mark you down. The book i highly used in the course  all your assignments are assigned from the book. Was not clear with instructions! groups were horrible  new groups each week
5,This class covers topics in detail and the professor is very helpful and knowledgeable. Participate  get involved  DO THE WORK and you'll do well in the class. Professor is very understanding of students. This is a 400 level class  you're expected to perform at a high standard. She gives good feedback too. Just dedicate yourself and you'll be fine
1,I took AAS 100 last Fall 2014 with the hope that it will be worth it. It wasn't. She was so unclear about so many things and there was even an instance when she told us what she wanted in our paper ON THE DAY IT WAS DUE. She also throws occasionally insensitive comments out there  so watch out. Did I learn? Yes  but not from her.
2,Labs are short. Tests don't really cover what is covered in class. Textbook is not used.
4,Heywood is a great guy. He is full of knowledge and his passionate about the subjects that he teaches. All of his test and quizzes you can do by yourself or in groups on your own time outside of class. He gives you them a week ahead of time so you don't have to cram for anything. He tape records all his lectures and powerpoints and puts them on D2L
1.5,I would never take a class with him again. He was a nice enough guy  and gave us many opportunities to get a good grade  however his exams/quizzes were very hard and very stressful. I felt as if going to class was pointless because the questions on quizzes/exams were nothing like what he talked about in class. Absolutely infuriating.
5,Environmental Hazards is a great class. Should be renamed to search and rescue. Dr. Heywood brings alot of experience to the class from his navy days. He is a great person to talk to and to get to know but be warned hes a talker for sure.
4.5,Very good teacher  highly recommend him as a teacher if you have to take Geo 101  he makes the work easy to understand and worth learning
4.5,Phenomenal professor. Lectures were easy to listen to and fairly interesting even if geography isn't your favorite subject. Helpful guy. Test's and quizzes are all online and they are fair. Highly recommend Heywood if you want a nice grade in a 5 Credit course.
5,"Heywood is an absurdly easy prof  his attitude is ""your grade is what matters  not how you get it""  so all the tests are online  you can do them in groups  the quizzes have exact questions a few days ahead of time online  etc. That said  he's funny  smart  and not hard to listen to in lecture. And he's got an epic beard. Total badass"
4,Great professor! Records every lecture and puts them online in case you miss class. Doesn't grade labs. Makes the class accessible
2,For intro level course he was impossible to listen to. I don't know if it was his odd mannerisms or slow  drawn out style but I found it impossible to pay attention in a subject I love. The material in class was less than half of what was on the test  reading the dry text was mandatory.
4.5,"Heywood is an amazing professor! He is one of very few whom I truly believe understands the ""real world"" and its workings. Willing to help you out with most anything - even if it has nothing to do directly with Geography. Very insightful  understanding and helpful. Would definately take courses from him again. EASY A in a 5 CREDIT course."
3,He really does make it easy for student  however  I don't feel like he has any ability to teach. Very hard to understand  but you don't need to listen in lectures to pass.
4.5,Neil is a great professor. Very passionate about students and the material. All tests and quizzes are online. He also gives you the PDF file of the test/quiz before hand so you can print it off and work on it with a group before submitting it online. Easy 5 credit A if you are willing to put the time into it  which is not a hard task to do.
4.5,Prof. Heywood is an awesome teacher
3.5,This was a good class  pretty easy. He is a very understanding guy and willing to help and likes answering questions from students. Labs were not graded but you needed to attend to understand concepts. Graded on 5 lab quizzes (5% of total grade each) and 3 exams (25% of total grade each) Quizzes and Exams online.
3,He records his lectures and puts them online  the labs are not graded  you get the tests and quizzes beforehand (he even encrourages you to work with others on them) and then you post your answers online (D2L). He also curves tests/quizzes slightly.
3,It is a more difficult 5 credit class  but in the end your grade could be better than what you may think. He can be very helpful  but you must approach him. You should have some interest in the atmosphere  biosphere  and lithosphere.
4.5,probably the easiest five credit class you can take at Point  doesnt grade the labs you grade is determined by quiz and exam scores  really nice guy willing to help whenever you need it
3.5,He's a funny guy. He started out every class with a half an hour talk about stuff not related to class at all  and often made it seem like the world is ending  but I guess it kept the class interesting. Course content gets confusing  but grades usually end up higher than I thought they would be.
2.5,what is this guy talking about he teaches 101 like its an advanced course. I tried really really hard ended up doing ok  he's interesting when hes not talking about class material. He makes a lot of things seem like they are going to create armagedon strange guy
5,Does an outstading job only testing you on what you should have learned  labs are quite easy and lectures are very well paced.
3,Beneski is very monotone and the lectures are dry. You need to go to class and take good notes because he goes into much more detail just off the top of his head. In order to get a good grade you have to be able to apply the material in the test. Start to prepare for the test 2 weeks in advance. Its doable.
1,he makes bio so hard to understand. Very smart but doesn't know how to make the material easy to understand at all. I studied incredibly hard for his exams  worked with friends  etc. and failed all exams. There are 4 exams all worth 100 points. He crams 5/6 weeks work of material into one Exam. you will be lost with him as your teacher.
1,WORST PROFESSOR AT WCU! I have never had such a rude & uncaring professor. His lectures do little to prepare you for the exam and his power points are confusing and have slim to none useful info on them. I am pretty sure he is glad that his class is close to impossible. Not sure why he's a professor because it seems like he hates students & his job
1,The class needs a complete upgrade from the way information is given. The lectures are very heavy and dry with plenty of terms and functions being explained in a short amount of time. Beneski does not give study guides  test reviews  worksheets  or any practice work to help you before the exams. He flys through info
1,I studied for hours  made over 100 note cards and watched videos on the topics he had on his slides (the slides have no information on them). None of that helped me with his exam as they are all applied questions  and extra material not in the slides. He does not answer any my emails with questions and simply does not care. He is horrible and rude.
3,The material is extremely dull  but he really makes you remember that it is dull. He tries to confuse you  but you just need to write down every single thing he says. If you attend every class and take notes  you will pass. I studied a lot from the terms of words and it helped a ton even though his last two tests seemed foreign.
4,A lot of people blame Beneski for his teaching style  but really it is just a difficult course. If you attend every lecture  take good notes  and study what he says you should be able to do decently on the tests. Even if you don't understand what he is saying  write it down and study it later because it will most likely be on the test.
2,Beneski clearly knows his stuff but does not know how to teach it to others. Lectures are boring and monotone  making it very difficult to focus. Tests expect you to completely understand every aspect of the material as well as be able to apply it to situations. Recommend studying for tests weeks in advance  record the lectures and watch videos.
3,He is okay at explaining things but definitely go to class  the slides are useless. Recording the lectures is helpful because the tests are extremely hard. Be careful with the online quizzes too  he never reminds you and they're easy to miss and forget about.
1,He is trash. I had 3 tests and 2 lab practicals and each test and practical was completely different than the last making it almost impossible to know how to study. The 2 lab practicals in particular were a complete 180 from each other we basically guaranteed me to fail. He is mean  uncaring  and he likes to make rules to hurt you.
1,He really knows what hes talking about but he isn't the best teacher. Lectures are very monotone and the only grades are exams and 2 homework's a month. He doesn't tell you about any deadlines  you are just expected to know when the tests are and when the homework's are due. His class does not co-inside with the lab at all!!
3,Interesting material but Beneski is really dry. He has a few good jokes  but the material is just so hard and it is hard to focus. Anatomy will take up your life so be prepared to study hard. It is doable.
2,Beneski is a very smart man and really knows his stuff about anatomy  but he is not the best at teaching it. He lectures very monotone and it can be hard to keep up with so I recommend recording the lectures because you need to know literally every little detail for the exams. You need to put at least 10 hours in a week if you want a good grade.
1,Extremely hard class and Beneski's teaching styles do not help. Recorded the lectures and studied for hours on end and could still only manage C's. Best bet is to watch videos on the topics because the tests are all applied questions. Good luck.
3,Dr. Beneski has a pretty monotoned voice but he knows his stuff. His lectures are dry and can be ridiculously boring but going is essential and worth it. It is a hard course but it is totally doable. Flash cards will be your lifesaver.
2,Tests are extremely difficult  definitely go to lecture and read the textbook
1,Beneski is an intellegent man   he knows what he is talking about but is an awful professor. He has no idea on how to relay the message. Anatomy is a comprehensive class in which you have to take a 50 question test in 50 minutes  its absoutley obsurd. I got roofied one weekend and he wouldn't let me re-take a quiz  I had my hospital records also.
3,Some people are not used to the terminology  so that can get confusing if you don't already have prior knowledge about anatomy. The two most important things are: attending lecture and taking really good notes. His tests are all based off of what he says  so re-read your notes to understand thoroughly.
1,Dr. Beneski was by far the worst professor I have ever had. He was impatient  cocky  and he was not very good at explaining the material. Most students have to retake his courses and he is proud of it. I strongly suggest you steer clear of this professor.
3.5,Beneski is a little monotone  but if you pay attention he's very good at explaining and the class can be easy. Don't skip class. He has powerpoints online  but he goes into much more detail during class. He'll say something once  and it might pop up on a test. Take good notes. Overall  he's a good teacher.
4.5,Very helpful and outgoing. Tests aren't difficult if you actually do the reading and note taking. I will take every class i can with Dr. Grover.
5,Best Professor ever  learned everything from mapping and rock formations to life lessons from the best professor/advisor I have ever had.
5,Great Professor. Loved the Classes.
5,He's a great teacher  and his classes are fun you just have to pay close attention  and you'll never get by if you don't go to class.
1,All I learned was that he was obsessed with very small dinosaur anatomy. Certain parts really fascinated him which made the class pretty amusing.
5,i took a class with tim for geology. it was a 1000 level class but the tests are sooo hard! hes a great teacher but you have to really study and not dick around if you want to do well.
4,Dr. Grover is one of Castleton's best teachers. He is interesting and real. His class is not easy  but if you show up and take notes you should be okay. He makes learning fun! He is very intelligent. If you get the chance take his class you wont regret it.
1,Not very helpful at all.
1,How did he become a Doctor? His classes were lower school level.
5,Fun class  Great Guy  highly recomend it to anyone who needs a 1 credit fun class. great exercise
4.5,good teacher  great guy.
5,Dr. Grover is one of the best teachers that Castleton has. If you want to know why the rock effervesces I recommend some Geochem.
1,I did the same experiments in middle school. Wow! acid makes the rock sizzle--Ask him why and he doesn't know! It seems anyone these days can be a doctor. Tries to be a T. rex but is really a trilobite.

5,I loved professor Root! I had her for body conditioning and she was so nice and amazing. The class works you  and make you feel like you've had a good work out! Root really cares about her job  and her students. I would definitely take again.
5,This class was interesting and an easy A. Really  Trish just wants you to show that you are involved in this class. She is a clear grader and her readings are all online. (saves you a textbook!) Her tests give you two chances to pass so that makes it really convenient.
5,I learned many things about health science from her class. Class discussion posts are confusing (hard to follow). She gives extra credits  so if you work hard you
4.5,You can tell she loves to teach. She's incredible helpful and fair. No textbook required. All reading is online. Her syllabus is very clear. Would highly recommend taking a class with her. She is also a phys ed instructor so you might see her around the wellness center a lot.
5,I have taken 2 classes with Trish and she is pretty amazing. If you have taken biology or chemistry before Health class should be easy A. gives a lot of extra credit and her assignments are so fun to do.
5,Very fun class  nice teacher. Loved the set up of the online course and no text book use.
5,Trish was amazing! One of the most caring and inspirational professors I've had!
5,best teacher ever!
5,Trish is AWESOME!!! She is one of the best PE teachers I've ever had. She is not only very skilled  but funny and really cares for her students! She creates a workout routine based on her students needs! It's easy to get an A if you attend her class! Take her!!!! I will sure take her again! :-)
5,Trish is to date my favorite teacher at NSCC and she was online! Super nice and extremely helpful  she manages to have a really interesting class and be nice all at the same time! AWESOME!
5,Trish is amazing! She makes the class very fun and enjoyable. The class votes on what 8-10 activities you do throughout the quarter and it was fun experiencing many types of workouts. There are online weekly readins  and then a mid-term and final based on the readings. She is very helpful and I definitley recommend her class!
5,Trish is great! I got a good workout of the class  beat my scores on the final fitness test compared to the initial fitness test  and had a wonderful time getting in shape in total body conditioning! I only wish we could have spent more time on the cardio demanding workouts. Trish is fun and funny  take her!
4.5,nice
4,Trish is understanding and easy to work with. She is really nice and she explains everything on a weekly basis for online learning. Lots of reading though and lots of home work. she did give a midterm and a quiz only a couple days away. nice but hard
5,Trish is GREAT! I had so much fun in her Step & Sculpt class. We were always doing new stuff so it was never boring. and I lost 10lbs!!!!! I took it last quarter. I loved it so much that I'm taking it again this quarter.
3.5,She's really nice and makes an effort to get to know you. Her class is definitely challenging  but the benefits are great. I had an okay time in her class  it wasn't the best time but it wasn't horrific either.
5,Great teacher. She is patient and laid back. I took her for Total Body Conditioning. She is sweet and teaches well.
3,Online class. Too much reading  too many unimportant details in the readings. It is poorly written which makes it difficult to read and understand.
5,Challenging but fun PE class. Great teacher.
5,Awesome
5,Awesome teacher. I looked forward to going to his class. He's funny  helpful  and caring. You have four homework assignments (which are just a paragraph each)  you need to do a ten minute presentation  you have to read a GOOD book and write a summary about it *thats the final* his class is easy. He's such a nice man. His class is fun!
4.5,favorite professor ever! only one final paper  and then exams (easy) class was intersting and he always had people laughing. mouth like a truck driver sometimes  doesnt hold back. doesnt teach by the book  never had to open it once during the semester either. had him for criminology and juvenile justice. take him for every class that you can!
4.5,good guy  a little conservative for my personal taste but comes with the course background. Has a mouth like a truck driver so if you are offended by language I would avoid  otherwise take him. Funny and entertaining.
5,This guy rules! Never took attendance but class was so interesting  always wanted to go. Whatever he is teaching  TAKE IT! Exams are take home  one small paper. Teaches from experience  and great stories.
4.5,Great teacher. Doesnt rely on book that much and teaches from expierence. Has great stories  lets us out early and gives a easy take home midterm. Great class to take. Highly Recommended.
5,This guy is great. He has great stories and is so so funny. He doesn't take attendance but you want to go to this class. Def take this class
5,He is awesome! Enough said. I took him for Juvenile Justice and Criminology. He is great. He knows what he is talking about. He teaches from his experience as a police chief...not by the book.
5,No Comments
5,He is one of the greatest teachers that I've had throughout my college career. One of the few teachers thats actually not out to get you and is there to help. Take him for Criminology - great course  awesome teacher
5,HE IS THE MAN...TAKE HIM FOR CRIMINOLOGY  GREAT TEACHER.
4.5,No Comments
2,Took him for physics in sports many years ago  and he was HORRIBLE. Absolutely horrible. How I wound up with a B in there was this: I taught myself  and got my hands on a practice exam. Outside of that  he was useless then.
1,I do not recommend this professor. He often mumbles  so it is very hard to take notes  and he does not follow the book. He is very disorganized  and when he looses your papers  he holds you accountable. He is also very unreachable  since he does not use his email or blackboard. This class is set for the student to fail  and is very stressful.
1,Horrible teacher. Avoid at all costs. He writes all the exams himself  so they are filled with errors. You teach yourself the class. And he talks about his dead dog Ginger constantly and uses her in 75% of the exam questions.
1,"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. The exams are a load of crap. He doesn't teach anything that's on it and we would spend a whole class talking about two equations that we he openly admitted we didn't have to learn. He lost my first exam  didn't come to class because he ""lost track of time."" I withdrew from this class as fast as I could. He's horrible."
1,I'm a 3.5 gpa student and I dropped this course because of that man behind the podium. He's the most unreasonable  arrogant man I may possibly have ever met. Overall a useless professor that takes advantage of his paycheck. Do NOT take any class he is associated with. I wasted around $1 500 because I didn't read his ratings. Learn from my mistake.
1,"Absolute worst professor any one in college could ever take. He does absolutely nothing to help the students. Half of what he ""teaches"" had nothing to do with the class. I actually tried to go in to his office hours to ask for help  but after one question he smiled  laughed  and turned his back on me. Overall he's rude and the most useless profesor"
1,Worst professor I've ever had. I took physics in high school and got an A. Taking him  I thought that maybe college physics was just more difficult. But I needed the physics credit  so I took the class with a different prof and got an A. It really is him! He really shouldn't be teaching anymore.
1,Short and simple: you teach yourself physics. Do not have him as your teacher.
1,This is the most terrible professor I ever had. Refuses to answer questions. He has admitted many times he does not know how to do some of the homework problems. The average on the open book tests are always about 50 percent. I have gotten all A's in college and got a C in this class. He will not curve tests. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PROFESSOR!!
3.5,I think he's well past his prime  mentally speaking. But he is a really nice guy and made sure to help us in any way possible. In office ours  going over hmwk in class  giving extra-credit. Open note exams  with questions often coming straight from lecture or Homework.
1,I've had this professor twice now for two different classes and he tries to teach the exact same material. He told us in class that he expects us to learn it on our own  and he expects that we will fail. With having a open note  open book and partner test and the class average was 51% DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR.
1,this guy is horrible. his lectures are pointless  he doesnt know how to use a computer so good luck getting your grade. He doesnt answer questions in class. I made appointments to see him in his office and he only showed for 1 0f 3. He builds on the easy material in the book to make them tougher.DO NOT TAKE THIS PROF!
1,Worst prof ever. Class was a lab it had little to do with actual physics. If you followed his instructions perfectly he would still tell you it is wrong and walk away without explaining a bit. Don't take him if you can help it!
1.5,I am completely lost in this class. I've never taken a physics class and considering the fact that I want to go into music  i thought musical acoustics would be an awesome class. i have not learned a thing and i feel like i'm failing. thank goodness for the credit/no credit option..
1.5,DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!! The class seems like it will be easy on the first day because you get take home exams  open note quizzes and most of the homework problems done for you in class. However  since Phelps does everything different than the book and doesn't explain things you will not learn anything. Which means the exams suck. AVOID!!!
3.5,This class took up a lot of my time. I got A's in 130/131. You need to utilize office hours but all of his tests are take home and he re-uses them from past years. Find a group that suits you well and you CAN get an A. He offers between 50-100 points extra credit on every exam and the quizzes every Thursday are straight from the notes.
3.5,I love Dr. Phelps! if you take the time to go to his office hours  he will help you with anything you need! He helps a lot with homework and even exam questions. he does tend not to teach much during class but he makes up for it during office hours!
1,If you have Phelps  be prepared to teach yourself physics. As everyone else has said he gives no partial credit so don't be surprised to get a lot of zeros on quizzes or test questions. Only benefit of taking him is that you get take home exams  which is good only if you know what you're doing.
1,WORST TEACHER OF MY LIFE!!!! I have had some pretty bad teachers this man by far was the worst I would never take another class with him if my life depended on it. If you have him drop it soon.
2,Awful teacher. He doesn't teach the concepts associated with physics. When you go to his office hours for help he'll make you sit and wait while he takes personal calls then he talks down to you. He will mark correct answers wrong if he doesnt think in his opinion you knew how to do it. Take any other physics teacher.
4,Professor is hilarious  all class periods are predominantly lectures. There is a lot of reading outside of class  some of which didnt seem very valuable. Hardly anything is assigned  and this class is an easy 4.0!
5,Rick is such a great prof. I feel like I can just sit back and learn in his class! No homework or reading (2 chapters assigned but not mandatory) I dont see why anyone would object amazing lectures and easy A. Only downside is that he has cancelled class without email. Swears a lot! Very knowledgeable about worldly issues which is refreshing.
5,Recommend Rick 120%. His American Gov course was amazing
5,Omg. BEST TEACHER IN NORTH SEATTLE COLLEGE. I wish every teacher would be like Rick!
4,Amazing and funny lectures  has a very honest view of American Government which I enjoy. His quizzes and papers are super easy  I literally read / learned nothing and still got a 4.0. Make sure you turn stuff in  because if not he might not get back to you to turn in late work. Also  assignments are due at 5:00 PM  not 11:59!
5,Rick is a wonderful professor--engaging  intellectual  and intelligent. He is passionate about political science and how it affects daily life. Lectures can be dramatic  amusing  and poignant. Although you probably won't need to take notes (work is minimal)  I ended up writing down many inspirational things he said. Awesome class and teacher!
4,This professor has an innate understanding of the American government and taught it in a way that students could relate to. I really enjoyed his lectures. I came into this class prepared with a notebook  thinking that there'd be a lot of PowerPoint notes I'd have to write down  but I was mostly just writing down quotes of cool stuff he said.
5,I had Olguin before for political science and loved his class. His classes are entertaining and very easy but the fact that he gets students involved and to actually think outside of the box is what gets our mind rolling. I like that he finds interesting ways to engage the students in projects  lectures  and different perspectives of the mind.
3,Take him for PS. He says F word a lot  but everyone likes it. His lectures are inspirational  you'll never get bored listen to him. He assumes that students know everything about the US government  and he expects you to know a lot! I didn't know a thing  so ended up dropping the class. But definitely come back for those great lectures when im ready
1.5,I actually liked him until the end of quarter. He didn't post the grades for any extra credits and even the final  therefore I had no clue of how I got a grade lower than what I expected. When I asked him politely about that after the quarter ended  he was being very careless at answering my questions. I will never in my life take his class again.
4,Easy A. Class can be confusing. Just follow all the required materials. Goodluck!
5,"Rick is the only professor I've ever had that I'd describe as ""badass"". He's done some acting in the past and it shows - his lectures are engaging  funny  and thorough enough to be thought-provoking. Seriously  each one of his lectures sounds like it's own TED talk by the end. He is also very open to student input and answers questions on the fly."
3.5,I took his American Gov class online during the summer. I read the textbook  took notes  and looked at his supplemental materials. However  for his quizzes it was unclear what to study for. The practices tests were nothing like the actual ones. However he is very easy to get in touch with and responds quickly to e-mails/texts.
3.5,Rick is an amazing teacher. He is not your typical community college teacher  he is highly educated and so passionate. His lectures are interesting and probative every single day. He is technologically savvy and utilizes many internet resources during lecture. This is my second class with him and I have never been bored during a single lecture.
4,Rick is an awesome instructor! I am about to take my third class from him. If you are easily offended or want someone to reassure you all the time  he not the teacher for you. Rick will give you the easy A but if you want to learn he has a lot to teach you! Go to the first day and you will know if you are going to enjoy his class.
4,Really good teacher overall and very passionate about his subject. If you don't like essay tests  you will fail. Main grades are from an essay midterm and final. Not hard if you do some preparation. He lets you have notes during it. I will take his classes again and I recommend him. Watch out... you may actually enjoy his lectures.
3,Very knowledgeable about the American government. Each class is a lecture and youre graded only on quizzes (submitted through angel online) and two bluebook exams. All quiz material is based on the textbook and not his lectures  so if you miss a day or a few days then just make sure to keep up with the textbook.
4,Very knowledgeable about his subject. Quizzes and essay tests are the only grades given  so be sure to prepare for those.
5,Mr. Olguin is an eccentric and awesome teacher. He is not like most teachers that offer you a strict regiment of course load that you must adhere to and demand that you understand it in a certain way. Your curiosity and inquisitiveness is the limit in this class. U will be rewarded for the work you do. Students are like sheep. You must be a wolf.
2.5,Sometimes interesting lecturer  but terribly scattered and disorganized. He canceled many classes with no warning and no substitute. Pretty easy grade if you half pay attention. Not recommended.
4,Pros: --This class is what he really likes doing so he gets pretty exited about it. --Fun projects if you have time for them. Cons: --Projects can be really hard if you have no experience in computer forensics. --Reads off slides. Overall: --Amidst the dry lectures and hard projects the class was really cool and the professor was helpful too.
5,Brett is a really nice and fun professor. He cares a lot about this subject (forensics) and lectures were always really interesting to me. His class consists of just 4 projects and a final. The projects are challenging and can be time consuming  but they are overall fair. He does a good job of helping you out if you need it.
1,Dr. Tjaden is such a dark spot among all the other great professors in the department. Every class was lecture read word for word from the textbook slides. Projects do not have clear criteria and require you talking to him a dozen times to actually understand them. Majorly disappointed in this class and professor.
3,PAs are impossible unless you are a C wizard.
5,75% of the grade was PAs which were group based. If you got a bad group you had to do a ton of work on your own. It is able to be done solo if you have a lot of time. Tests were straightforward and all from material taught in class. Show up and pay attention  know how to program in C  and you'll get an A. Tjaden is a nice guy and willing to help.
3.5,Tjaden is extremely smart and really knows his stuff  but this class is hard. There is a ton of individual work to be done. His lectures are helpful  but google honestly helped me way more than his lectures.
2,This was a networking course  however the projects required writing c++ programs  and the grades were based on how well you program was written and how well it worked. It really didn't matter how well you may know networking.
5,One of the best teachers I've ever had. He is fair and straight forward  very reasonable. Very clear and lucid in his assignments. Nothing out of the ordinary which is a god send in computer science. Best professor in the department.
5,Meanest professor at JMU! At least thats what he wants everyone to think. Really nice guy  great teacher  knows his stuff. I hear he can give a lot of work but for this class wasn't much. I looked forward to every class especially halloween  elvis's birthday  and talk like a pirate day...he dresses up!
5,I actually looked forward to this class every week. Very well organized notes and a good lecturer. Very helpful outside of class also. Take him if you get the chance.
1,This guy has some serious issues. I suggest avoiding him at all cost. You can get online and teach yourself way more than this jackass could ever convey!
4.5,Good class.
4.5,The hardest class I ever loved
4.5,Great class. Not too hard. I learned a lot.
5,best class i ever took
1.5,No Comments
3,Very tough grading. Can be easier in giving grades and assignments.
2,Made the class a lot more difficult than it should have been. Didn't give clear instructions and started changing the material half way through it. Expect to spend rediculous amounts of time in the lab.
5,Excellent
5,Professor Dirks is a great and inspirational leader.
5,Professor Dirks is the main MAN!
5,The Best!
5,I took him for five classes. I learned more about history of government than I ever thought I would. A very entertaining teacher that kept me wanting to come back to class every single time.
3.5,Easy A. Talks alot  but has interesting things to say.
4,Dirks can have interesting lectures. But I've sat through some lectures that had absolutely nothing to do with poli sci. He just blabbed for an hour and a half about his wife or some movie he saw. His blabbing is entertaining though. And i've seen him cry
2,Dr. Parker is a very nice lady  but this was the worst class I've taken at UA. If you are a business major  do not take this class. You're much better off taking an entrepreneurship class in the business school  you'll actually learn something relative to modern day. The 2.5 hour class is all lecture from slides you could print and read yourself.
5,AWESOME! Mrs. Parker is a great business professor along with life coach for the class in entrepreneurship. She loves what she does and is very interesting with the care and affection to her students as if she is your mother or grandmother! Her class with Mr. Hester was great and will cherish the class forever. Class was a life changing experience!
5,Great person!
2,She did not explain her assignments very well and when did not clarify when we needed to turn things in. She was extremely disorganized as well. The class was easy but all we did was listen to her read notes outloud that we could print off the internet. The class time was used very poorly
3.5,No Comments
2,she was very unorganized. and did not actually teach. she is very nice and i believe she helps you with your grade too.
5,No Comments
5,Excellent teacher
1.5,The class was too easy and very poor by college standards. I transferred to a better school after being disappointed by how juvenile the course is. The professor  while friendly  comes off too self-centered at times and not very knowledgeable.
2.5,Too easy
5,Soni is such a happy  outgoing person. She makes going to class worthwhile. And her classes are designed to make sure you understand what she's talking about  so as long as you show up and have a positive attitude you'll do well.
5,After attending another college I have changed my opinion of Soni from really good to wonderful. she is so willing to work with the group and one on one. She is also a fantastic transfer counselor.
2,No Comments
5,Soni is an excellent teacher  she is really committed to student development. I loved having her for a teacher.
5,Soni is such a great teacher! She teaches in an interesting manner and uses real life examples.

5,It is mandatory to take religion at Bryn Athyn and I did so without the best attitude. However Thane and The New Church's approach to religion is thoughtful and inspiring. It is quite evident that Thane really cares about the material he is teaching and the students. I am a better person for having had this class.
3,Very knowledgeable on the subject  amusing way of communicating. All around a nice dude.
5,awesome

1,she is the worst teacher ever. she is really unfair when she give your work back. in our class there is a girl who cant speak english she passes the class bc of her politeness but I got C even I dont have any C in my work. she is the WORST TEACHER. if you are going to be in her class I would prefer to shoot myself. I hate her
4.5,Every week essays  every week essays. what the heck is that. I am tired of writing her essays. I almost wrote a thick book because of her. Oh my god I can't explain my feelings.
4,Oh man Oh man..what more can i say...
2.5,"TOO many essays and work (we have other classes you know)  very stubborn and disagreeable. It's ESL  why so difficult? Class is easy for me  because I was ""accidently"" placed there."
2,Take this course if you're ready to be treated like you did nothing. She's great outside of class  but it's her way or the high way.
1.5,Often unfair and arbitrary in her grading.
5,she is very strict and hard on students  but when the class i took with her was over i realized that i learned a lot more than i learn with easy teachers... shes also very passionate about what she teaches

4.5,good
4.5,Very helpful and educated.
5,I think that she is a very good teacher for speech. I am not sure that some of her views that she might express align correctly with the foundemental beliefs of bryn athyn college. But she did not generally express these views in speech.
3.5,This is where she's a good teacher.
2.5,Ugh. Don't take writing from Suzanne. She's a better teacher at speech and theater.
1,Worst teacher ever.
1,It's either her way or the highway. If it's her way you're fine and can be in her club. If you have a different oppinion  you'd better invest in body armor because you will be attacked. But in her defense  I don't think she's aware that she does it. Doesn't change the fact that she does.

2.5,She's very particular about the topics and views she wants to read in the student's papers  if she doesn't like it then she seems to keep the grade low. She can be nice as a person but a tad boring as a teacher in this class-going over grammar rules instead of how to write a good essay.
2,Oh my gosh...
2.5,I won't say that I dislike her. Because I do not. She and I had very different views about the world which just didn't mix. She is a good teacher when it comes to theatre though or at least thats what I hear.
1,I heard she was gone  I hope so. She is not to be trusted. She'll be nice until you screw up and then you'll wish you never knew her. I have not been the same since she screwed with my life.
5,Anybody who does not think Prof. Senchack is one of the best teachers ever is sorely mistaken  and likely lazy. People who feel embarrassed only do so because they do not properly prepare for class. the few who actually put in effort are rewarded with one of the most rewarding experiences learning in the field of finance
1,Took him for Business research and writing. Main thing I have to say is if I never see him again it will be too soon. Within the first week of class he insulted a student. Really good at telling you how wrong and stupid you are but doesn't tell you what he wants and how to fix it. very particular but doesn't tell you specifics until afterwards
3,Old fashioned. Nothing visual all term. Confusing  circuitous lectures. Class was a killer...stay away.
1.5,Extremely rude  publicly embarassed students on several occasions without legitimate justification. I will NEVER take another class from him and would NOT recommend him to any other students.
5,Wonderful professor. Cares about students and is highly dedicated to the topics he teaches.
1,Unprofessional. Waste of time taking his classes.
4,always makes class interesting...
4.5,Easily side-tracked...but his tangents are VERY amusing!

5,Another wonderful prof! you learn so much from him!
1.5,This lady is crazy! I took her for calc 3 expecting it to be not as bad and boy was I wrong! She makes no efforts to make sure her students succeed  hammers everyone on grading  and her tests are impossible. Not to mention the racist rant she went on in the middle of my class. She can explain it well but other than that she's awful. Stay away!
2,I definitely would not recommend taking her class. She is a nice woman but not the best teacher. She teaches the easy things pretty well but when it comes to the confusing stuff  she speeds right through it. She gives out way too much homework (online and worksheets) and doesn't accept any excuses. She is also very stingy about grading.
5,Mrs. Lair is the best math teacher I have ever had. She is VERY organized with her lecture notes and explains things very clearly. She is willing to help whenever a student asks a question. However  you must be prepared for the class. If you don't know the prerequisite material for the course  you are in big trouble. Be responsible!
3.5,I think one of the pitfalls reviewers of Lair fell into was not going to see her or staying a few minutes after class to ask questions. She looked scary & set tough rules  but when talked to  she relaxed many of the rules & was very helpful. Her class is par for the course  its math & requires work out side of class to pass  o look for it.
2,"Vickie Lair is THE WORST teacher I have ever had. I would not be in her class if it wasn't the only opening left (wonder why?) She's confusing  forgetful  and very unreasonable when it comes to class. She doesn't post grades EVER. ""It's your responsibility."" Her reviews for tests are barely that and she crams everything together. Don't take her!!!"
1.5,Horrible. She was no help and gets confused as she writes on the board.
1,She has to be the WORST teacher I have EVER had!! I got a problem wrong on my hw simply because I didnt put a dash in my z  so she argued that it was a 2! I would have problems correct  but still have no points for the problems because of fact she requires you document EVERY SINGLE STEP even the minor ones! DONT TAKE HER CLASS!!!
1.5,"She grades way to hard  taking points off for a misplaced negative sign even if the answer is right. I asked her for help pulling my grade up and she said ""you're smart you'll figure it out"". She gets confused and when asked a question just repeats how she explained it before until they give up and say they get it. DO NOT TAKE HER."
4.5,Mrs. Lair turned out to be a great teacher. She seems scary but DO NOT be afraid to ask her questions. Her homework is tough but will help you in the long run if you plan on going any further with math. She was more than willing to meet with me outside of class.
1,I went over a homework problem with this woman. We went over it twice and she told me everything was correct. I turned it in and when I got it back  I got 4/5 points for that same problem. That how she grades. I strongly recommend you not take any of her classes.
1,NEVER TAKE HER! thanks God she's not teaching next semester because I have to retake her class. Makes students feel stupid which immediately drops my interest in the class  very hard grader (to a ridiculous point) and gets confused in her own words  which confused everyone because we don't even know how to approach the problem. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE
1,DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS! she made things so much harder then they needed to be. She makes you show work for every tiny detail (simple adding and subtracting) I didn't listen to a review I read and took the course  listen to this one and DONT!
1,God Awful teacher! DO NOT TAKE THIS INSTRUCTOR: She does not explain anything well  You are better off reading the book yourself  then even going to lecture. I'm pissed I even payed for this quality of education  it would not be worth my time if it was free.
2,Very hard teacher. I get straight A's in my previous math courses in college but could not learn from her. VERY picky. Should have dropped earlier to get a refund but I decided to stick it out. Dropped just before first test as I knew she couldn't teach me. Only concerned with getting through material  not how well she covers or explains it.
2,She was not a helpful professor. She always had to derive an equation and prove it. Her method of grading was awful. At the end of the course she had to drop 8 of the lowest homework grades because the entire class was doing so poorly.
4,She was a hard grader but she always explained what was deficient clearly. The homework was not extremely long  except on a few instances. She had trouble with a new book this quarter  but she graded us less harshly where she knew we would have troubles. Her lecture often differed from the book  but her lectures were in-depth and explanatory.
1.5,She takes off points for simple arithmetic. On our last test she made us memorize ten problems that were all fairly similar. She did so because she thinks we should compete with her calculus class. She rarely teaches from the actual book and instead teaches from her own notes which are not available unless you copy them.
1,try to stay away from this professor. rarely prepared for class. will often not lecture for a section  gives a handout covering section instead. Gives pop quizzes if a phone rings  does not give enough time for tests.she gave a test that contained a problem that she was unable to solve. gives preferential treatment to students she appears to like
2.5,Always unclear as to what you should study for tests  which made them very difficult at times.
2.5,OMG...This teacher is a hard grader. She will take off if simple math  that you can do in your head  is not written down properly. She overexplains material to the point where it's just confusing. Oh yea and don't forget to leave your cell phone in class before you use the restroom or Pop Quiz!
1,worst class. The lecture is word for word from the book  with unclear explanations and no way to answer questions. This class was not supposed to be hard  but it was and more difficult with this instructor. She spent more time talking about investing in stocks and how she started a business when she was 12 years old than she did teaching !
1,RUN AWAY!!! Even though I was warned about her horrid teaching skills I still took the class thinking I could pass by learning independently or with a tutor... I was sooo wrong! Don't take stats with Judy! Her philosophy on teaching is students read the text book three times and don't ask questions. Worst teacher I have ever had! EVER!
1.5,Taught using videos for the first three weeks of class.
1,"Not worth driving  to make it to class  when all you need is the book in her class. She doesnt teach and expects you to just ""know it"". She also expects 3 hours  every night  for homework. Grades are based on tests."
1,Absolutely horrible!! She doesn't know how to teach. She teaches word for word out of the book and when you ask a question she won't answer it. Avoid this professor if at all possible. If she doesn't want to answer your question she will yell at you and kick you out. Totally pointless to even show up for class. I can teach better than she can!!!!!
1,Judy is a horrible HORRIBLE teacher. I am actually confused on why she even has a job still. She doesn't teach you anything  but rather plays a video of another person teaching the lesson and that's basically the class. If you ask her a question she does not answer it. I'm pretty sure I could teach the class better than her.
1,Shes the worst math teacher I've ever had. I feel like she doesn't know the material  if she does she doesn't teach it at all. Her tests are not what she teaches. It's not even worth doing the 2 hours of homework every night because it's only worth 50 points anyways. She doesn't want to help or explain. She yells at you if you ask for help.
1,If you enjoy paying a teacher that doesn't teach and only shows videos during class because she doesn't know the material .. Than she's your perfect teacher
1,Absolutely the worst teacher I have ever had. She makes you feel like a moron if you ask questions.
1,Spoke directly from the book  didn't prepare her own notes  was surprised by the answers to the problems she was reading out loud from the book.
1,Refuses to answer questions  does not explain steps to problems  only reads from the book. If you struggle with math at any level-DO NOT TAKE HER. She moves on even if you don't understand. doesnt follow through on her help
1,Horrible teacher! Do not take this class with her.
2,She was argumentative and often had to correct herself. She also would not let students try to give other explanations or examples. Very frustrating.
1,Would not recommend.
1.5,Poor Judy. She really is a nice lady. But nice doesn't help you understand math. She reaaaally sucks at explaining anything. She fills in class time with calculator work and random stories about her travels. I am taking stats from her  which is like a foreign language to begin with. She avoids your questions  too. Dodge her class if you can.
1,Please please please avoid taking a class by her if at all possible. If you must take one by her  get a tutor the instant you can sign up for one  you WILL need one. She is so hard to follow and doesn't answer questions very well.
1,please avoid if you want to learn anything i went to class and hour before class started and taught my classmates through the course since i had already taken it
1,Math 108-15
2.5,She was very hard to understand in her lectures as far as the lessons were concerned. She read almost everything out of the book. When we asked her questions  she would give us an answer that was never relevant to our questions. Avoid this teacher if you are looking for one that will teach you a lot.
1.5,had a very hard time following her when i didnt already know the subject  sticks to the sylibus and will not go over anything that she had already passed in lecture. aviod if at all possible.
3,I never read the material and made up crap for the essays and still mangae to get a B. All I can say is at least he kept me interested.
5,rad dude
4.5,Great guy  very nice. You will learn from this man. He is funny and will hold your attention. Papers are tough to write. They are a different style but they are not that bad. Great teacher I suggest learning under him
3.5,His papers are so hard to write. He is very unclear with what his guidelines are for the paper. He seriouly needs to know that we aren't taking this class because we want to. But other then that he is a very nice guy.
5,No Comments
5,Talks about interesting issues  even though don't always have anything to do with the tests  but you actually learn from the discussions  and the tests are very easy.
5,Smart  clear  funny!
4,Professor Rose was phenomenal & one of my favorite professors. His lectures are engaging & he is extremely knowledgeable about the media & communications industries. Definitely take him if you're looking to learn a lot  work hard  & have a professor who truly cares about each of his students! I would absolutely take another class with him again.
5,Professor Rose was the only professor my first semester who really challenged me. His lectures are consistently engaging but he expects a lot from each of his students. If you think you can meet some high expectations  take his class. He's extremely helpful  very clear in what he wants  and very passionate and knowledgeable about what he's teaching
5,I took Professor Rose's internship seminar after taking his Intro to Media Industries a few semesters ago. There's absolutely nothing bad to say about the experience with this class. The discussion board assignments we had were like journaling and he has a genuine interest in how students will take their careers. Take him  you won't regret it.
3.5,Professor Rose gives a lot of homework and reading. It is a lot to keep track of but he does send out helpful emails keeping you up to date. The workload is worth it because the lectures are very interesting and the homework/paper topics usually are as well. Beyond that  Prof Rose is just a pleasant professor to have and his passion is contagious
4.5,Although the workload was intense and there was a ton of reading  I wouldn't hesitate to take him again. This man responds to emails instantaneously and you are able to get help in an instant. The assignments he gives for outside of class are very fun as well. His lectures are interesting but take good notes. Great professor.
3.5,Professor Rose is accomplished in the industry. He's a tough grader  and he really cares about interest. Sit in the front. Answer questions. Come to class. You NEED to pay attention in the lectures. Take good notes  and read the current events articles: you're tested on them. There's weekly quizzes  usually based on the book  so yeah  you need it.
4,By far the BEST professor I have ever had at Fordham. This review mirrors the others  but I will reiterate. The workload is INTENSE so be prepared for multiple assignments due within days of each other. Midterm and final are extremely difficult  however he is a phenomenal professor and I learned so much from him. He knows his stuff. Take him!
4.5,One of the wisest professors I have had at Fordham. Class is lecture style but very engaging with presentations. He gives a lot of assignments but all are extremely meaningful and worth the time. If you are a Comm major you have to take his class- will learn so be able to connect the dots between the past  present and future of all media industries
2.5,i had rose for the second semester in a row. last semester i did alright  but i found his presentations recycled for this class which was helpful. he was always around for extra help and he wrote RIGHT back for emails. seriously. reading and homework is extensive  but you only meet once a week. very useful. kind and funny! take him if you can :)
5,I love Prof. Rose!! If you are majoring in Communication  you have to take at least one class with him! He gives a lot of work  but you'll learn a lot. As long as you put a little effort in  you'll do well! He is lightning fast with responses. If you send him a paper he'll get it back to you in like 10 minutes. Insane.
4.5,This man will reply to your e-mail in less than 5 mins. i swear! Very hard for intro to media industries much easier for internship seminar. in all  fantastic professor  super passionate about what he teaches. by far  the most useful class i have taken at fordham
4,He gives a lot of work! HW assignments are only 5% of the grade but there are like 16 of them in one semester!However  he is a fantastic professor who encourages students to be both analytical and critical about the media industries today. Very engaging lecturer. Never a dull moment. Midterm & final are LONG and really overwhelming. You learn a lot
1.5,More than a little self impressed. Asks obscure questions.
5,The KING of mass comm. anyone who hopes to have a career in the media industries NEEDS to take his class.
4.5,professor rose was great. his intro to media class was fun and i actually looked forward to it. he does give a lot of work  but some of it is not that bad. gives quizes which are not that fun  and tests are alot of writting. Rose is a very helpful professor and cares that you do good in his class. Take him if you want to learn and have fun.
5,I really enjoyed every class I had with him
5,One of the best professors at FU. Not only is he a media god  but he's friendly and eager to help individual students as well. Classes with him are actually FUN  esp. the smaller classes  and many of his students sign up for the courses he teaches just because he's teaching them. Makes you work  but all the info's valuable. Has taught media execs.
4.5,Took him for Internship Seminar. You can tell he's a good professor but he gives way too much work for interns who are already slaving away  giving 20+ hours a week to a course where they are getting 4 credits. Too much busy-work and writing that means nothing for a class that is pass/fail.
4,He is a great professor. The material covered is worth knowing. He is not an easy grader  but he puhes you to get a better grade. He is very funny  and keeps you awake. You'll have such a good time learning you would wish the class endured 3hr class. That's how good he was. Take him  take him  take him and oh yeah TAKE HIM!!!!!
4.5,tries to cover way too much material  but is understanding and kind.
1,The class and lab isn't bad  especially if you are interested in environmental geochemistry. It is actually very interesting. The problem is her... She is very snappy. She doesn't teach things right or give proper instructions on labs  but then snaps at you for not knowing it!
4,Dr. Donahoe is very passionate about her work  which makes the class so much better. The homework assignments are through pearson  so they can be kind of difficult. The quizzes are online  but pretty easy. There are 3 tests and a final  not cumulative  and she drops the lowest score of each category. The only thing I didn't like were the labs.
4,I love Geo and I think this was an amazing class. She posts the notes online  but go to class  will sometimes have clicker questions for attendance. The lab is easy  and the tests are long but easy. I would recommend her and this class.
5,Simple class  very interesting material in my opinion. Stuff I never knew before but could help me later in life. Good to get a science credit. Has reviews outside of class before the tests  go. Also read the textbook chapters. I averaged a B on all the tests but with the lab grade and all the help she gives you  I made an easy A.
1,ABSOLUTE WORST PROFESSOR I have had after 3 years at Alabama. Her class is boring  you don't learn anything  and her tests don't cover material she puts on her powerpoints. She is so unhelpful and not understanding to anything at all. DO NOT take her!!
2,She gives weekly homeworks and if you want a good grade on it  you have to go see her every single week for help. She makes the tests too long to finish. Test and homework out of sync with lectures. Seems uptight and a little snarky. Don't take it unless you absolutely have to.
1,Horrible class. Nothing was clear  and Donahoe was very unhelpful. If you want an easy science  do NOT take this class.
1.5,This is a course she made up herself. I have honors 200 level and above classes that are easier than this. She doesn't use the book she makes you buy and the tests  homework  and quizzes are HARD! She almost constantly goes over the time were supposed to get out and then gets mad when we leave.DONT TAKE THIS LADY! Unless youre a geologist i guess
4,Very good class. Clicker quizzes are useless as far as grading but it does count towards the attendance. This is a great course to take if you need a science credit. She gives good study guides and the online quizzes will benefit you significantly. Also  the lab required for this class is very interesting. Overall the best class I had in the Spring
3,It was an ok class. The clicker quizzes are useless  and she puts everything online  so you don't have to show up. You can tell she tries to be non-biased  but she doesn't succeed. She averages one attack on the Bush administration per week. Overall  it's an ok class  just incredibly boring.
2.5,By and large  this was the worst class I have ever been in. All she does is read what's on the powerpoint
1,Rona Donahoe is flawless. She has two Fendi purses and a silver Lexus. I hear her hair's insured for $10 000. I hear she does car commercials.r In Japan. Her favorite movie is Varsity Blues. One time  she met John Stamos on a plane. And he told her she was pretty. One time  she punched me in the face. It was awesome. No  really though  she sucks :/
2,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! this class is for non-majors... but you wouldnt think so if you attend any of her lectures. there are only 3 tests including the final and some of the information is not in the powerpoints she puts online! she's also quite boring and loves to turn the A/C on freezing to the point where you can't pay attention
1,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. it is extremely boring  and attendance is mandantory. She will bore you to death. and the test are hard  no matter what you study.
4.5,This class isn't hard  but you can't get behind in the reading. The tests are pretty difficult so just study hard and you'll be fine.
4,looks like Dianne from Cheers and has about the same personality
4.5,in this intro to environmental geology  she did a great job of using different media to teach and covered the basics on a wide variety of material. I learned a lot.
4.5,The material is straight forward just know it all!!
1,No Comments
4.5,Fantastic professor. Loved his teaching. Took documentary survey from him. He opened my eyes to the art of docs  which I didn't understand before the class. He makes you write  so be prepared for probably 3-5 decent length papers. He will grade semi-tough but it's worth it. Some of the docs aren't the most interesting  but are valuable nonetheless.
1.5,There is no feedback from him ever. I still haven't received any scores  am unsure about my grade and there is only one class left. He is not clear on his expectations and doesn't give much direction.
3,He gets off topic very easily and spends way too much time on something that should only take a few minutes. He does know a lot about his subject  but he gets so distracted and tells a lot of irrelevant stories. An okay class  but definitely not one of my favorites.
4.5,He's not there to be a babysitter. So if you work hard his guidance will be beneficial along the way.
3,Anyone who gets you excited and interested in what you are studying is a stellar professor! He's well spoken and has the best stories to tell. GO NOVA! Wish there were more professors like him.
4,.
4.5,Long answers to short questions. Funny guy  very very helpful.
2.5,A burnout.
1,Thinks he is better than you. Face it  he made a movie a long time ago  so he is. He will remind you that if you forget to bow. Stupid class because they stifle creativity to meet antiquated equipment standards.
4,An Awesome class! I loved taking it

5,Makes you think outside the box  one of the greatest teachers period.

5,Mr. Delgado is a great instructor. Very funny and comical.
4,He is a great teacher with a great sense of humor. He makes the class very interesting. If you need help he is always willing to listen and help you as much as possible. I recommend his class to anyone who likes to have learn and have fun at the same time.
1,What a jerk! How did he get his degree? Where is it from  Wal-Mart? This man is a FOOL!!!
5,Delgado is a easy teacher just as long you do your work.His test may seem a little long but if you study you should be able to pass easily. He has the abilty to make all his student feel at ease. Very funny  and out of 10 I would rate his bottom a 7 (pinch!!!!) thanks you Jesse
4.5,Mr. Delgado has been a terrific counselor  not only is he a counselor but a friend. He is someone who has dedication  motivation  and will always give you something to laugh about. Thanks Jesse for a great 2 years  you made college life a whole lot easier
5,Mr. Delgado is a wonderful teacher. He is very down to earth and willing to work with his students. You just have to show you want to learn.
5,He is the best professor I have ever had! He has so much energy so it doesn't matter if you take him in the morning or at night he will keep you awake. Take notes in class  participate and attend class you should be fine.
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE best prof at middlesex county college. Hated history before i took him. Attend class and participate and you will get an A
5,simply the best
5,incredible professor! funny  sweet  and interesting. i admired him so much we were friends outside of the classroom. he doesn't belittle students  but he demands attention. it's about respect. he needs to do his job  you need to earn your grade with knowledge. my favorite professor in my 6 years of college. would love to get in contact w/ him again
5,!!!
5,great teacher. you will learn more in his class in one semester. than any other history class available. i highly advise to take his class
5,HE IS INCREDIBLE  HE TEACHES U THROUGH THE DRAMA HE CREATES AND THEN WITH HIS INCREDIBLE OBSERVATION AND KNOWLEDGE ABT HIST. HE MAKE YOU INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT AND EVERYONE PASS HIS CLASS :p
5,Best professor I have ever had! He made me interested in things I didn't think I cared about. He changed the way I looked at education. Anyone have his e-mail?
5,Absolutely hysterical. I was in stitches every morning. Incredibly intelligent - his mind is always working. Nothing gets past him! Where is he now??? Would love to take another class with him.

5,AND THE GREATEST TEACHER CCC EVER HAS HAS GONE! WHAT A TRAGEDY  WHAT A LOSS. WE LOVE YOU MR. CONSTINTINO...........
5,He is thee hotterst teacher in the face of the whole world. He love his job and that make it easier for the students to learned. I can not imagine learning much from somoeone eilse then him. Its hard to believed that he is not working at CCC. The students can really use him too.
4,I once saw him swallow door handle. He has the strength of nine men  and can rend armies asunder with the boom of his voice. He also knows a thing or two about Charlemagne.
5,I had no interest in history until i had him. i hear he is teaching at stockton(which is where i go now) i will go out of my way to take him again even if i dont get credit for it. I dont know who CCC thinks they are for not hiring him as a professor.
5,The single greatest teacher on the face of the Earth. The heavens opened up and deposited him in South Jersey of all places. The most important resource that New Jersey has  the east coast for that matter. Check that  the world! If you prick him he does not bleed  he is a demi-god of history.
5,Dr. Cos  what the heck happened to all the rest of you. It seems that all the good teachers have dissapeared and left us with brainless and boring professors! For goodness sake John get on the horn and do something about it! Cheers -Franco
5,I love Dr. Constantino. He's the best professor. I laugh in his class but i also learn. Normally i can't wait for a class to be over. He always keeps you awake and alert. I can't believe he won professor of the year and ccc didn't hire him! Good choice.
5,he is the GREATEST teacher he has such a passion for teaching! Cumberland county stinks for not hiring him  I am taking my dads money else where! P.S. he has a nice arse. I wanna touch it
5,Interesting. Brilliant. Caring. Amazing Professor. (and extremely hot).
5,Talhammmmm  my man!!! What a gem of a professor! I had him for inorganic chemistry and it was one of my favorite classes! Sure  inorganic chemistry can be hard  but this man made it worth reading the textbook  looking over his notes  and studying for the exams. He truly made this class enjoyable. His exams are VERY fair  so worth it!!
5,Amazing professor. Cares about his students. The class is not easy  yet it is doable to get a good grade. Requires lots of time and effort. Professor is helpful in office hours and makes the infomation clear and easy to understand. Be careful of careless mistakes. Class is interesting and challenging.
5,Currently enrolled in his Inorganic course and he is absolutely amazing. Yes  you will need to study. Yes  the exams can be a bit tricky. It's all about the time you put into studying. He's a great lecturer and you should focus on studying the hw (not graded) he assigns. He's very helpful during office hours as well. 10/10
5,Dr. Talham is the best professor I have had at UF. Had him for Chem 2. If you expect an easy A then don't take him. He will make you work for your grade  but be fair in doing so. Acknowledging that his class was hard  he changed the grading scale to about an 84 being an A. The downside is that he travels  but that is expected for a tenured prof.
2,Not helpful at all. He left on two trips during the semester and did not care at all. Study edge and his class notes barely helped either.
4,Talham went to chemistry seminars around the world  in his absence the TA would take over the course. The TA sucked at lecturing. Talhams lectures are very interesting though. He doesn't use power points. I finished with an 83  which is an A. One Important thing
5,he is a great professor and seems very cool
4,Talham is a great guy  but thinks we are geniuses. He made the final very hard but because the average was pretty low  he changed the grade scale to help us out a bit  I had an 82 which was an A- in his class  so yes its hard but the scale makes up for it. I studied so hard for each exam but every exam was very difficult  and he covered more topics
3,Dan took the last two weeks of the semester off when material was taught (by TAs) that would make up 35% of the final exam. Tests were hard. Study at least a week in advance and read the text book. He is not a horrible man or teacher  hes just harder than other professors.. (he covered two more chapters than the other chem 2 class.)
4,Dr. Talham was a great lecturer  and very kind. Unfortunately  he hasn't taught for 10+ years  so none of his practice exams were up-to-date. He assigns lots of optional reading and h/w problems  but you don't have to do them if you use Study Edge. Being horrible at chemistry  SE saved my grade w/their awesome review sessions and practice problems.
1,Avoid Talham at all costs he is an extremely uninvolved professor. I believe that he does care about chemistry and teaching  however  he has not displayed that this semester. His exams had nit-picky details and he went at a considerably faster pace than all the other teachers for this course. The only practice exams provided were over 10 years old
1,I would never take Dr. Talham again. Was out of town the two weeks before out first exam and the week before finals. Tests are very hard and he gives practice exams from 1993 and 2000 which are not helpful. Would recommend anyone else. Yeah hes a nice guy but thats about it. Would not recommend.
4,Very knowledgeable teacher. His tests are not easy  but they are only of material covered in class and nothing new or tricky. Knows the answer to all questions and is very nice and respectful. Can get an A  but you must work for it and study for the test a day or two in advanced. Fair teacher and very good balance of material learned vs. difficulty
5,He is a super nice guy and want the best for his class. That being said if you go to his Office hours he turns into a mean person and kinda judges you. But other than that he was awesome and would def recommend him.
5,Defiantly the best professor I've had for GEN chem. But the class is still hard. I got an A using Study Edge. They really help to explain and emphasize the most important things Talham goes over. 100% recommend going to the weekly review sessions with Study edge made a huge difference when it came to the exams.
5,I absolutely loved Dr. Talham! He was very clear in his lecturing and made sure to use real world examples to accompany the topic. If you ever have any questions  he is always willing to answer them. In terms of the exams  he was very fair with his exam questions and always willing to discuss them with you after the exam. Great lecturer!
4,Professor Talham is the best! He's a cool guy who knows how to make Chemistry interesting  and a hard class accessible to students. He presents the subject matter in a clear and concise manner and even hand writes the notes along with his students  so you never miss anything because the professor is going too fast. Would take again!
5,I loved his lecture style! It's frustrating when professors put up slides and expect you to just copy them down while talking fast. Dr. Talham put slides up AND wrote items down on the board AND explained as he went. Lots of great visual aids in class. He made a note to learn every student's name in class during Summer A. Kind guy  great lecturer
5,can i say great and best professor? best chem professor ever! always helping you out  explains everything as many times as you need  he makes sure you learn it. Amazing.... if any questions  go to office hours  he will definitely help you out  even if he is busy  he'll take some time to help you. AWESOME!!!!!
4.5,Great teacher who explained things very clearly. Sometimes gives a little too much info  but is overall the best chem teacher I've had.
3.5,Not my favorite prof. We spent a lot of time on things that seemed irrelevant or politically motivated (this was before the 2004 election). For some reason we watched a documentary of Woodstock discussing the bands  and of course to support the democratic party in the election we watched Bowling for Columbine.
3,Course had a lot to do with what I felt were exceptional issues and situations and not really having any practical purpose.
4,Had some days of fuzzy presentations but I would reccomend this course to non-majors who might have a interest in the subject w/o a great amount of detail.
4,Very open and well organized.
3.5,The guys love her. She is a pretty good  but not a great teacher.
4,She is a great Professor. Plus she has the physical features that we make sure that you come to class everyday. Last semester she came to class is a short skirt....OMG!!!
4,Good introductory course for CJ majors. She has a lot of experience with undergraduate students.
3.5,Sometimes vauge on grading process.
5,pretty easy class. she is very nice.
5,She is hot  funny  and I would love to....
3.5,If you get past her physical attributes you really learn something. Wow...what a novel concept!
5,I respect her for her intelligence and her ability to teach  not for her looks.
5,very hot
5,OMG!!! she is so hot!!!! she can arrest me any day!!!(Frisk them baby)
5,WOW!!!
4,Great course and additional materials are a great support.
4,Hard to concentrate on the business at hand.
3.5,she is very very hot and every once in a while i have to tell fred to calm down if you know what i mean!!!
4,she is really laid back and really hot. very trust worthy and she is hott
4.5,Good lookin smart girl.
2,It was VERY difficult to earn a good grade. She will write on the board notes that are verbatim to the book and won't explain it well at all (if she can  she sometimes refers to students for answers). The programs had me sitting in tutoring for hours on end. The review guides given are decent but very vague  overall avoid this prof if possible.
2,She cares about students but I wasn't fond of her teaching. She tended to misinterpret students questions so you'd get a long winded answer to a question you didn't ask. She took attendance but I didn't think lecture was necessary. Homework isn't graded  but preps you for quizzes.
4,She knows her stuff and is very helpful. CS lectures can be boring  so no surprise there. Learned a lot  but I wouldn't take her unless you are a major. Overall very personable and sweet! Would take again
1,Very ill prepared and scattered professor. Very often goes off on tangents that don't relate to the class. She does not explain even basic concepts in a way that everyone can understand  and instead writes definitions followed by a poor example. If you don't understand after that you're sol. First test had various students with grades below a 10%
1,I've had her for two semesters now. Her lectures consist of showing us various definitions and examples  but not really explaining them. I had to learn most things by religiously examining the textbook and watching videos online. Going to class always felt like a waste of time.  but it's required. Expect to be confused every class period.
1,"She doesn't really ""teach"" us. She ""shows"" us things. She doesn't explain how to use them in certain situations which makes her a poor professor. And she takes great joy in making the tests abnormally difficult."
1,The professor is a nightmare. I understand that the professor is merely to show you a path  then you go upon a journey to learn. But when that professor only gives you a hammer and some nails and expects you to build the titanic  that's when I can't respect her. TLDR: She gives you basics  but doesn't help you with anything else. Suicide For Grade
2,Don't take her if you have no prior experience with coding.
1,"Possibly the worse teacher I've ever had. Her lectures were scattered and confusing and often we ended up off topic. This class claims ""no prior programming experience"" however this did not feel like the case considering I felt constantly lost despite reading the book and never missing class. Not good for beginning programmers."
2,She is a tough grader. Tough to the point of being borderline unfair. Each project is 100% correct or 100% wrong. If you had an error  no matter how small  you would get a zero. Luckily  she lets you retry the homework you turned in  for a slightly reduced point total. Which you will do a lot.
4,She's not as bad as many students on here say she is. She lets you know exactly what is going to be in the tests in her study guides. She covers the important topics in class. I had a bit of knowledge in CS before taking this class  but the class would be just fine for someone who has no background in CS.
2,Although I'm not receiving a bad grade at the moment  I cannot deny that she is not the greatest of teachers. She skips over some things in class and her assignments occasionally will cover things she did not discuss. Make sure you go over her review guides and do the reading and the homework  otherwise you'll probably fail. Go to the tutors 1st.
3,She's fine. She straight up tells you that she takes pleasure in making questions so hard that people will get them wrong.
1,I think it says something that the positive reviews all have negative user reviews whilst negative reviews have positive user reviews. This professor is just awful. Stay away from this class. I recieved an A so I am not just complaining. Her teaching style is godawful. Many people drop out of the major cause of her. Awful role model.
5,All in all  a great professor. While her tests can get rather hard  she gives bonus points to make up for it  and even once gave us 25 bonus points on a 100 point test. There are only three tests and a final. If you work hard and put in the effort  you will easily get an A. She is willing to help you. The only way to fail her class is to be lazy.
4.5,"She tries her hardest to get every student an A. She gives bonus points. We had a 25% curve one time. There are only 4 test including the final. If you read the book  take notes in class  and go to her office hours  you'll get a HIGH ""A."" And I mean like 97% or 98%. She is always asking if we understand things and stops for questions every 5seconds"
5,I never met a teacher that truly cares for their students as much as her. She is always asking for feedback on how she is teaching and if she needs to go over something again. She teachers better than any teacher at Truman and she knows what she is talking about. People fail because they don't put in the work and don't tell her when they need help.
1,Dare-Halma for CS 180 is like shooting yourself in the foot if you A: Didn't take a CS class in highschool that went over basic things B: Can't make most of your time for the class. Her grading is very harsh  as your tests have a test review guide in which you MUST know EVERYTHING. If it correlates with anything  its on there. Bad For Beginners.
1,This was the worst. Her programs are long and the homework had no clarity at all from the textbook and her graders had to grade them without the answer key and grade a week after they are turned in along with getting the answer key. Her tests were long (coding part). She expects you to read alot from the book  but goes out of order.
1,Her programs take way too long  including the tests. Her test questions take way too long. Even if you go to her office hours and go over the test  she goes fast and doesn't help a lot. HW assignments were dumb because she has specific answers to them  and her tutors grade them without the answer key.
5,I took professor Usyk this summer for statistics and honestly can say that I grew and learned a lot during my time in her class. Her lectures are easy to follow and she explains things clearly. She is straightforward with her expectations. Yes  she expects a lot from her students but she also is willing to help if you put in the neccessary effort.
1.5,Worst handwriting ever looks like a child scribbled on the board. No very helpful. Major Bi...
4.5,LOVED HER. she was my favorite professor EVER
2,She was somewhat intimidating. She threw a girl out of class for having a tiny notebook on her desk which wasnt her math notebook. She yelled at another student for trying to follow along and looking in his math book. She is hard to follow along. Would not recommend her.
1,I dropped this class because I was failing. I couldn't understand her writing so I was copying out of the book. She pointed out to everyone in class that I was not paying attention. I received an F from her even though I dropped!!!!
1,Ms. Usyk was very difficult to work with. She was arrogant and not helpful. If you take her class  your pretty much on your own. Stay away.
5,I took her 7 week course  and to be honest  I was scared out of my mind on my first day with her. She's tough but she definitely knows what she's talking about. This was my second time in the course. The first time I withdrawled because I was failing  and the second time around I got an A! I recommend her for sure.
2,very livid about students talking during class. She seems like an ignorant person.. I would not take her if I was you.
4,Today was my first day with this teacher and I can already tell this course is going to be a tough one. She seems like a very nice lady but she expects a lot from her students. She doesn't have very good hand writing and she talks rather fast. All in all  I'm a little nervous as to how well I'm going to do!
1,Also  her handwriting is impossible to read  which causes her to repeat everything she writes down several times.
1.5,She is consistently 10-15 minutes late for class. If you miss a class for any reason  including death in the family  even if you let her know ahead of time that you will be absent  you will get a zero for the work you missed. She does not allow any make ups and has really screwed some of her students over.
3,This teacher really knows what she is talking about. Once you get into the college level classes  she moves rather quickly. Try to get as much as you can out of her lectures. She doesn't like repeating herself  but will answer any questions that you have. If you are having any trouble  she is always willing to e-mail her students back. She's sweet!
4.5,Teacher was VERY helpful and made everything very understandable. In highschool I got a low D in algebra. In her class I got a 98 for the semester.
4.5,Ms. Usyk is a wonderful teacher. Whenever you do not understand any work  she is more than willing to stay after class to help you to understand what she is teaching. she is a very nice person.
1,awful. lowered by GPA so much. do not take.
4.5,Professor Usyk is great. I had her for Cells and Molecules lab at Stockton. She's very relaxed in lab and makes class fun. I would take her for lecture if I could. She explains the intros very clearly and teaching is so natural for her. Tests seem hard but you have to put in the effort and study everything. If you know the material  you'll be fine.
2.5,I did not like her as a professor. She was terribly boring and moved way too fast. I was too busy writing her notes that I did not have time to process what she was saying. I can honestly say I felt sad when I knew I was going to her class.
1,I took Professor Usyk as my lab professor at Stockton College and she was horrible. She doesn't care about her students  doesn't teach in class or help with labs. She gives really tough quizzes and doesn't give you a grade until after the semester is over. Do NOT take her  whatever you do.
3.5,I didn't like her as a teacher. Her lectures were horrible and you could tell she had no interest in teaching anatomy... As a person though  she's hysterical. I loved her dry sense of humor
5,No Comments
5,Ms. Usyk is a wonderful teacher. I had a self-paced course and she was always willing to help you anytime you need to. She is also a very nice person.
1,"He pretty much expects you to go to class  as he often covers important concepts at the beginning of class which he ""forgets"" to record. His test questions are written in a very convoluted way  which makes his test questions harder. His explanations in class are often garbage so you will need often learn things on your own outside of class."
1,Terrible at explaining key concepts. Makes uncomfortable and inappropriate sexual jokes  or at least did for my classes. Nice dude though.
5,Great teacher who clarifies any questions.
4,Amazing prof! Cares about the students and really wants you to do well! His lecture notes are really confusing but I think he is hoping people will make use of your textbook! He really knows what he is talking about  he is a very smart man. I relied on my textbook a lot  to the extent that going to class probably wasn't necessary.
4.5,Really great guy  will go great lengths to help you understand  and truly seems to enjoy teaching. My only gripe is that if you zone out for three seconds  you will be entirely lost in his lectures. Further  his notes are not exactly the best to study from  but I know he means the best.
3,Funny guy  tries to make class enjoyable but really his exam questions are much more tricky than one would anticipate just from going to lectures. He's pretty good at explaining things though  and uses iclicker questions similiar in format (not difficulty-wise) to those found on exams
5,One of my favourite professors in 12 years of university! Grills you like crazy but it's to make you a better Nurse and ensure you provide excellent and knowledgible care to your patients. Excellent course. Great Prof. Will always remember the striking difference between ionized and unionized molecules!!!
4.5,Definitely an acquired taste. Overall  one of my favourite professors in 12 years of university! Grills you like crazy but it's to make you a better Nurse and ensure you provide excellent and knowledgible care to your patients. Killer course. Great Prof. Will always remember the striking difference between ionized and unionized molecules!!!
3,Definitely a prof who cares about the students (consults with us about extra tutorial times  etc). Notes can be confusing but reading the textbook helps a LOT. Seems like a good guy who loves what he does.
3,Baer is baer... Once you've acquired a taste for his VERY SPECIFIC exam questions  you understand what you will be asked in the future. It seems like he loves what he's doing  which is a plus. You love him or you hate him.
1.5,Not a very good prof. His notes are VERY confusing and all over the place. Definitely preferred the other profs. Plus his exam questions weren't straight forward at all - very tricky.
3,The guy obviously knows and loves this material..but as a person  he was just annoying and not funny. But overall  it's possible to do well. Just study...alot....
1,Very confusing  boring lectures
4,"Some tricky exam q's  and some lies! (""You don't need to know numbers."" First question: What is the osmolarity of the tubules of the kidney?) Knew his stuff  but too fast for someone who doesn't provide overheads. Hated the material  but that's me."
4.5,he was very nice  and definitely helpful  and his sense of humour really grows on you...he was overbearing during the male reproductive unit  but otherwise pretty good...his exams are brutal though
3.5,didn't appreciate his jokes  so annoying. Definitely didn't like his material either  was counting down the days til new prof. Definitely knew his material though and was clear.
5,He is very nice. Very helpful both outside and inside class. He makes sure that everyone understood the material.
1.5,He assumes a position of intelligence  but lacks the acting skills to see it through...tragically  he is not aware of this.
3,not as funny as Dr. Easteal. The class is super boring.
3.5,No Comments

1,He's the absolute worse. Would not recommend taking. I know I won't think twice about taking him. He's very ignorant  rude and the worse. If you have the option to take him  DON'T
5,I've taken both Dr. Baers' Education Psychology and online creativity courses. Education Psychology is fairly hard  but the online creativity course was easy  very light homework and no tests. He's a nice man who cares about his students and what he's teaching. Talks a little fast sometimes.
3.5,Professor Baer is a great teacher! He enjoys lectures and tends to mumble or speak fast  but always makes sure that you understand before moving on. He enjoys teamwork and has teams work for points. Tests are all multiple choice  but they are not super easy. You definitely need to review notes before tests. I would absolutely take him again!
3.5,Loved Professor Baer  lectures were a little boring but always tried to make it interesting and hands-on by including small group-work. Gives lot of hand outs  and you do not need to read all of them. Tests are difficult  use Quizlet and books to your advantage. I would definitely take him again!
5,I worked hard but learned a lot.. Hes a very nice man.
3,He is a nice man but his lectures are long and confusing. You have to read the textbook otherwise you won't really know what is happening. Make sure to study really hard. He doesn't really like for you to ask questions  but as long as you study and try to pay attention you should be fine.
3.5,Expects SO much for an online 1 credit course. The articles were hard studies to read and write reviews on. His feedback was a little harsh.
4.5,I really enjoyed Dr. Baer's class. The choice he gives for exams is fair with different students teaching styles. He's a very friendly guy when visiting in the field and very approachable after class or during office hours. Sometimes it was hard to hear him during class  but he was willing to repeat any missed directions and speak up if asked to.
5,Dr. Baer was great1 I loved the choice he gave when it came to which type of exam you'd prefer to take. I'm also going to take his online class again this fall =)
5,Interesting  wants everyone to succeed  nice guy  sort of grandfatherly. Seems to really like students and teaching.
3,I have no idea how anyone could give this guy a good rating. His midterm and final were ridiculous! He makes you look over 86 words and 30 essays when only 15 fill-ins and 3 essays would be on the test. Who can memorize that much information? Half the stuff he didn't even go over in class.
5,Anyone who says Dr. Baer isn't an awesome prrof obviously didn't care enough to study hard. Dr. Baer is probably the est education professor at Rider. I wish he taught more classes because I would love to take him again.
4.5,He's such a nice and caring man. He reminded me so much of a grandfather. His tests were a little hard  so make sure you study. He gives you different options for tests so you can choose what works best for you. His lectures were boring at times  but you feel bad not paying attention since he's so nice. I would definitely recommend him.
4.5,Excellent teacher  demanding but you learn alot.
5,Hard  but worth it if you want to learn to be a teacher.
4.5,A very nice man. A really good class  could get a little boring at times  but overall I would recommend him. As long as you read and do all the assignments you will be fine. He is also a big Disney and Harry Potter freak. He's a great guy
1.5,"He is absolutely ridiclious. He only grades you on tests  but assigns written work that only counts as ""participation"" His lectures are boring and his grading is really unfair. Avoid him at all costs."
4,He is extremely intelligent and tries to be fun and entertaining with his Mickey games and reviews for tests. He can be kind of boring during lectures  but what lectures aren't boring? He tries to balance it out with other fun activities. You really learn a lot in his class. you definitely need to work hard for good grades and be sure to study
5,He was a caring and a great professor. This professor went beyond the call of duty and gave us extra credit  different test methods and was a professor who had great clarity and great knowledge of what he was teaching. He really loves what he does and shows it in his teaching.
5,He was an excellent professor who was willing to help and gave us great tools on how to be successful teachers. He was willing to go beyohd the extra mile to help us.
5,Cumpton is the like the cool neighborhood grandma that gives advice and always has cookies. If you take a night class with her  you can always expect cookies and she tries to fill the class time with fun and interesting things to do.
5,She is one of the most amazing teachers you could have. Sweet  caring  and genuine. She really loves what she teaches and it shows! She makes English/Literature fun and is just a pleasure to have as a teacher!
5,This woman will inspire you to be the best you can be. She brings life to everything she teaches. A true blessing to any student that is fortunate to cross her path.
5,Mrs. Cumpton is the best! She's elegant & classy  extremely competent  & has the sweetest disposition. She's so open to questions & help. I love English  so I loved the class and found it easy  but she challenges you for better writing
5,Mrs. Cumpton is an excellent teacher  very classy  has a great presence and she is one of the best teachers I had while at ILIS.
5,She was such a sweet instructor! I loved her classes! She was always so happy to see you in class! She brought out better writing skills from me. Pam was a good natured woman with a heart of gold!
5,She's just great. Gotta love those old school women who were hippies and burned their bra's for us ladies of today.
5,EXCELLENT!! Now she is what an English teacher is SUPPOSED to be! I've never learned so much in that short amount of time. I gained a lot of knowledge from her class  and it will stick with me always. She's very nice  but very fair. Wonderful  wonderful...
4,Wow  what a teacher! Cumpton makes English fun again. Yeah  you still have to write  but the assignments for both classes are simple and clear and she allows you to turn in writtings again.
5,No Comments
5,She's a very nice lady and she's a great teacher.
4,Helped me improve my writting skills.
4.5,Class was alright for english 101. She made it very entertaining and improved my writting skills
4.5,lets you return in assignments
5,No Comments
5,She is an awesome! She is so dedicated to music! She enjoys directing the chorale and that makes the class that much better and that much more interesting! My musical skills became so much better after I began taking her class!
5,I love Mrs. D! She's so nice and really knows her singing techniques. Join chorale :D
5,such a cute  nice lady! knows what she's doing and makes class really enjoyable. only one paper on pretty much anything music. also gave us christmas cards at the end of the semester. i love her!
5,Awesome lady  so much fun. Everyone should join!
5,Mrs. Dalrymple is a fantastic teacher and a great friend. She is always enthusiastic about choir and singing  and is a very hard-working professor
2.5,Overly- inflated ego  pointless in-class discussions  typos in HIS OWN book  and EXTREMELY HARD tests (way too complex for college-level material). Horrible teacher.
4.5,Dr. Harris is the most intelligent individual I've had the privilege of being in class with. I learned more in Com 450 and Com 225 than any other class. He is extremely friendly and extremely interesting. I enjoyed going to class!
4,Every class I have taken from this guy has been exactly the same. He is the laziest teacher I've ever had. Super friendly and funny  but constantly talks out of his a**.
5,He has got to be the best teacher I have ever had in my life. He is extremely knowledgeable. Really easy to get along with and he grades extremely fair. Awsome guy and should be the teacher of the year.
5,what an awesome class ... what an awesome professor
4,you read you're ok. he doesnt lecture to much...but it's still fun.
5,all you got to do is read
4,all you have to do is read
5,He knows his statistics. Tests are always multiple choice  and reading is a must. This guy will help you out with ANY real world info.
3,Very big ego. If you patronize him and stroke his pride you will do well. Make him look good at the ASHRAE competition and he will help you. If you challenge him he will lose his temper and his ears turn red. Smart but totally vain.
5,His teaching methods are not normal. He would yell at you and tell you that you did it wrong  but on the other hand he would gladly help you correct your issues and understand what you were doing wrong. He would even come in on Saturdays to help his students learn and make sure projects were done on time. Great prof and helps with real world sits
1.5,"This professor is very unprofessional. He responds to every question as if the student is questioning his intelligence. Enjoys talking down to students. Uses the term ""creativity"" as a grading parameter to take points away for no apparent reason. He also likes to use double negative statements on exams to purposefully confuse students."
1,Textbook narcissist that simply should not be a teacher. Hot-tempered  drops f-bombs  and attacks and belittles students who ask questions. You will have to find a way to let his racial comments  cursing and talking to people like they're mentally handicapped not bother you  just so you can pay attention in lecture. He's very childish  really.
1,Subjective and opinionated. Not a good teacher. If every student in the whole program gets a terrible score on a lab assignment  do you think it may have something to do with the clarity of the instructions? NEVER admits when he is wrong  and he enjoys messing with your future by lowering your GPA. Hopefully you have a different teacher for 362.
4,Very knowledgeable but it seems like he doesn't care too much about students success. He pics favorites in class so its helpful to be part of Ashrae and other student groups. Not very approachable  if you don't understand something and ask a question he will sometimes talk down to you. Watch for his BPM (blinks per minute).
2,"Stickler for silly stuff. His heart is in the right place overall but he will waste your time on report format so make sure you follow the format he lays out to a ""T"". Can be testee and short for not apparant reason. Very knowledgeable but a bore to listen too! OMG he can put you to sleep! :)"
3.5,Great Class  Loads of Information So get organized! Lots of Formulas so brush up on some algebra... Just do your work on time & attend every class. Feel free atr ask for help  Zentz prefers people to get help ahead of time  out of class. You will learn alot in this course so dont get behind. Good Luck
2,He is a horrible grader. He hates to give out A's in anything. He will purposefully mark you off big points for little problems in your assignments. If you ask him questions he will get mad and start yelling. On the plus side he seems to know the information.
3,This class is very demanding but you can learn alot. Also gets reall annoying when professors think thier way is better than anything else you have ever learned and he needs to realize not everyone sees the world the same as him.
4,good but demands you work to get a good grade
5,Get organized and stay organized! Very good instructor. VERY knowledgable. Assignments pile up quick  but there is always plenty of lead time. Procrastinate and you will BURN! Very demanding instructor  but hard work is acknowledged and rewarded. Opportunities are provided for extra credit.Good luck!!!
2.5,Don't know what all of this business about easy grading is. He is the most critical grader I have ever seen. Way too much stuff to do in the class. He piled everything on at the end. It is not a good class and he is not a fair teacher.
2.5,Homework  labs and other work not handed back very quickly. can be a a*# some days  and always thinks everything he does is the right way.
4,This is a class with a lot of formulas involved. Stay on top of your work and don't get behind or you will never catch up.
5,Great teacher  he really knows what he is talking about. He cares about his students success and their future. He just wants everyone to leave the HVAC program knowing what they need to know.
4.5,No Comments
3,Easy grader but lots of notes and gives too much information
4,great guy!
2.5,New teacher. Can tell he has never taught before. Needs to slow down a lot. Pretty easy grader though.
4,Agree  you must read because she asks questions on the test about information not in the lecture. But she also asks about information in the lecture material. Interesting class. I learned a lot. Attendance not mandatory but you can get rewarded for good attendance.
1,Avoid at all cost. She lectures the entire class time and the majority of what she says isn't even what will be on the test. She talks more about her personal life and personal opinions than the material that we actually need to know. Her test are tough and without the book you will have no idea what is going on. This class is miserable.
4,GO TO CLASS! AT THE END OF THE SEMESTER SHE TOLD US SHE RESERVED THE RIGHT TO DROP YOU A LETTER GRADE FOR SKIPPING CLASS
4.5,My favorite class with my favorite professor. I like her teaching style. She tells lots of funny stories that relate to the class  and she really cares about her students.
1,The test are difficult. The instructor doesn't discuss anything that will really prepare you for the test she talks constantly about irrelevant topics. This is the first Hd class l've ever had that was this difficult when it shouldn't be  the information is not hard but you have to read in order to do well do not expect to learn in class
4,I really enjoyed her class. She knows what she is talking about. I did not take any tests in her class. It was all based on papers/chapter summaries. Basically put in some effort and go to class. I definitely think she will help the student if she knows them and they show effort.
4.5,This was a great course. The exams were hard b/c they are: pick only one  pick A & C  pick A C&D  pick all of the above  none of the above. Extremely tricky. Know your stuff in this class. She gives many personal anecdotes in her lectures to bring the points home. Very impressive.
5,I had Dr. Curtner-Smith for HD 382: Parent and Family Development last fall. It was my favorite class. We learned so much  and the stories she tells about her family relate to what she is teaching. I loved this class and will use the information I learned when I become a parent.
2,I had her for an online class this summer and the only grades I received before the class was over were the test grades  which are generated automatically. She made you have the tests proctored which was just a pain. She was slow at responding to e-mails too  which is very important for an online class. Don't expect to know your grades!
2,I took her in the May summer semester and did not receive a grade on a paper or anything until August 9. You never know what your grade is or where you stand. Not to mention she asks questions on tests youve never heard. Talks too much about her own life and not the course material.
2.5,You might as well throw out the syllabus because she spent so much time talking about her life that we made it through about the first four lectures. She's obviously intelligent  but she never stays on topic so you don't learn anything. She covers NOTHING from the book but expects you to know it (her actual words). And tests very  very hard.
2.5,She is an OK teacher. Her class seems VERY long and she talks WAYY too much about her family. Most of which has NOTHING to do with the material we are covering in class. Her tests come from power points that you must be in class to get and you also have to read ALOT in your text book. She loves to TALK and shows alot of movies.
3.5,I had Dr. Curtner-Smith for 480 and now for 483. She is very nice and helpful but her classes are extremely time consuming. They should definitely count more than 3 credit hours! She knows her stuff though and you will definitely learn from her.
5,I learned a ton of useful info in this class and found it really interesting. Her examples help you remember the information  and the stuff you learn actually applies to real life. Very helpful professor.
2,HARD TESTS! She was crazy about attendance and then at the end of the semester it didn't count against you if you were there or not. Awful class.
1.5,Dr. Curtner Smith is an intelligent woman  but I did not like her as a professor. She is very confusing as far as assignments and test material goes  and is not an effective communicator at all. She talks about her family for 90% of class time  and hardly gives any useful information in way of tests  etc. Her class is NOT easy!
1,"I dread going to this class. Ms Curtner Smith is an annoying communicator by the way she stutters through statements and says ""Um"" alot. She tends to teach more towards those with Psychology backgrounds- if you do not have one then you probably wont know what she is talking about and she doesn't explain it either. Very boring teacher do not take!"
1,Very hard and boring!I dread going to this class every single day. It takes her a week to post grades. And all the tests are scantron. Do not take this class if you don't have to. The class is miserable and I don't know anyone who likes going to it. She always goes off subject  and keeps you the full time. AWFUL CLASS AND AWFUL TEACHER.
4,I learned so much in her classes. She's so helpful outside of class. We've kept in touch since i had her a few years ago and she's helped me out alot. I do agree that she's all about attachment parenting.
5,She is a very nice person  and she is very knowledgable in the field. I liked when she lectured and gave us notes  but she did not really talk about anything in the book because we were expected to do that on our own. But  the BOOK IS AWFUL! Dont wait to read until the last min.
1,While I do find that college life explicitly involves freedom of expression  I do not think Professor Hancock's encouragement of vulgarity among students outside of class is appropriate or professional. I'm glad I transferred to Penn State
4.5,You will learn a lot.
5,My boy. Great teacher
4.5,Prof. Hancock is one of the best professors at Gburg! He's super helpful  his class was interesting and engaging  and he's pretty funny. He makes you read a lot but it's totally worth it. It's obvious that he loves what he teaches and cares about his students. Well the ones that pay attention. Oh! And his 1 page papers are the best!
2,Lost assigments  lots of pop quizes. Arbitary participation garde. Difficult to deal with. Missed first class of the semester
4.5,One of my favorite professors. I recommend him to all history majors (and non).
3,it's a good thing FYS 114/3 is no longer being offered because it was awful! He was so unclear and never taught. It was like he didn't even care. He worked with a professor that he hated.
5,Loved the class and gained a wealth of knowledge. Sad that there aren't more professors on this campus like him.
5,He was such an amazing professor. I learned sooo much from his classes. He is in touch with our generation and a lot of fun. I thought he was cute  too! He is an amazingly smart historian who values discussion in class.
4,Hes a samrt dude who learns from the kids in class as he teaches them.. In touch with kids our age. Knows whatsup.
3.5,No Comments
4.5,Hands down the most serious and hardworking profs around. He's a machine  smart as a whip
1.5,I generally love all my teachers because I check them on here. This teacher  however  was extremely inappropriate. He made jokes about handicapped kids the first day. He spent at least two months looking at uncovered people  mostly women and even admitted to going to an adult site for some of his material. Won't take again.
4,"Take this professor if you get the chance. This course is an easy ""A"" and at the same time you really learn a lot. This Professor teaches in a way of his own and it is a course that I will never forget. I drove from Pensacola Beach to Milton just to take this class and it was worth every mile! Professor Wolf loves his job and it shows!"
5,Dr. Wolf is the best teacher I have had this semester at PSC. His lectures are always so interesting. He encourages you to be bold  say what you feel  and have an opinion. He is so smart funny and awesome. I will take him whenever I can in my other classes. Don't buy a book  the class is mostly just class discussions. ENJOY :)
3.5,I took Contemporary Literature with him  and I'll say it was very thought-provoking. Honestly  never knew what topics we were going to cover in class  but the debates and subjects we went over were entertaining. Keep an open mind in his class and don't be too sensitive to some of the things he brings up. Overall  very interesting class.
5,Best instructor I have ever had the privilege to sit in a classroom with. I leave the country for the next three years and one of the things im doing my last two days in America is sitting in on his class. Take him if you can.
5,Dr. Wolf is the bomb. He just says stuff to see if he can get a rise out of students and open their minds uto alternate ways of thinking
3,Wolfe is the EASIEST teacher in the world! Fun class learn a lot but very easy just come to class. And dont buy a book!
4,Amazing teacher  I believe his goal is to open your eyes and teach you how to want to learn  rather than making you know unimportant dates and names  but rather the reason behind things. Be at class  listen  participate  and enjoy.
5,DEFINITELY AN EYE OPENER  NEED TO BE OPEN MINDED. HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO TAKE HIS CLASS. HE LOVES TO HEAR STUDENTS THOUGHTS.
4,Interesting professor and class  not for the easily offended. Come to class  do as he ask  participate in class and you will get an A. He treats you like college students  not like high school students. Loved his class.
3.5,Don't think you have him figured out the first day. He is sly  like a fox. He is very good at getting you out of your comfort zone. Be open minded and enjoy the class. He is extremly educated and wants us to be also. I recommend him.
5,Hes a very funny teacher. Very humerous. But hes a great teacher. He gets to the point and as long as you pay attention easy A. He does help you out some but you have to attend class. If you miss to many days you will be dropped out.
5,"AWESOME AND CRAZY! He will say ANYTHING! Easy A. I think we only had one test besides the final. JUST COME TO CLASS! You have to write a 25 page journal but it is very easy because it can be about ANYTHING and I mean ANYTHING such as the pizza you at last night. Very caring personality. Likes to talk about ""Hot Dogs and Doughnuts"""
5,Dr. Wolf is hilarious! YOU HAVE TO TAKE HIM (unless you are easily offended). He says anything and does anything! He makes you keep a journal but besides that haven't done any literature lol. We've read ONE story so far.
5,Doctor Wolf really is an amazing professor. Doesn't force his opinions upon you  makes you write a journal (but very easy) uses powerpoint for the material  never uses the book  he likes participation. He's very funny  i enjoy going to his class. Has no shame at all. He's pretty descriptive haha. But a VERY good class. I recommend taking it.
4.5,Dr. Wolf is the best teacher I have ever taken. He is eccentric and well educated. He wants people to question the norm. The only professor so far to teach and respect me as an adult. If you are not open minded do not take this class. Take him!!Easy A!!
1,He's evil  very inappropriate
3.5,Really good guy. Dont go into this class talking and acting like an idiot  he will make you do stuff like come to the front of the class or make fun of you. This class is great though! Very Very Very knowledgable. You will learn so much if you pay attention. I recommend this teacher  hes a funny guy!
3,He is a good teacher  extremly knowledgable. If you are not a Christian Jesus loving Southern  he will make sure you know what a bad person you are. Very outspoken on religous views. (a bit innappropriate at times) But you will learn a lot from him. Easy A if he stays in a good mood through the semester.
4.5,"Great teacher! He knows how to keep your attention and he has a broad knowledge of art and its history. If you need Modern World History...you need Dr. Wolf. Do as he asks and you are guaranteed an ""A!"""
4,Open book tests  easy fun class
5,took both of his gangs classes. would love to take more. he's funny  easy  love his classes. must take this professor.
5,Had Barker for PLS 410 & CRJ 423 (Gangs). He was great. Both very easy classes. He is very knowledgeable in everything he teaches  and writes his own textbooks. Great professor and great dude. Really enjoyable classes!!
5,Great professor. Had two classes with him and he is super easy and interesting
4.5,My favorite teacher I have had at eku. I have took him for everything he teaches. He is a must take.
5,HE IS THE MAN! i have had him for every class he teaches and he is my favorite teacher at EKU. he is hilarious and very smart and has some great stories to tell
5,By far the best teacher I have ever had. He is a wealth of knowledge on law enforcement and makes even the most boring subject interesting. If you comment that his class is hard you must be braindead. If you go to class and pay attention  you will do very well. Wish he taught graduate classes!
5,The coolest Professor I have ever had.
5,Very realistic person and down to earth. Also is very knowledgable about the practical side of the Police and their studies. Very nice person and he makes the class easy to learn and take test. I would definitely recommend this guy.
5,Best instructor ever. I LOVED his biker gangs class... He knows his stuff. Got me really interested in this stuff
5,Maybe it was the subject matter (biker gangs)  but I really liked this class. My hand still hurts from all the notes  but in the end he decided not to give a test. Most of the videos killed me (and there were a lot of them)  but Dr. Barker's comments during them made me wake up occasionally. Entire grade was based on a book review and attendance.
4.5,The guys is fantastic. Really looking forward to his biker gangs class.
5,Very funny guy  always up for a laugh. Grades a little hard  but willing to help you out as best he can.
4.5,Was a very hard teacher  but very good. I learned a lot taking his class. He is a very good instructor and will work with you if you don't understand something.
4,No Comments
5,Had I had this instructor prior to my English classes  I would have done better on my papers.
4,His class can be very stressful  but he will work extensively with you!
5,If you dont pass with an A in this class then you did something wrong. Only thing you do all year is lectures and there are 3 test. If you get an A on the first two then you dont have to take the final test. HE GIVES YOU THE TEST AS A STUDY GUIDE  literally hands you the exact test just look over notes and power points.
5,Very laid back  and cancels class frequently. Weekly papers are easy  and no exams. Class isn't that bad (when you have it)
4,Chuck is a great professor  he frequently leaves the country so classes are sparse  and his grading sometimes can be questionable. If you do the assignments and answer the questions you'll get an A with no questions asked. He's a very respectable man and probably one of the nicest people you'll ever meet.
4,Took Chuck for my 101  301  and a winter course to Finland. He is an awesome professor  grades fairly  and cancels class often. If you get the chance take the Crime and Justice in Scandinavia with him  you will love it.
4,Easy class  just take notes and you'll be fine. Tests are usually opinion questions mostly. Textbook not mandatory but it helps.
5,Dr. Fields does lecture a lot but he tells stories to go along with it to keep your interest. There are almost no assignments in this class  but the tests are pretty tough. Even though there are only 3 tests  including the final  they are pretty much your entire grade. The textbook isn't mandatory  but it will help.
2,DO NOT TAKE HIS DRUGS & SOCIETY CLASS! Idk if the other reviewers were high when they wrote their review but he is a very difficult professor. His final and midterm were outrageously hard. If you miss more than 1 time he was start taking off letter grades. He also tells stories the entire class and it's very hard to stay awake.
4,I loved the class. He keeps it interesting and tells hilarious stories. He never uses the textbook in class or gives out assignments. If you listen and read the chapters  plus go over powerpoints  you should be fine.
2.5,I personally don't like him very much  his class is SO boring. I can't focus at all and pretended to throw up two different times just so I could leave. If his midterm wasn't take home I would have gotten a 0 because he can't teach. 20 page paper  presentation  midterm  final. Those are your grades.. don't screw any up!
4,Awesome  cancels class a lot  take home midterm  optional final
4.5,Chuck Fields is an awesome teacher! He will always keep your attention by his diverse stories that he shares. He does take attendance  and does give somewhat difficult tests. Make sure to read in the textbook for the test! Overall loved the class!
5,Awesome!
5,Chuck Fields is a very good professor to take for Drugs class. Very knowledgeable on illicit drugs and their history. Two short answer exams and 5 short reaction papers to movies you will watch in class. Focuses mainly on effects of drugs and also lots of history about government propaganda and media scares that have led to drug criminalization.
5,Dr. Fields is the man. Come to class and participate and you will do fine. I recommend this teacher to anyone beginning the Criminal Justice program.
5,Good teacher. wonderful person. i always had his drug class.
4,awesome teacher awesome guy if you get the chance take him for any class even if its not a CRJ
1.5,He is an ok teacher but needs an attitude ajustment
5,Excellent Teacher. Highly Reccommended! He outlines everything that is on the MidTerm/Final.
4,He's an awesome teacher who keeps you engaged in conversation. You rarely have homework. Just make sure you go to class.
3.5,He makes every class enjoyable. His stories and examples help me stay awake for his 8:00 class. As long as you go to class  you are more likely to pass.
4,Class is fine  all notes on his website. Very clear about class information  Very few test really easy just review notes and your fine. He is a great teacher but if you have no sense of humor and don't like cussing or jokes don't take him  but I find him to be just fine. I would recommend taking him for any class  I am again next semester.
3,Easy and informative classes  just keep up with the notes. He comes off as extremely pompous. Which he can be  but for the most part he is alright.
5,"Great teacher  there are no suprising or difficulty to the test! He is a smart ass  but thats what makes him cool  "" take a joke you sensitive losers!"" The information is up front and easy to learn. I reccomend for a fair and easy A"
1,He is a pompous A***ole. He is VERY RUDE! Try to avoid taking him if you can!
1.5,We did nothing but take notes. And he flipped through the overhead notes so fast few got them down. Tests based on notes. His basic level class had more work than advanced courses. The only save from notes was the current events first thing of class which we learned to prolong as much as possible.
3.5,Funny  bit of a smart @$$ though which can make him hard to approach. Worth taking.
4,This is what a good college prof should be like. He's personable  but professional. True you have to study for his tests hardcore  but there's no surprise as to what's on it. I appreciate that. He's hilarious in class and very approachable.
2,Didn't do a good job letting students know what he expected on exams.
1,This prof is full of himself. His class was boring and he's snubs students. Thinks he's hot but really he's not. Has an attitude that keeps us from asking questions. It's all about him after all.
1,"His class is VERY boring and I'm learning nothing I haven't learned in the past. He never answers questions after class  or even during class. He lectures the whole time  and his attitude changes when a ""special"" person is in the class."
4,cute babe!
5,Dr. Paulsen is a very easy to talk to  with a great sense of humor. The course itself was not that great  but I liked Dr. Paulsen a lot.
4.5,Dr. Paulsen  he is a great and funny teacher  he is easy to talk with  has a great sense of humor.
5,I took this class during the summer  and it was a breeze! There are three tests and a cumulative final. Dr. Williams is funny  enthusiastic  and always has a smile on her face. She gave us fifteen minute breaks between lecture and film presentations and allowed us to eat during the films. If you're looking to knock out a fine arts credit take her!!
5,Excellent teacher. Very chill. Many days were just casual discussions but always interesting. Easy A as long as you come to class and pay attention.
5,Dr Williams is great. I had no desire to take a film class  but needed the fa credit. It turned out to be a good class. It was a summer class and it was a lot to cover  but it was surprisingly easy. Dr Williams was very friendly  personable  and helpful. If you can take her I would highly recommend you do so.
4.5,Dr. Williams is awesome and made this class very fun and worthwhile. I was required to take this class and wasn't very interested in it  but Dr. Williams made it a great experience.
4.5,This was a pretty easy class  and Dr. Williams did a good job teaching it. Our class specifically had a really humorous dynamic  and I enjoyed going to this class more than any other class. My only complaint is that I wish Dr. Williams gave more specific feedback on our ad writing assignments  but as I've implied  this was a very easy/fun course.
5,Dr. Williams is extremely helpful and a fantastic Professor. She has great guest speakers from the professional world and has wonderful contacts in the Entertainment Industry. The most fantastic bonus is that she is so HOT!! You aren't going to find a better looking Professor :-)
5,I love Dr. Wiliams. Shes a great professor. Always willing to help you in anyway she can. She's the best!
5,Dr. Willimas is always helpful. She makes TCF fun. She's always willing to help in any way she can. You can even call her at home as long as you call before 11:30 pm. EXCELLENT PROFESSOR
5,Great Teacher! Loved having her as a professor!
5,A terrific professor! Very good looking!
4.5,Glenda's class was not that rough. It was mainly outside of class work and small projects. If you're okay with attendance mattering then you will do fine in this class.
5,No Comments
5,Great teacher!! Fun and knows her stuff. She was also a great advisor!
5,great professor. quick grader ... wants all of her students to well. explains things well and makes sure all her students understand. gives out her home phone number in case you ever have questions later that night. AWESOME CLASS AND PROFESSOR
1,nice  but shows favoritism
3.5,Glenda Williams is an adviser for the TCF department. She is not in on mondays and fridays  which is terrible! Even during registration she will be out of her office on those days. TCF department is severely slacking with this!
5,One of the best!!
4.5,Awesome prof. Took us on awesome field trips and inspired me to look into a career in geology. Really great guy and will be missed by the geography dept. SAVE DR. WELSCH!!!
4,Class is pretty boring  all we do is go over slide presenations. Tests are kinda hard.
5,GREAT TEACHER!! tells interesting stories  extremely enthusiastic about the geography and geology and wants his students to learn the information. Labs are easy and can mostly be done before hand. Does powerpoints that are simple and lots of pictures. Take him if you have this class!!
4.5,A great guy and a good teacher. You do not have to buy a book ($100) and he is always ready to help you out. BUT  turn your work in on time  He might deduct 20% A DAY from late work  but he will give you a break once in a while  just do not count on it. Learned alot and had fun as well
2,dont take this teacher...it's all powerpoint presentations and doesnt hold study sessions of any kind. Not very helpful and boring. Tells random stories.
5,He's kinda cute  and funny. He tells lots of random stories and made the class really fun. If you're going to take this class  take it with him!
5,Super easy teacher. I have him right now and got 95 on test and A's on all quizs.
5,He's a great professor
5,great teacher  has complete and firm grasp on geography and his class is very passable if you go to class and read the book. Recommend him to anyone of any intelligence level.
5,GREAT teacher  reaally interested in the course material. Test's are easy if you study. Watch out for bonus points  if you answer incorrectly it is counted aganist you
4,Work is not difficult  if you do the work then you will be fine.
1,SHES HORRIBLE!! HANDS DOWN. Don't take her class!!
1,Teacher very hard
1,AWFUL DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS! So hard to understand and never stays on track with anything! Worst teacher I have every had.
1,This is the most unorganized teacher i ever had. English is my favorite subject  i have never struggled with writing before until this class. She knows her facts  but has NO idea how to teach. She is not helpful and SOOOO hard to understand. The whole class is way behind and we do not even go by the sylabuss. She does not stay on track with anythin
1,AWFUL! Do not take her as a professor! The most unorganized professor I have had. I've never had any trouble in an english course and I am beyond lost this semester. Neumann has got to do something to fix this problem  after looking at previous comments it has been going on for a long time.
1.5,This woman is awful. I have liked every teacher I have had at Neumann  except for her. She is rude and unwilling to help  and she makes no sense whatsoever. The work is hard and she has no desire to help you through the class  I've tried numerous times. Bottom line- stay away from her classes if you can!
1.5,if you can help it DO NOT take her english class. she treats it like it's more that just a core class. way too much work for a gen. ed and she's rude. when i wrote a good paper she asked me if it was my own? basically did i plagiarize... avoid her/her class at all costs!!!
1,Without a doubt the absolute worst teacher in Neumann college. You cant understand her and she makes absolutely no sense
1,the worst teacher at neumann...could not understand her hand writing...not very organized...at one point in the semester she lost my classes papers....can never understand what she is saying...and probably the worst speaking voice of any teacher iv ever had
1,i dropped the class half way through the semester...absolutely horrible...DO NOT TAKE HER
4,Awesome professor  very organized
1,shes horrible I would never take her again
1.5,Very hard to understand and not very clear on anything she presents.
1,Anne what world are you in???????????
1,COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWN DONT TAKE HER YOULL BE IN A DAZE
1.5,No Comments
1.5,he went against UNH handbook guidelines by giving out personal information of students to non students
5,Great teacher  makes class interesting  and challenges students to argue their points. Fun class
5,Give yourself your own grade. Interesting method of grading but effective! Class was a round-table discussion and it is a definate break from the constant lectures. I highly recommend him!! Bring your cup of coffee and enjoy!
5,Best and easiest class ever taken
1,****...dumb but thinks he is smart...doesn't really know what he believes in?!?!?!
2,"Likes to tell people they are ""Misguided"" because they disagree with his view."
4.5,He is open to hearing any point of view  but if there is what he feels is a right one he will push you towards it. He has a story or the like to go with every topic  which is good and makes it easier to learn. And is not homophobic or pushes christiany.
4,"His grading method is very different  but it is very effective. It is a lot of work to get the grade you want  but there are no ""grades""  so there isn't as much pressure. I would suggest taking his class."
1,Horrible
5,No Comments
3.5,In his ethics class he really pushes peoples buttons to spur discussion. He is quite conservatice politicaly and occasionaly comes off as homophobic. Sometimes it seems as though he is pushing christianity onto the class. Overall his class is good.
5,Very good teacher makes class interesting.
5,His method of grading is different but effective. He is informative  and gets off topic easily which is partially good. If you do the work you are good for the semester.
1.5,No Comments
3,Ruhi can be intimidating when it comes to asking questions in class. It seems like he gets frustrated for you needing clarification. This class would have been a lot harder if I had not taken AP Stats in high school. Although  the examples he gives in class give a good insight to the tests. He always gives a formula sheet  too.
5,Teacher is passionate about what he teaches  very thorough and explains what is expected for the exams  assignments and homework.
1,He's smart but he's rude to his students. Very bad at explaining the concepts to students. Ask him for help? He'll act like you're wasting his time. If there's another option  take another teacher. You'll spend hours reading the textbook and watching youtube trying to teach yourself.
2,Seems to understand what he is doing  but is easily the worst teacher I've had at communicating what he is talking about to students. His lack of proficiency in English can be a challenge at times  although accent is clear. Can be incredibly rude at times  calling out students for not knowing answers.
2,Intelligent but bad at explaining material. Expect to teach yourself. Office hours always packed. He accuses you of skipping class and looks at you like your an idiot when you ask questions to clarify his confusing lectures. Only professor I've seen yell at a student or call them a liar. A is possible  B is likely  C is common. Drop rate is high.
2.5,Confuses me  gives good examples  I learn better from examples on hw then teacher himself
3.5,This is a difficult subject  but Ruhi does a good job of explaining the material. Exams are tough  but they are manageable. Discussions are graded. He does have an accent  but is definitely understandable. I would recommend this professor.
4,Ruhi is very nice and helpful but has quite an accent. He makes the exams easy enough. This class was Business Statistics. I took AP Statistics in high school  so it kinda helped with acing the class and the exams. He posts all his notes online. I only looked through the book (online) if I doubted anything on his slides. I recommend him
1,Bad.
5,Although this class is extremely tough  Prof. Ruhi works hard to teach his students well. His grading is very fair and he always responds to emails promptly  even on the weekends. As long as you attend lectures  you can do well in the course.
4,Awesome teacher. He gave plenty of examples and the class material built on itself very well. Provided review times before tests. I never did the homework but had no problems. (I am a bit of a math-oriented guy - 780M/650E/600W SAT  FWIW.) Only downside is you got to walk to Van Munching  on the outskirts of campus.
3.5,One of those classes that either clicks or doesn't. He's a nice guy whose willing to repeat things to you over and over  and his tests/quizzes are straighforward. Class isn't mandatory but he gives MAJOR hints on what to expect on tests and exams as well as help w/ the homework. Very possible A
5,One of the best professor i ever had to learn from.
4,Professor Ruhi was one of the best teachers I've ever had. He was always so helpful and nice. Dr. Ruhi really wants his students to learn the material.
4.5,A great teacher. He really DOES want students to do well. He has an accent  but honestly I can understand him better than any math teacher I've ever had. He's very logical. LISTEN to his advice and DO the HW.
5,One of the best math teachers I've ever had. He runs through the problems in a logical order  and the homework is really similar to the exams. As long as you do the homework problems  the exams and quizzes will be really easy.

4.5,He's the best!!! He gives 4 quizzes  midterm  final and two individual projects. Exams are not that hard as long as you study and do exactly what he tells you to do. He is an awesome teacher!!! 4 Quizzes will give you an idea what real exams look like. Take his class. You will have a great semester wit him!!!
5,Super nice guy who will do everything in his power to help you do well in class. DEFINITELY recommend him if you have the chance to take his class!

4.5,Nice guy  very high expectations though.
4,This guy knows he's smart. Seems to let you know too.
4,If it's important  he says it THREE TIMES. This can be annoying.
3.5,Very clear on his expectations  but not overly nice.
4,Okay so you're all being way too hard on her. Yeah she assigns a lot of reading but this is college. We're supposed to be learning  not getting grades for nothing. She has intriguing class discussions  grades fairly  gives helpful feedback  and she really knows her stuff.
3,I enjoyed this class. She grades you on your understanding of the material and you will actually learn history. She cares about the experiences of the people in the past and will help if you ask. There are no tests. She does assign a lot of readings but you just have to skim them. You just need a basic understanding of American history.
2,"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. If you want to pass any of your other classes you should not take her. She is so unclear and assigns so much work. If you ask a ""dumb"" question she laughs at you. Thinks everyone is stupid. Such a hard grader. Tried to give benefit of the doubt but she is horrible. Take my word..."

1.5,WORST TEACHER EVER!!! Grading comments - make no sense. classes = boring. VERY HARD - especially when it comes to grading papers assigned.
2,HORRIBLE. If you can change professors  then do it! She is so boring. She assigns 30-40 pages of reading a night. She is super snobby  and if you answer something incorrectly she basically laughs in your face. Attendance isn't necessary  but if you want to do good then read all of the assigned readings.
2.5,worst class ever. first week you learn you dont need to read the worthless textbooks. grades papers like she is a english teacher  has nothing to do with my major. teaching method is as dry as dirt. 30 pages of dry reading per night  3-4 papers. do yourself a favor and get out of that class  worry about design. .
4,"Professor gives a lot of work.. 20-30 pages to read by next class. You will be given six quiz's during the semester to make sure you are doing the reading assignments. 6-8 page research paper will be required. And for mid/final exam you will be ask to complete 3-4 page paper with many restrictions. Take only one class for the semester & get an ""A"""
1,way way way too much work. completely unneccessary amount of work considering it has nothing to do with anyone's major  and distracts you from the classes and assignments that matter. absolutely terrible
3.5,She is a very nice lady in general and she will help you out but this is the most BORING CLASS ever and its a LOT of reading due in every class.
4.5,hard work  a little hard to get used to her teaching stlye at first  once you get it though  it gets easier. Not an Easy class!
1.5,kimmelMAN is out of her damn mind. If you don't say exactly what she wants to hear your wrong. Impossible to get an A. She's rude  and whoever reccomends her is out of their mind as well. Acts as if its the most important class when IT IS NOT. DO NOT TAKE HER.
2.5,Seems like a nice  laid-back professor. Then you get your first paper back and realize that the same writing abilities that have gotten you by with A's since middle school get you a D+ in her class. She's very disorganized and her class is pretty much pointless to go to. Contemp sucks enough without having the the paper nazi as a professor.
4,thumbs down on the group project  but she wants to help. Her lectures are a bit all over the place  but we always had great class discussions. I
1,this class was such a waste of time. i rarely ever went to it. she rambled on in class about god knows what and her papers were impossible to write cause they never made any sense. she grades terrible and the class is SO boring. i really really don't recommend taking her.
4.5,Shes very helpful and commited to the subject. Very knowledgeable. Keep up with the readings and your bound to get a good grade. Simple T/F quizzes to keep your grade up  and 2-3 papers during the course. I would recommend this teacher to anyone looking for a fun  interesting history class.
1,unrealistic expectations  snobby ivy league grad  rude  overbearing  ignorant .... i can go on and onr Basically she makes up her own criteria for citations and writing papers.... I HATE this class and professor. I warned you  never ever take her. Contemp sucks to begin with  but kimmelman made it HORRIBLE
3.5,Ok so this was a real interesting and comical class. She's loud and hyper but her notes are sscrambled and hard to understand. Pretty much do the readings and participate in class n you'll pass.
2.5,Loud  boisterous  overbearing  intimidating  unorganized  and masculine come to mind when thinking of Kimmelman. Be prepared for a lot of reading and note taking to be up to speed. If you talk to her on a one on one basis shes great and will be accomodating but otherwise in class she is not too helpful and willing to stop or slow down to explain any concepts. Best bet is to have her e-mail address on hand if you are confused about anything.
1.5,I remember one of the kids that was working at the orientation recommending Kimmelman and this class. Glass eyed and bushy tailed I signed up and regretted it for 15 weeks. You couldn't understand her writing  graded harder than any other prof that I had  and couldn't care about what her students thought  becuase she was writing a damn book.
5,fun teacher and awesome class! verdammt!

5,Best Teacher at UK! Loved his Class!
4.5,No Comments
5,Awesome Teacher
5,Just wow. I wish that I could take his class for the rest of my college career. We explored campus  talked about everything  and you really get to bond with everyone in class. If you show up you get an A+ b/c he wants to inspire you to get what YOU want out of the class  which makes most people actually care about the assignments. TAKE THIS CLASS!
5,It's a 2.5 hour class that meets once a week. It can seem long at first but TAKE HIM IF YOU CAN. I simply loved him and his classes. They were always a nice break from the heavy course work of my major. He requires nothing except to engage in class when you're there. Attendance was never required but everyone usually showed up because we loved him
5,Once upon a time  there was a professor named Michael Martone. ONE DAY  he got a motley class full of EN 200 students. Some dropped and some stayed  and those that stayed had a glorious time in his kingdom. Once the semester was over  the students and their good grades lived happily ever after. TAKE HIM IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY! The End.
4.5,He really loves writing and gets really into talking about it and telling stories! A very interesting and great person to meet! The class is mostly discussion with some creative writing assignments all do at the end of the semester!Take this class if you are interested in learning alot about creative writing and what it means to you!
5,Mikey is the MAN!! Not only is he funny and insightful  he has a sincere love of the written word and a commitment to his students. He sees the indefinite possibilities of each student. He's an amazing teacher and a wonderful person.
4,Nice lady. quite a bit of reading assignments and quizzes but the quizzes aren't really on the text in the book  but on the short stories that you try to skip over. she gives a lot of writing assignments and is a tough grader. you'll do fine if you go to class  read the short stories  and write your papers well before they are due!
4,Leah is pretty cool. For starters she's really cute  so that helps. She is very helpful and smart. I really enjoyed her class and can recommend her to anyone.
5,21 Chili Peppers ought to tell you something!
5,She was a very fair teacher. Don't expect her class to be super easy just because she is pretty. Don't expect to do well if you don't read/don't retain what you've read. She is very specific about what will be on the tests/ papers and is very easy to talk to if you're confused. No reason why you shouldn't do well if you put forth effort.
5,One of the fairest teachers I've ever had. Always explains what she wants out of you. She has a great personality and she is very beautiful. I reccommend her to anyone  her class is intersting too!-
5,She is a very good teacher. Unlike some teachers  she teaches you how to write and don't spend a whole class period talking about nothing. She is there to help
3,She had a quirky personality  but in a good way. Not what I expected from her appearance or from someone so young. Don't let her looks fool you
4.5,She's a very tough grader in regards to grammar. She is enjoyable though.
4,i was hoping this teacher would be easy on grammar but you dont get off easy! i found her to be a hard grader even tho she is nice enuff.
4,She is a very good teacher. Easy  if you do the work. She isn't harsh on grading and responds to emails quickly. Don't take her super early in the morning
5,I fell in love with her. She is an extremely helpful teacher  and she's an easy grader  too. Just pay attention in class  and do your work. You'll pass with flying colors - no problem.
4,She is a great teacher  the material was at times hard but she was very clear about the works we studied. she knew a lot about the works and was very helpful. make sure to always read the assignments and start ealry on papers. very good teacher.
3.5,Very pretty.. hard to concentrate.. good teacher
4.5,i have her now for british lit the material isnt always intresting but it is still a fun class and i am doing okay in there. but u do have 2 study!!!!
4.5,She is kind of hard but you can make a B if you do all the assignments. When writting a paper start on it early and you will do good in her class.
5,I took her in Summer Bridge also  but she is a great teacher. Just keep up with your syllabus and ask questions if you are unsure. I did it and i got an A!
4,she was a good and funny teacher. i took her for a summer bridge program this past summer and the class was good. she grades firm on your papers though but i guess it is for your own good. but overall  the class was okay.
5,She was a great Professor but to bad she does not teach anymore. she is very Hot and smart. She always has something intresting to say. great teacher.
5,She was funny and easy going. She was always very prompt about answering emails. Just make sure you read your syllabus and do your assignments. She won't give you an A  but it's not that hard to earn one.
3.5,She is a pretty good teacher and is very fair  although that may hurt some people. If you don't do the work  you're not going to do well. Show up for class and read the material and you'll do fine. Essays are kinda difficult.
1.5,Had him 4yrs ago and I still remember how awful he was.#1 worst prof Ive had during my career at Central.Most unfriendly teacher youll ever meet  not helpful tests are atrocious.The brutality of his teaching methods cannot even be measured. Only prof that held class past 5pm the day before Thanksgiving and assigned work to make sure we didn't skip.
3,Never having take B.R. class before I didnt know what to expect. He seemed to know what he was talking about but never assigned reading from the text. Dont take a film class about a director that you dont really like.
4,He was sorta monotone and boring. Pretty easy class though  only 4 real grades  3 exams and a paper. watch movies in class then listen to him lecture
3.5,very boring teacher and he isn't very friendly. Was kind of a jerk to me when I had to miss two classes and I had doctors notes for an excuse.
1.5,Mr. Smith is an extremely boring professor and his tests are IMPOSSIBLE! The test are on nothing that we learn in class and there is no way that anyway can do well in this class. I highly recommend that you don't take this class unless you need it for your major.
4.5,Mr. Smith is clearly passionate about the subject he teaches. He wants everyone to do well in his class and offers advice - listen to it! Sometimes his sense of humor comes out and it's really funny.
1.5,No Comments
3,Sad sad sad sad sad. This guy doesn't know film from his ass. He was trying to tell our class that John Cassavetes directed Rosemary's Baby. For all of you who took 288 and ****ed about the films  you're complete idiots. I hated the class because this guy has no knowledge of film. i could've gone up there and taught the class better than he could.
2,Zzzzz  huh... What? What? oh  this is a 1 credit hour class  and a 2 hour nap. This class is absolutly pointless  but it's required for majors and minors. If you like Mr. Feeny  it may not be so bad.
1.5,Im withdrawaling from his class  im so over it. I tried its just not me. If yer in to it and can stay awake for 2hrs in the morning watchin the great train robbery then try it out but IM OUTA HERE!!
4.5,He's a good guy and KNOWS what he's talking about. So  you find him boring? Listen to what he's saying! He's not hard if you pay attention  and he's very open if you go and ask him for help. He's caring unlike other profs in the dept that I won't mention... Plus I think he's hot... and I'm not even kidding....
1.5,"Our nickname for B.R. was ""The Corpse"" because he was about 98% dead. I think if he smiled his face would crack. The tests were the most awful  obsurd things I've ever laid eyes on. Oh  and I'll pay someone five bucks to ask him what B.R. stands for."
1,TERRIBLE. DONT TAKE EVEN IF THERE IS NO OTHER CLASS AVAILABLE. I DONT KNOW ANYONE WHO GOT BETTER THAN A C! SERIOUSLY PEOPLE..NO ONE WANTS WORK THAT HARD IN A CINEMA CLASS! TAKE DR. J
1.5,Very tough class.... not sure what you need to study but the book was unclear and hard to read :S Really did not need to be this tough. He believes that you are in college and should know how to pick out what matters from the material and what doesn't.
1,he makes 80 question tests out of material for about 35 questions. everything bad said about him is true  and if he choked during class I dont think anyone would help him
4,WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW- Good Guy  but the stress of the job has gotten to him: YOU MUST REMEMBER he is at that PHD level  which he expects you be there with him -- The Tests are out of reach  his Microthemes are extremely worded in a way you cannot attempt to Answer  Unless you have the time  PASS
2,B.R. Smith thinks that a 67 percent average in his class is a good thing. I dropped this class  i had no idea my grade in in till about a week before drops  he doesnt post stuff up on blackboard  his tests are hard as hell. His in class assignments averaged 5 out of 10. Do not take this professor.
1,horrible class and person.....enough said....wait one more thing....wiffed out
1,dont take this class...trust me! it's stressful:(
1.5,He's not that bad  but his exams are nothing like what you study for at all. He gives you a study guide with things that are not on the exam at all. And the stuff he wants you to remember *sigh* I do not recommend this class. It's a big stressor and you're most likely to just scrape by.
1,Good as person but not as teacher. Very Very hard. If you are looking for an A  you will never get it in this class. Don't do it. In the essay i got 65 after that he gave us revision essay so i improved my essay as per his suggestions and he gave me 69  are you kidding me??? You have to be book author to receive an A in the essay. Hell NO
1.5,I didn't have a very good experience with him. I took him online and he was not very helpful at all. No matter how many times I emailed him  he always treated me like my questions were dumb. I'm a science major  so I took this class because I was required to. I tried to get help from everyone I could think of for his assignments but it never helped
3.5,Cuevas taught me how to write a college paper. He was great with feedback  very funny  and really able to relate to the students. He gives you a chance to revise your worst paper and earn points back. Very fair grader  and really wants his students to do well. Would definitely recommend.
4.5,Great class with a great professor!! would HIGHLY recommend
4.5,Cuevas was awesome! He really helped expand my writing and improved critical reading and writing. He will answer any and all questions you have and even encourages you to email whenever you have a question outside of class. He's pretty funny and nerdy too  and the essay topics are actually fun. Overall a cool class.
1.5,Just don't. Unless you're one of his favorites. It's like you think you understand the assignment - you could even meet with him about your ideas and he'll be supportive - and then you make a low grade because you apparently didn't give him what he wanted.
3,The discussions are interesting. For papers ALWAYS attend his office hours  take notes in class  and read the rubric 50 times over. I went from 70s to an 98 and a comment on how much he liked my paper.
4.5,He is definitely the best professor I have had in the English department. He is very helpful  witty  and funny. His class to me is fairly easy as long as you read the assignment and follow his models for how you answer things. He's also super easy to get along with and if you tell him something is not right he'll fix it. Take him if you can!
5,If you enjoy movies in any regard  this class is for you. Mr. Cuevas is fantastically well-rounded in the world of cinema and will enlighten even the biggest movie buff. He assigned two papers with clear outlines and three exams that he reviews for beforehand. Attend lectures because much of the exam derives from what he discusses in class.
5,I took his EH101 class and he is very clear and concise as to what he wants your essay to be constructed as. He is very helpful  and although his teaching can get extremely boring  it is helpful when you sit down and write your essay. My writing has improved by taking his class.
5,Fantastic teacher  always very willing to help out! Don't worry if your first essay has a rough grade  once you learn what he looks for specifically  then it's a breeze! Can't wait to take him for EH102 next semester! Super cool guy!
4.5,Cuevas is AWESOME!! He is so upbeat and loves to have discussions with his class. He does grade somewhat hard  but if you come to class  take notes on the material  participate in discussion  etc...then you'll be fine! Take him if possible  it'll be a favorite class!
5,"Online Class. Read assignments and do work and you should do fine in this class. Not an ""easy"" A  but if you put in the time and do the assignments it is."
2,Just don't do it.
2,dude. just dont. hes annoying. for the final group project  i told him my group wasnt working well together and he sent all of us an angry email. i really couldve cussed him out but i needed my grade. but srsly  just say NO. he looks like one of the angry beavers too. that is the only thing that will get you through his class.
2.5,NOT an easy A. Don't get me wrong  this guy is very nice  but he wants you to put ALOT of special effort into his class. That means talking to him  going to his office  going to library etc. When you write papers  your grade drops dramatically for each minute mistake (for instance a misplaced comma) so beware.
3.5,Mr Cuevas is a decent professor. If you are looking to easily pass a literature class then take him because (assuming you read) you'll make an A with little effort. If you're an English major or someone interested in literature  then you'll be disappointed. Teaching aside  he's a really nice guy.
4.5,Awesome guy but don't take him for UNIV 101 if you want an easy A. His tests were all essay or short answer. I had to spend a lot of time studying and didn't feel like I learned anything. If you're willing to put in the work you can easily make an A. He made the class interesting but I still felt like it was a waste of time.
2,Mr. Cuevas is a nice guy  however  I did not enjoy him much as a teacher. He takes way too long to grade assignments  and never answered any of my emails. His class will challenge you  and it's a lot of work  so if you are looking for an easy A  you might want to find someone else. Again  aside from this  I cannot reiterate how nice this guy is.
5,I loved professor Cuevas! I will take him again! He does expect you to try in his class  but if you put in effort to the class  he will see that and give you a grade to reflect that. I have had teachers here that will not give you a good grade to be contrary  but professor Cuevas is always open to helping  and to hearing new opinions. Take him!
4,This was an online class but she did a very good job of keeping instructions clear. I liked her and would take her again.
5,If everyone is quiet when she asks questions  there will be a surprise quiz. Read even if you don't understand because  if you ask questions  she will keep explaining in differnet ways until you get it. Do not skip the review day before a test. If you don't do well  go to office hours and ask questions. She's nice if she sees you trying.
4,"Feedback was good  though I had to have ""tracking changes"" in Word explained to me. Pretty good for an online class. Lots of reading  but I expected that because of the subject. I always got a fast response to my questions."
5,I have anxiety issues  and I was afraid of online classes. Ms. Sailors gave me her phone number and let me text/call with issues during regular workday hours. This helped me succeed in my very first online class. There is a lot of reading  but I found the book helpful and informative. I believe i learned a great deal in this class.
5,Good teacher. She gave clear explanations of mark ups on papers. There is lots of reading  and you won't pass the quizzes if you do not read. You also need to pay attention to announcements and extra handouts. There is stuff not in the book that you will lose points for if you don't read the stuff she posts.
5,Professor Sailors is great. All of her assignments are pretty easy and you can tell she knows the subject very well. Make sure to complete the assignments and do the discussion participation. The quizzes come straight from the book. Take her if she is available.
5,Easy. If you do the work  you'll pass.
5,Very easy and understand prof. She will go over all things in class and provide any help you need and even extensions if you have a good reason. Take her no matter what!
5,She was awsome and by far the easiest and best professor ive had at uab!
5,She is a great proffesor. If you come to class and listen you should be able to get an A. She wears black all the time. Right before the test she will basically tell you what is on it just take good notes and you will do fine.
4.5,Ms. sailors is very easy and helpful. You have to go to class if you do not understand the stories. You really do not have to read just come to class and take notes and you are bound to get an A or B. But you have to study the notes of course for the exam.
5,She is very good. If you go to class and take notes and listen. You should be able to get a A even if you do not understand old english  she really goes over everything to where you can understand.
5,A very helpful and informative professor.
3,No Comments
4.5,WOW  Ms. Sailors is so hot and smart too! She showed us American Psycho in class. It was SO COOL--she's into the stuff I'm into!
1.5,AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
1,you people are dumb! this teacher is the worst guy ever!!!!!!!!!! he writes so small and gets mad if you ask him a question! im never using this site again! you dont know what your talking about
5,Mr. Morucci is a great guy. He's a little outspoken on politics  but other than that  he's a great teacher. He explains things very clear and in detail. He really helped me understand the material.
2.5,very easy  explains things well  easy class
5,the class is fun  why? because she knows how to teach and make everyhting good...i like the way she teches..I do not understand the rate below...
2,This teacher is terrible  she makes everything into a joke.
5,I love Linda Bobo. She is the best teacher i have ever had. She is kind  sweet  and very beautiful. Just a wonderful teacher.
3.5,The first aid class she is so helpful she loves her job and her support out of class makes her golden
5,A great Teacher. Is always there to help you out. Great at answering questions. Very knowledgeable.
3.5,No Comments
5,I can't understand why some people don't like him. His lecture is very logic and helpful to understand materials. His test is not bad at all as long as you study.
1,Terrible. You cant understand him and he doesn't even know how to work WebAssign or Blackboard. Very thick accent with very poor English. Don't take him unless you want to teach yourself.
4,Very good teacher. He's soft spoken but takes amazing notes. He is the best drawer ever for a math instructor. His test are exactly like the old ones that he gives out and he gives bonus on every test!
3,He has a thick accent and gives a lot of homework. Class was very challenging
5,Dr. Vo is the sweetest old man! His lectures can be a little dull at times but they are incredibly informative and are indicative what his tests will be like. Gives study guides and practice tests for all tests including the final!
2,He was a really sweet and nice guy. Homework is really tough.
5,I have him for Cal II  his tests are easy and always give 5 extra point for every test. Would take him again.
3,calc 3 with him at first it was hard to understand him trust me you get used to his accent  give both online hw and hw he made up. test is heavily based off the problems he made so if you can solve them quick you'll Ace his class
1.5,Not nearly as easy as expected. Had to teach myself the course material because he is not only hard to understand  but also does not explain things well at all. He provides old tests as study material  but sneaks in several unexpected problems. He is known for giving wrong answers in study guides without even realizing it. Take someone else.
4,He's a wonderful  sweet man but he can be hard to understand at times. His test are hard because the proofs are VERY specific  but if you take detailed notes  complete the homework  and read the examples in the text book  it's manageable.
3.5,I have him for Calculus III. He would give 5 extra points on any tests and expected HW every Monday. His accent will get better when you are used to it and try to sit at the front. Very lenient on partial credits. He is quite funny sometime.
3.5,Had for Calculus III. Sometimes can be difficult to understand  but if you sit towards the front you should get it. If I saw his name listed for another math course  I would take him again in a heartbeat
3,Super nice guy who makes Calc much easier. The WebAssign homework is disproportionately harder than the exams--if you can do the homework  the exams will be a breeze  but they aren't too bad anyway. Go to class  review his lecture slides on Blackboard  do the homework  and know the study guides well  and you will make an A+. 1010 would recommend.
3.5,Very sweet man! If you're the type of person who needs their prof to explain everything in depth(like me) he's your guy. Gives old tests to study for your exam  takes attendance and if you don't miss more than two days you can replace your lowest test score with your final. Accent is not bad  but you may want to sit close to him bc he speaks softly
3,He is a good teacher and the tests are pretty easy because he gives you old exams to study. There is a good amount of homework online  and he takes attendance everyday. He does have an accent but you get used to it  and he writes everything he says in the online notes he gives you and on the board in class.
3.5,I really liked Professor Liem. He's always happy and cracked me up during class. His tests aren't too easy but he puts very aggressive curves on all the tests. The class ended up being easier than I expected.
5,He was extremely clear during lectures and made sure that we understood the material before moving on. He seemed to genuinely care about his student's success. There was also a built in curve with the tests.
4,He was pretty clear to understand  and WANTED everyone to succeed. He posted last years tests and answers in order to help us review. Even though he gave some of the hardest webassign homework the tests were cake walks. Not even kidding
4.5,Vo is a really nice guy and you can tell he definitely cares about his students and how well he teaches. He changed his teaching style halfway through the year to make his lectures better. Tests are similar to the review that he hands out but can be long.
4.5,He's really nice! Try to get use to his accent and you will see that he just asks you to be hardworking.
4,Has stop teaching since 2001.
4,Very knowledgeable and mathematically sophisticated  willing to help students as much as possible. Not always as well prepared as he should have been  think he had personal problems. Tried to teach the class in a way so as to impart professional problem solving techniques.
1,unfair and manipulative

4.5,Very knowledgable and approachable
5,After repeatidly taking this course  I took this professor in the summer & got an A. He lectures from the moment class starts to a little over the class end time. To take notes I used my macbook and found it much easier to follow his layout! FOLLOW HIS LAYOUT & Study his notes in the layout he gives 6 hrs a day  his test come straight from notes!
5,Great professor! His notes are very clear and organized. If you study and understand the notes  you will be perfectly fine! He gives lots of examples and is super interesting. He makes biology fun and helped me want to learn. He wont give your grade away.'you have to earn it  but he is fair! Take him! He's always available for help and he cares!
5,Dr. Nicoletto is a wonderful professor. However the exams and material can be very hard. Do not except the class to get handed to you. You need to at least study 5-6 hrs a day if not more. I recommend taking this class in the summer because the grades are better and the material is fresh on your mind.
5,Dr. Nicoletto is an amazing professor! I highly recommend him  and would take him again. He is inspirational  and is always available to help. You do have to show up to class because his tests are all from his lecture. He posts PP's on BB with illustrations  but he doesn't post his notes. Must study daily  but thats with any science class.
5,This is the best and by far the most inspirational professor I have ever had the pleasure to take. If you truly care about science you will love this class and this professor. If you don't care and think it is ridiculous that a professor makes you study  after taking this class you will either shape up or probably drop out of college. Best ever!
5,HANDS DOWN BEST PROFESSOR! Do not isten to toerhs when they say he is a hard professor. If you are there to learn and put the effort in you will succeed! STUDY STUDY his notes..the answers are there I promise. He will teach you what you need to know and he is fair. He will not give you copies of the notes so GO TO CLASS!
4.5,He is a Great teacher but don't think he is just going to let you stroll through his class you have to study and go over his notes everyday his power points are not on black board but he does put the illustrations on there to help you remember information easier
5,Nicoletto is the best professor ever!!! He is not as hard as everyone says  so don't be scared of him  he is very helpful as long as you care about the class and want to learn. Attendance is not mandatory but you have to show up to pass. You DON'T need the textbook. Very smart and interesting man. Take him!!!
4.5,Dr. Nicoletto is by far the best professor I have taken. You have to study  but come on it is a science class. Nobody said anything worth having in life comes easy...
4.5,I absolutely love Dr. Nicoletto. His class is tough and there is a lot of material to learn but if you really want to learn A&P  take his class! He is extremely smart and helpful  he seems intimidating but he is actually a very nice man! Always making jokes  this class is never boring. Take Nicoletto  especially if you're majoring in nursing!
4.5,i took him for 2401 & 2402 and it was HARD AS HELL!!! you have to study your butt off and it is very stressful. he lectures every class for the whole period. you dont really need the book  the test are straight from the notes which are like 15 pgs front and back every class  and the test are HARD! overall he's good and he knows his stuff though.
2,Everything is from the notes  you just have to know it or you fail. Really hard to play catch up in this class  lectures all class and uses examples that are confusing (outdated).
5,I took Nicoletto for 2401 & 2402. Tests are straight from the notes  and hard as hell! You have to KNOW the material! You take notes the entire class period. Attendance isn't required  but STRONGLY advised if you want to pass. He is fair and extremely helpful. Lectures are completely relevent to the course. He's been one of my favorite professors!
4,Dr. Nicoletto is very nice. His tests are totally from the notes. If you study your ass off from those you will pass. Lewis as a lab teacher sucks though. Go for Posey!
4.5,You take notes the entire class period. Don't need the book. His tests are straight forward but annoying becuase it's ALL blank so you pretty much have to memorize everything. He's cool - too much into evolution though.
5,GREAT instructor. Explains all the material clearly and with great detail. The course material is very difficult. There is no attendance req. but if you want to do well in class DON'T miss class. Works well with students that are having a hard time. DON'T take Lewis for lab!!!
5,Nicoletto is by far my favorite professor at Lamar. His class isn't as hard as people make it seem. It's a soph. level biology course and the material is just that. If you know your stuff it's not hard. Take Posey for lab. The two of them are so helpful. Love them!
5,He is a very great professor but very hard! He makes the class very interesting. If you have to take Anatomy 2 you should definitely take him for anatomy 1  anatomy 2 will be a breeze. I love the class  but have had to neglect my other classes to do good in his. Everything comes from the notes  if you make note cards   save them for the final.
4.5,Strict but fair.
5,Really  really great professor. He keeps things interesting and likes to gross the girls out. If you talk  text  etc. he'll do his best to embarrass you. If you want an easy A  do not take this class. If you want to learn  this class is the best. If you don't understand something  he'll work hard to get you to understand.
5,The most caring teacher I've had.
5,The BEST!!!
3,She goes word by word from the book...and your tests are only 15 questions. She assigns homework  but never checks to see if you have done it.
3.5,"ungodly easy... she taught from the book  didnt check homework  and the tests were 20 questions  multiple choice... classes before tests were called ""study classes"" and we wouldnt have class at all... i give her a 10"
1.5,No Comments
1.5,It's a really easy class until it comes to the tests. She basically just teaches every single example in the book and bores you to death. The tests are hard  but as long as you study for a while beforehand  you'll do okay.

1,Very hard to follow. She will write one thing on the board and say something totally different. She did grade on a curve  but I don't feel like I learned anything.
1,SUCKS
2.5,"Although I hate math  I took her because I heard she was easy. Well  it wasn't a piece of cake but if you go EVERY DAY she will ""curve the grades considerably at the end"""
4,She was ok  but I heard that she selects students to stay after class to watch her grade tests.
5,I like her  she forgave me and accepted that a piece of scratch paper really could just be a joke.
5,Very easy  willingness to help with understanding of assignments.
3,VERY NICE AND AN EASY TEACHER

3,she is a easy teacher  but don't ask her to help you outside of class because she won't go out of her way!
3,A difficult teacher but fair. His tests are difficult and his lectures move quickly. He doesn't seem to have much time to personally help a student but most teachers don't.r r Fey is a funny guy with a smart wit and good sarcastic humor. He is cool enough but a HARD MicroCcon class!
4.5,Fey has a funny and sarcastic sense of humor and loves to blend it in. Very knowledgable about economics. Class seems dull at times and boring. The class was a bit difficult  but i think its more about the curiculum more than anything else.
5,Fey's problem is he treats students like intelligent adults  and at IVC most aren't.

2,this class was boring and I was really interested in taking it!! The tests were really hard and all those graphs wanted to make me scream!! I would not recommend this teacher if you want to get a good grade!
2,No Comments
2.5,Extremely BORING he speaks in the same tone at all times and moves his arm across the board slowly  very tiring class and i do not recommend taking him in half the semester  you will fall asleep.
1.5,Very difficult...If you want to pass Econ  DO NOT take it with him. Tests are very tricky
1,I got a C in this class  I worked my ass off and recorded all my works and tests  I should've gotten a high B or even an A. Bad tests  bad lecture  bad grader!
1,His test is really tricky. His lecture doesn't help us understand mirco.
4.5,Standardized class....pretty clear. A's not easy to come by.
5,I really like Prof Fey. He is helpful and I think really looks out for his students best interests. The tests are hard but he always gave free points and his lectures are somewhat boring but he does his best to make them interesting. I recommend!
3,Boring lecture. He isn't too bad. But the scantron tests are VERY hard  alot of the multiple choices/answer are waay too similar to each other. I study ALOT and I am getting a D-C right now. NOT an easy A!!!
2.5,his black humor sometimes just really funny  and his lecture sounds easy  but the exam is not easy at all. have to read really hard to get good grade in that class.
2,you get out of class early... thats about the only good thing about fey... his voice will put you to sleep... guarentee!
4,i had him two years ago. he was pretty easy. always got out of class early
1,HE IS THE WORST TEACHER I'VE EVER HAD. Author's notes  author's study guide  HIS TEST...and anything that could be unclear he DOESN'T CLARIFY. He sucks.
2,He only teaches using PowerPoint slides which you can also get from the textbook's online site. I pretty much had been teaching myself because he couldn't teach. Oh  he's tone is like a robot  that says it all. Take McNeil!
1.5,The first test  the avg was 64% The second test  the avg was 59%. He doesnt teach how to apply what is taught in class  the decrease in avg %'s reflects on his teaching methods.
4.5,His tests were pretty hard but he scales them and gives extra credit here and there which helps a lot overall. The entire semester I thought I was doing badly because I did poorly on my tests but ended up with an A. He is very nice and I thought he was funny... lectures are kind of boring  but I don't think anyone could make geology interesting.
4,Nice guy
5,I had him for Geology 101. He was super
5,I knew him for 2 years. He is a tough and a hard enough teacher to make sure you will learn enough to get a job. He is one of the smartest teacher in my animation program. He is a very friendly person. He does teaches new things like how to make a digital storyboard. He also knows a lot of how the film industry works as well.
5,Very good teacher.
5,Chris really tries to get the best out of people. At times he's just blunt and dead honest. Some people can't see that. Show-up  hand in the work (on time) and do the best you can. cake.
5,best class ever
5,Chris is an outstanding prof. Work hard in his class though because he tends to not tolerate slackers.
4,Helpful and willing to discuss assignments in great depth when asked. Clear and explains all his suggestions when asked. Great Prof  really cares..
5,Best teacher in the program
5,hardest  bestest class ever.
5,DUDE!
5,Super awesome dude  just work hard.
5,Chris is an awsome teacher. Whoever gets him should consider themselves lucky
5,Chris is an awesome teacher  one of the best hands down. He'd give you the shirt off his back  and he'd know the best way to do it too.

4,Good teacher. Very nice guy. Gives somewhat difficult exams but is helpful outside of class. I would recommend taking his course. Solid accounting professor.
2,He is not nearly as helpful as he thinks he is. He is also not someone you want in your corner as he is two faced.
1,I took this course in the summer and Dr. Albright was terrible. He was definitely not teaching at an undergraduate level. I wouldn't recommend taking AC 210 with him.
1,He is NOT a good teacher. He helped write the text book that we used  and he LOVED talking about writing it. He did not teach at an intro level  and was not helpful when you had questions. I would NOT recommend him to ANYONE!!
5,Good Teacher.
5,Wonderful teacher. He's the reason I majored in accounting.
3,He's very nice and tries to teach it well but he is so used to dealing with grad students that he often assumes everyone knows whats going on and doesnt explain it thoroughly for people who dont get it. The tests are not easy  you DO NEED TO STUDY hard for them. know how to do financial statements backwards and forwards.
5,No Comments
4,For an old man  he is fairly good looking.
4.5,No Comments
4,I had him for honors intro to accounting. He did a very good job of teaching the material. The tests and quizes you take in honors accounting are exactly the same as those given in the regular section. The only difference is that you do an EASY group proj

5,Dr. Albright was my AC210 Honors teacher. What an amazing individual! He did an exceptional job explaining Accounting  as it was my first experience with the class.
5,"Very nice professor that offers LOTS of extra credit  even free points on tests (ie. ""just mark A""). If you're struggling  which shouldn't happen much  she is very accessible for office hours and gets back to you frequently on emails. Topics are also interesting and easy to learn also it's just music and learning to appreciate it. Fantastic class"
5,Super easy class for nonmusic majors. Definitely have to put effort into studying for exams if you want a good grade but there are a lot of easy points in the class to boost your grade if you don't do well on the exams. Tons of extra credit points (I went into the final exam with over 100% in the class). Online HW due before class is easy.
5,Susan is a great professor and offers a ton of extra credit. It is extremely hard to not get above an A- in this class. No attendance is taken  however  there are 12 quizzes throughout the semester. Most of the time you can use your notes  she provides you the answer  or gives you points for trying. This is a very easy class for a UP.
5,"Professor Lindahl is easily one of CMU's best. Plenty of extra credit opportunities  and attendance is not taken  although there are weekly ""quizzes"" that you can use notes on. You have to attend 2 concerts outside of class and write a review about them but it isn't as bad as it sounds. This is a very easy class  and Susan only helps to prove it"
4,She was awesome! Doesn't take attendance  but does in class responses randomly. Easy A if you have the notes. Exams you can use a notecard  so it isn't too bad. Plenty of opportunities for extra credit! Would definitely take her again.
4,Pay attention in class or get notes from a friend and you'll do fine. There are in class quizzes at the end  but you can use notes. 3 tests  2 concerts and 1 project all easy to get A's on. She is helpful if you email her or talk to her after class. Boring class  but super easy A.
5,Lindahl was a great professor to have for this class. You are required to go to 2 concerts for the class throughout the semester  but less than other mus114 professors. If you keep up on the online quizzes (you can always get 100%) and do the extra credit youll be totally fine. She really wanted her students to succeed and is very helpful!
3,She isn't the most sympathetic professor  but it is so easy to pass the class. She offers so much extra credit and you can take the quizzes until you get 100% on them. Show up to class though because there are little in-class responses that add up to 150 points throughout the semester. You have to attend 2 concerts and write about them. Overall OK.
5,Organized professor  very nice lady  and very understanding. Easy A if you attend class and put forth the effort. Learned a lot I have never known before. Would recommend if you were to take the class.
5,Great class. All you have to do is show up and pay attention (make sure you get the right notecards). I went to a performing arts school in middle school so I already knew most of the things but she does explain things really well and she is willing to help if you dont. The class was with about 200 other kids so go to her office hours  if need be.
5,Dr. Lindahl is great! I am not majoring in anything music-related  but took this class because I heard it was an easier WI. She doesn't even give that many writing assignments  and the ones that she does assign are easy. The homework is really simple and the exams aren't too bad either. Go to class because she does in-class assignments sometimes.
4,As I'm sure for many who are reading this I am not in the music program nor am I an expert even after this course. But it was a really easy to pass course  professor Lindahl offers a ton of extra credit and you can't not get a 100% on the online homework and quizzes. If you need a music class for graduation this is the way to go.
5,Prof. Lindahl was great. She knew that almost the entire class was taking it because it was an easy UP. Easy homework- online music guides that had to be completed in a week. No reason why you can't get an A. All the answers were in the book  so the assignments were very easy. She's a great prof. if you don't understand music  as she makes it fun!
5,Although I don't understand music nor have I ever taken a music class  she made things very simple. The only way you wouldn't pass this class is if you didn't do any of the work. If you put in the effort  regardless of your test grades  you WILL pass with an A
5,Professor Lindahl is a great professor  who does a good job at explaining the idea of music to non music majors. She gives you guided notes  and if you pay attention you will do good on the exam. She offers lots of extra credit  and gives you ample time to complete assignments.
5,Professor Lindahl was an awesome professor. She is very passionate about music  and it makes it easy to put in the effort. If she can tell you are trying you will get a good grade. Attendance is highly recommended.
4,Susan was a great professor. She gave many extra credit opportunities  and allowed everyone to pass with at least an A if effort was put in. Showing up to class is not mandatory  but is very helpful in order to receive a high grade. She is very passionate about music  but is also respectful to those that aren't.
4,I really liked her! She was very respectful to students and understood that not everyone would learn at the same pace. Very organized!!!! Loved the online quizzes that you could take until you reached 100%. Lots of Extra Credit opportunities. She really cared about music and teaching music to students who probably have never studied it yet.
5,She is by far my favorite professor here at CMU! She is so nice and is willing to work with you in any given situation. There are quizzes online every week but you can take them until you get 100%. I took this as a writing intensive and there were only 3 short papers so it was a relief. I would definitely recommend her for MUS 114WI!
4,Class was filled with fill in the blank notes and that's all you needed to study and fill out the study guides with. Tests go along with the study guide and there's even a review in class for extra credit. She's helpful but a little sassy. Online homework was super easy too  it didn't take long at all.
5,Dr Hovell is one of the toughest but best profs I've had. He is fair but extremely demanding which is good preparation for publishing in the real world. One of the best adherers to scientific principles that I've encountered.
1,Stay away from this professor  my experience was anything but good
1,Difficult to understand.
5,Dr. Hovell helped me to achieve my goals and has been a great advisor. He understands psychology unlike any other professor at State. A+++
5,Mel is the best professor I ever had. Thanks to his passion and sincerity  I excelled in his classes and went on to become a professor in public health myself. I think that a building should be named after this man.

1,Hard and unclear  don't like the way he teaches
3,Biostats is hard! With his lecture book and sample tests  you will do fine. BE AWARE  he is deaf in one ear  so if you sit on that side of him in class  your questions or attempts to get his attention will go un-responded to. He is VERY shy  but VERY KIND if you meet him in office hours.
3,OMG  this class is HARD! The professor reads literally each work from the lecture notes and adds some other details to the notes  but overall  he JUST READS from them. The sample tests are really helpful in understanding how to translate the formulas into practice and after doing the first exam  it gets easier. Very nice person but boring class.
2,This class was SO HARD. Be prepared to teach yourself and spend a lot of time doing it. He's so quiet and class and literally goes over no examples in class. He just reads the notes to you that you purchase in the bookstore.
4.5,Good teacher--very fair and impartial. Uber smart  he knows everything about the subject. Very nice  too.
1,Guys Biostats is tough n this man on earth makes it even tougher!!! He's a PATHETIC professor... ask him to speak without notes...n guess what..he is tongue tied!!!
3,Biostatistics is a difficult topic. Many people do not attend class because it can be very boring  especially the 7pm class. The notes he provides are very clear  and the sample exams are perfect for studying for Exams. He is also shy  and make sure to ask your questions clearly and aloud.
3,His class may not be the most exciting  but if you go to class  take notes  and study his sample exams  there is no reason why you should fail. His tests are open book  open notes  you can bring in anything you want to help you. Nice guy although he may be hard to understand at times.
1.5,No Comments
4.5,very nice.If you listen and follow along then you will do well in the class.If you talk to him during office hours he is helpful.
1,Boring  not a good lecturer  don't understand the material  and not nice  tests are open book
5,Dr. Quintana is one of the best professors I've ever had. Her lectures are interesting and clear. Her passion for the subject of Environmental Health is palpable and rubs off on her students. Exams are very comprehensive  but not inherently difficult. She is very approachable and happy to talk with her students.
2,While nice  her class was extremely boring and she mostly read off the Powerpoint. Often times her sentences droned on to nowhere. Not very impressed considering it was a grad school level class.
5,Amazing teacher  made the subject very interesting and kept everyone awake at 8am!
4.5,Great class- I learned A LOT! Tests are VERY comprehensive  both from the lectures and the book. A challenging class but well worth it!
1.5,Don't waste your time going to class  all lectures are posted. Very boring and unclear!!!
5,Nice  friendly  understanding  and interesting
5,Professor Jochim is amazing! One of the best professors I had in my life. He's passionate  understanding  and such a wonderful professor! Take him if you can !
4.5,He's a very nice professor! 3 exams  one being the final  and 2 research papers. Quizzes are online but it helps to attend class. If you want to understand the lectures better then reading the books help a lot. I came by his office hours and he helped answer my questions.
4.5,Engaging  friendly  intelligent and overall a nice guy. Tests are easy  papers are long but I enjoyed doing the research and writing my paper. Interesting topics and lively discussion. An eye opener in my opinion  gives an in depth understanding of the Chinese religious culuture and traditions. Take this class  it's a lot of fun.
5,Great professor  great class. He will help you understand all the material. A study guide is provided to help you out on essay questions. Also  the papers are easy as well. He is not a tricky professor  he is clear and friendly. TOTALLY RECOMMEND HIM!
5,Great class  but the Daoism book is very ambiguous to comprehend  but the project and class discussion is exciting. The first exam is super easy. Keep up the reading and some background knowledge on Chinese cultures would be helpful for the exam. Wish the teacher could do more group work. Awesome teacher  very humble person.
4.5,Prof Jochim is willing to help students succeed. He responds quickly to email.
3.5,His courses are not easy  especially when you get into the different types of Buddhism. There's a lot of info to be discussed in a short time. ou'll get a lot out of his classes if you show up on time  do the work  and put in a little extra time reading. It's well worth it in the end.
4.5,his chinese traditions class was great  well researched and well presented. his traditions of india class started great but you can tell by the end of the class it was not his strongest area.
3.5,Lectures can get boring so it may difficult to prepare for the exams. However  he gives out a review sheet with all the possible short essay questions he'll ask. Just do your research into it and you'll be fine come exam day. Your grade is made up of an essay and the rest is from midterms.
2,kinda easy  but like diffuclt subject to understand (buddhism). watch movies/films but boring because even he sleeps while watching them REquirements for buddhism: 2 midterms  1 final  1 presentation  1 8-page paper
3,Weekly discussion posts that had to be done  had to read the online textbook. TA posts notes on BB that were helpful for the tests. Tests were somewhat easy  answers are all in the textbook or in the lecture ppts. For a freshman level class  it required some more work than I liked. Read syllabus carefully  he required us to send a welcome email
1.5,took his honors class  i used to like sociology before i had him  he could not be more full of himself  AVOID HIS CLASSES
3,Class is rigorous. You must read the book to do good on the quizzes. The test are not related to the book. You must go to class. You must also have a good understanding of theories pertaining to developing nations
1.5,He is not very helpful and does not care to work with students. If you take his online class know that his test are only open from 7am to noon. Which is not very helpful for anyone that works and goes to school. He also will not allow you to print or save study material. Again very unhelpful to someone who works and goes to school.
3,I took his honors class. He obviously thinks highly of himself and I disagreed with the biased point of view he taught. However  the class itself wasn't too difficult. Two books & lecture material. Online tests covered all aspects. (Could use the books/notes on them for accuracy..but still needed to know the info prior or you'd be out of luck).
1.5,This class is hard!!!! And that is an understatement!!! I only missed 3 classes the entire semester and was still lost. You have to read the book and pay attention to every detail in lecture to understand what this man is talking about and even then you will probably still be lost. I have never taken a class so hard and Ive taken many hard classes
1.5,Horrible prof. I don't agree with earlier comments that if you attend you will do well. I have only missed one class and I am always lost. The tests are ridiculous. They have almost nothing to do with lecture and require you to remember tiny statistics out of the book. I would never take this prof again!
2,He typically has 2 tests  the first test is literally over 1 book adn the 2nd test over a 2nd book. He does let you use a study guide with the test but in a 90 min class the test would have 100 questions  meaning if you had to think about a question for more than 45 seconds you had to turn your test in incomplete. Hated this teacher
1,He is ridiculous. i always attend class and am still COMPLETELY lost.And this research paper is the hardest thing i have to thus far in my 3 yrs @ UNT.Definately not for people who need a clear depiction of whats required of you.
3.5,I thought he was ok  and kind of nice. Yes  he does come at the subject from a unique point of view that I didn't agree with  and it was obvious that he thought a lot of himself. But he made sure the tests covered exactly what was learned. You NEED to read the book to do well on the tests  and you NEED to attend lecture to do well on the essays.
2,I wouldn't say he is a bad prof. once you get the hang of his class. He is a bit arrogant  and its his way or no way. When it comes down to it his class isn't hard if you read and attend his lectures. He is all about his research. I got a C in the class  with minimal effort however. An A is possible if you participate and pay attention
1,"worst ""teacher"" i have ever had in my entire life. if you want to fail a class  go ahead and take this ""class"""
4,Not the easiest class. You have to pay attention and read  or an A is out of the question. Class attendance helps too. Nice guy though  curved my B to an A because I attended most of the classes and made high B's on the tests.
2,Horrible Horrible Horrible  never take his class!! He is such a mean guy  and loves to make students lives bad  also he takes it out on the whole class if students miss or walk out. I know it is rude to walk out  but I dont blame the students who did with this guy.
1,Worst class I ever took at NT. All he does is listen to himself talk. BORING. Will except no opinion but his own. Not a hard class just hard to stay awake. Tries to piss students off because even he gets bored with his endless slide shows. An idiot with half a brain could've read the book and taught the class.
3.5,pretty easy class  will cuve grades. not very interesting  make sure to do all reading. will occasionally give extra credit for attendance.
3.5,definately not easy  and not in the least interested in being your friend- but if you're interested in urban sociology or development you MUST take his courses- freaking brilliant. just don't screw around in class. plus i like his guatelmala stories.
4,He is one of the easiest teachers ever.I was definitely not one of his favs  missed too many classes  & even had to make-up a missed test. He doesn't even require a semester paper  it's extra credit. Anyone that thinks he is hard is retarded and should not be in a higher education facility. He does ramble about Guatemala  but it fits with the class
1,As one commernter put it: run from this professor  not walk. He is extremely unhelpful. When asked to clarify he becomes beligerent. Puts it back off on you as if you are stupid. Unwilling to go out of his way to help you the student. Be prepared to read and basically teach yourself the material.
1,Worst prof I have had in my 5 years in college. He is hateful  mean & rude. It is apparent that he is a man who is unhappy in his life & will take his power of being a professor & use it against his students. He tries to make things as hard as he can. Took him online  only allowed 48-60 seconds per question on tests. Donxe2x80x99t take him!
4,She is passionate and yes you will learn alot but the work load is overwhelming and will dominate all of your time.
5,Dr. Keehn is the best UTSA has to offer. You will work hard in this class but it is well worth it. I will be a better teacher because of Dr. Keehn.
1,Her passion  extensive knowledge and understanding of children definately shines through each lecture
5,DR. Keehn is one of the best UTSA has to offer! She is passionate about educating children and creative in her methods. You will learn more than you can imagine. Be prepared to work hard and stay organized. (Just don't be late for class.)
4.5,Dr. Keehn goes above and beyond all other professors I've ever had  and will proabably ever have! She is wonderful  cares about all of her students  and strives to turn out the best teachers. If all of the professors in the college of education were like her  we would be so prepared for lies ahead in teaching.
5,Great professor! You can tell that she was once the #1 teacher in Texas. She has a true passion for helping our at-risk students! She is also bilingual.
5,TAKE DR. KEEHN. She is tough  but worth it. You will learn a tremedous amount of useful knowledge in her class. We love you  Dr. Keehn!
5,Awesome Professor! She is incredible. She demands alot from you but she takes you through it step by step and helps you every bit along the way. She is so interested in your growth as a pre-service teacher. As long as you do the work and make an effort you will do good in the class. BE PROFESSIONAL!! :)
4.5,Dr. Keehn is the best prof. I've ever taken. She leads her class by modeling instead of standing up there and lecturing to us what we should do as teachers. She shows a personal interest and gets to know everyone of her students by name. Something few profs care to do anymore.
5,Keehn is a very fun teacher and she really knows what she is doing and talking about. I had her for early literacy and she's so much fun. She made the class fun and we got to act like the kids we'd be teaching. She is an awesome professor!
5,Dr. Keehn is a wonderful educator and a blessing to all students.
3,My only complaint with Dr. Scripps' web applications course was that his material was somewhat dated. Direct questions about HTML5 or new JavaScript standards fell by the wayside. That being said  Scripps has an interest in data science  so his thoughts and answers on the internet and web technologies as a whole are very insightful.
2,Tough class. He seems to struggle to help the students who know nothing about coding  but is willing to do what it takes to help. Lots of projects which he doesn't go much over beforehand  and he expects you to try it on your own first.
3,This was the most boring lecture and I eventually stopped attending. If you show up for the lab portion and do the online homework on your own  you should get an easy A. This was a very easy class but required a lot of time doing online work. I think Jerry was a very smart prof  but he had a hard time dumbing it down to our level.
3.5,I took Scripps for Comp Sci 162. He certainly knew what he was doing when it came to programming and he usually was able to get the information across. No real tests during the class other than midterm and final. He uses a flipped classroom so be sure to watch the videos before class. Good  not great teacher. Would take him again though.
3.5,Scripps has a very unique style of teaching. You watch all of the lectures on YouTube before class as homework and then go over the topics in class. This method helps a lot  because you can code right along with him and can pause and rewind. Any questions can be addressed the next day in class as you go over examples. Very good professor.
5,Scripps is a bad ass dude. Take this thug for your classes because he's a great teacher. Scripps if life. Scripps is love. Scripps is all.
2.5,I went in with a tiny bit of programming experience  and have not found the class to be all that difficult. Scripps was an overall average teacher in my opinion. Very funny though!
5,Scripps is a great teacher. Some people new to coding might have trouble  but he's very available to help if you're having issues  as is the lab assistant and your classmates. Not too much textbook use  flipped classroom style was extremely helpful. Taking him next semester for 163.
2.5,Scripps isn't a easy teacher. He can be funny and is a genius when it comes to coding  but he doesn't really do a good job teaching it to you. he isn't much help in labs at all either. It's hard at first because I had no programming or coding experience. I learned everything just fine  but mostley by myself with my text book. he's a funny guy tho.
3.5,The course itself is difficult. Starts off really easy  but by the end of it you're left confused (unless you already have a background in Visual Basic coding). Scripps was funny and nice  class was usually pretty entertaining. The only downside is that when you're in lab  he isn't that helpful. He just kinda shows you what to do.
4.5,This class itself can be difficult especially if you have no prior experience in programming  but all around scripps is a excellent professor. He makes the class fun and he is really laid back.
5,The class is hard....but I'm not rating the class I'm rating Scripps and HE IS THE MAN!
4,I had this course a while ago  He is a great guy but expect to work a a lot...I had a little bit of programming experience before and still had some difficulty. Now  2 years later  I am good at Java I can see how this class could be a blast. I didn't really feel like I learned from him until the END of the semester though.
2,If you've never had prior programming experience  don't expect to understand Scripps' lectures. Having said that  he is very nice and a fun prof.
5,He is a great guy  extremely helpful  and actually makes class fun.
3,Jerry is a funny teacher and very easy to get along and work with.
3,"Make no mistake about it  if you've never had programming before this class will be very difficult. That being said  Jerry is a really nice guy and I ended up with a B- and should have gotten a C. His ""car"" examples are a bit lame but we does try to communicate the best he can."
2,Scripps didn't have a clear class structure - bounced from one idea to another in random order and sometimes came back to previous ideas. With limited notes  he was not well prepared for class. Students with some experience could have taught this class. He relied on students knowledge to write the correct syntax and he referred us to Google alot
3,This professor is ill educated in the line of his teaching. I feel as though he was a waste of my tuition and time. I would not ever take him as a professor again nor would I recommend him to anyone else. Never was well prepared for classes  and the students seemed to teach more than him.
4,I don't know why this guy doesn't have a yellow smiley face by his name. As someone else said... he is the man.
5,Hillarious and insightful  a real treat to hear talk  but you need to put in some effort to do well
2,If you do not pay attention you will not pass the class. He is an extremely tough grader  that being said you only get graded on 5 separate things. 2 midterms  2 paper and a final. If you pay attention and do the reading you will be fine for the most part  but showing up to class is a must or you will fall too behind and not do well. good luck.
4,I absolutely loved this class. I would definitely recommend him as a professor! He's a no-nonsense kind of guy  and his lectures are really eye-opening to what's happening in the world.
4,Deviant Behavior was the best class I've taken at Assumption. The class is very easy for the most part because you are studying how people defy norms in society. Gendron's lectures are AWESOME. Best I've had. He gives examples with the notes WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL for your in class essays. Overall  amazing professor  and great class.
4.5,Professor Gendron is probably the best professor at Assumption College. He gives you the honest truth and actually talks about stuff that is relevant to today's society. His lectures are extremely interesting and he is more than helpful during his office hours. But don't be on your cellphone during class.
4,"I'm not really sure why he has a chili pepper because he is old  but nevertheless he's an awesome. He's really hard but it was worth it. He tells it how it is and doesn't give you all the ""politically correct"" bs. He's a very cut and dry person. Really enjoyed his class."
5,Best professor at Assumption College. Always keeps discussions entertaining and insightful. Also he is the most knowledgable person I have ever met
5,Absolutely the best professor I have taken at Assumption. He is clearly passionate about what he teaches and his lectures are so engaging and interesting. Taking Gendron made me decide to be a criminology concentrator...don't miss out on this prof!
5,No Comments
5,He is an amazing professor! I liked going to his class every day and he influenced me to become a sociology major. The exams can be difficult  but he gives study guides. Class discussions are usually interesting  and he shows movies sometimes which helps class go by fast.
5,Go to his office hrs he likes to know his students Before all of his tests he gives study guides but his tests are hard and not all the info on the test comes from the study guide so make sure you use your book for reference 3-4 papers(3pgs min) are assigned analyzing newspaper articles.
5,Very intelligent  passionate  and helpful. Great to talk to outside of class. Wants you to succeed and does everything he can to make sure you do. Awesome  awesome professor.
5,best prof at AC. easy to talk to  laid back. Knows his stuff  passionate about what he's teaching.
5,KNOWS HIS STUFF> Passionate! not your average professor! HIGHLY reccomend his class! His class made my decision to be a Soc major  YOU WILL LOVE IT!
5,Gendron is the Best! He is SO hot! He is an awesome teacher. His method of teaching is really helpful  in and outside of the classroom.
5,Gendron is amazing. I can't say enough good things about him. He's a fair grader  and really makes class interesting.
5,Gendron is awesome. He's so helpful and nice!
5,He is easily the most intelligent professor on this campus. I'm sorry I waited until my senior year to take a class with him! He'll really make you think about things in a new way. Highly recommended!
4,Would definately recommend him to anyone. HE really tries to ****off the class and you learn so much.
5,Gendron is HOT! Influenced my decision to become a major... the best professor on the AC campus.
5,I took two of Mr. Smith's classes but I had withdraw during the second class. Now he is no longer teaching at TCC. :( He is an excellent teacher and a very nice person. Thank you  Mr. Smith!!!
5,I had Prof Smith back in 1994. Although we had different opinions politically  and they were discussed at length in class  he was one of my favorites. The way he conducted himself and the class was wonderful.
5,Excellent professor. Very passionate about what he's teaching. Involves class in a lot of discussion. Gives study guides that walk you through the test practically. If you give it some effort  it's not hard to make an A in any of his classes.
5,He is very educated and concise. He challanges his student and pushes the line of reasoning and critical thinking. He is fun and makes his content relate to his own life experiences.
5,Prof. Smith has to be one of the best instuctors/mentors in the world. I recommend that everyone try to take one of his classes. He will engage you in discussion and make you really think. Scott
1,Laura is one of the worst english professors on campus. She is moody  aggressive  and tries so hard to be liked by her students that she comes off very annoying. I took her for EWRT 2A on campus and she was very unorganized and confusing. She didn't have a set calendar and her canvas page was a mess and she was very rude if you asked for clarity.
1,ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. This quarter's been stressful AF. Her online class is SO disorganized. She grades essays strictly by format. She's so f* useless  I could learn more from a brick wall that from her. I felt like I was begging for help to no avail. Students that either were interested in learning or at least want a fair teacher  AVOID.
1,Orella's EWRT 1B class is the worst online class I have taken. She makes no effort to explain anything  let alone teach  and her comments on papers are vague and unhelpful. If you want to learn anything about writing  you are in the wrong class. If you want to work very hard for a low grade and be on your own  this is the class for you!
2.5,This class is super easy  but you won't learn a thing. Actually I am pretty sure my writing got worse as the quarter progressed because I was able to completely blow off all the assignments until a few hours before they were due and still get 80-90% on the papers.
4.5,I don't see why there is so much negativity. Her class is bearable and so long as you turn in your work and participate your bound to get a good grade. She is reasonable and offers great info prior to your essays. I would personally recommend the online class. I got an A in the class and did little more than what's expected of a student.
3.5,Mrs. Orella was a good teacher  you had to be in class and understand the work being asked to do  just like any other class. Her class wasn't hard at all  you had to earn a good grade  but this class did improve my writing.
1,I see most other students were just as unhappy with this instructor as I was. I ended up really sick and emailed this instructor that I needed her to work with me re assignments  etc. after ABSOLUTELY NO REPLY  I dropped the class via web. Not sure if there system glitch  the class didnt drop  she gave me an F and I never even turned anything in!
5,She's such a cute lady! Orella is super nice and outgoing  and she makes you feel comfortable in class. Only 3 essays total  and no exams. Easy readings assigned.
1.5,Online class. Too many essays and lots of reading. 4 essays total and she isn't very helpful when you ask questions. My main issue with online was all of the smaller forum posting requirements and due dates that are placed in various places on the website. Can be tricky  would not recommend this online format.
2.5,You have to be organized to take this class! Not structured by week but by major assignment. Difficult if you don't already know how to write essays. Doesn't give feedback on rough drafts (peers do)only on your essay after its graded. Doesn't lecture - you learn by doing workbook sheets. 4 essays w/ rough draft  various exercises  online research
1,Absolutely horrendous. Online class  and while I didn't have to do the chats weekly that some others mention  I can relate to the frustration. She grades things weeks after they are due  her class is completely unorganized  and she never responds to anything. Her feedback on your submissions is vague and of no help at all. I wish I could rate lower
1,THE WORST AND MOST LAZY TEACHER EVER!REPORT HER WITH THE DEAN  IT IS NOT FAIR TO HAVE TEACHERS LIKE HER.She canceled more than half of the classes does not check drafts  classmates do.The final is really a draft that you send by email.She replies telling you something general about your mistakes not helpful.I wonder if she really reads the essays.
1,Her online class is horribly confusing! She is totally unhelpful and snaps at you when you ask for help  instead of answering your questions. And the assignments and readings she gives are not easy!
2.5,In person (its an online class but we had a mandatory orientation for an hour)  she's kind of hyper  a little intimidating. The online course is somewhat confusing  if you don't look all over the place for clues on deadlines  instructions  etc. you're gonna have problems. She is a bit unclear  and that is why I prefer to actually go to a classroom.
1,This lady has to be one of the worst teachers at DeAnza. You have to be an accomplished writer to get an A. she doesn't teach you anything about writing. and yes you have to think like her and agree with everything that comes out of her mouth.
5,She is great teacher!!! She help me on WPE test from Sacramento State. Her class is easy and fun. I enjoyed her class very much. After I take her class  my reading  and writing skill improve very much.
1,Very unclear about what she wants. You never know your grade until the very end. Comments on the rough drafts never make sense (she doesnt actually read them) and tries to make her students opinions fit hers in the pointless and frustrating 'class chat'. Dont take this class if you like to know what it going on.
1,unclear  moody  should be teaching grade school. tries to mold students opinions to fit hers. site is completly unorganized. tons of pointless work. this is an analytical class but you'll be writing informational papers and learning elementary grammar. i've never disliked a class so much: awful. :(
1.5,"This is an online class in which she requires one hour of class ""chat"" weekly between 10 - 11 pm  which makes up 200 points of your grade  and two group ""presentations"" you're supposed to post online. Definitely wouldn't suggest taking this class unless you like doing an excessive amount of work."
1,unorganized kinda hard to navigate through the interface if you are not too computer savy.She doesnt seem to help too much.You have to really be patient and work through the site.Content wise its not a hard class.The structure of the class makes it frustrating.You wont learn much about writing here.
5,The best professor at gsu
5,WOW! the easiest English teacher I have ever had in my life. class was based on 3 out of class papers and 2 in class. professor Erickson is extremely helpful when you ask him for help. My skills as a writer have improved thanks to him.
5,Very passionate about British Literature  which ups his cred as a professor...always willing to get involved in student mindsets about assigned pieces throughout the semester...LOVED THIS MAN!! 2 papers  1 midterm  and 1 final [all of which are 25% a piece]...you gain revision rights on the papers  and he is an easy grader on quizzes and tests
4,If you love literature  you'll enjoy his class. His lectures are relevant to the poems/stories that we read in class.You need your book to follow his discussions. And if you want to do well on the final  come to class because his key points on every poem/story is necessary to do well on test. Essays are easy and he will help you when you need it.
5,He is the best professor I've ever had. Intelligent  passionate  hilarious  and truly wants his students to do well--and he will teach you how to write. Not an easy grader  but lenient with due dates and always willing to work with you. If at all possible  TAKE HIM!!!
4,If you don't like this guy  you're taking yourself and your studies TOO SERIOUSLY. He's completely avoids BS rules  such as attendance  solid deadlines  mandatory class participation  etc. However  he is a hard paper grader
3,he is an amazing professor! very easy! only a few papers are due during the semester  but he has not final exam. I really loved him!! he is funny  only thing bad about him  is he is kinda boring at times.but other then that this class is an easy A
4.5,LOVE HIM. SO AWESOME and FUN
4.5,WOW!!! He was awesome and helpful! Loved his class wish he taught 1102.. Only wrote 5 papers and no final!!!
5,If you want to learn something about literature and  even more  about writing solid  cohesive papers that you can be proud of  YOU CAN TAKE NO ONE BETTER. One of the BEST instructors I've ever had. Casual & funny in the classroom  tough as hell grading papers  but hey  you're in college
2.5,He comes in  sits down  and talks. for 2.5 hours straight. nevermind if you dont' understand  he's off on some random tanget by the time you get a notebook out.
3.5,He is not my favorite teacher. He goes off on huge tangents  and it's honestly hard to pay attention. He's a nice guy and very enthusiastic  but I don't really recommend him. It's the first English class I've ever had that I didn't love  and that's saying something.
5,Awesome  insightful teacher... if you ever need or want to read anything by Spencer  this is the guy to study it with!
4,"He is extremely funny. The first day of class i was convinced he was mentally insane but by the end i was in love with him. Doesnt care about attendence. Very loose about due dates but care about important stuff like the quality of your work. He claims to be "" A hard 'A' but a fairly easy 'B'. It pretty much rings true."
3,he taught my senior seminar class  and since he'd never taught it before  just kind of tossed things up in the air to see where they'd land. thought it'd be tough  being required to graduate  but he kept all his same policies of attendance and due dates  meaning none at all. confusing  off the wall  made us cringe  but glad i had him after all
4.5,probably the most irreverent teacher you'll have. he can be a little dull at times  but mostly he's very fun and helpful. due dates are by no means set in stone and he will actually give you youre paper topics. an easy b  hard a.
4.5,Very passionate  intelligent. Incredibly blasphemous and vexatiously political. Funny  lenient grader (no one could possibly make an F or a D in here)...I got all A's. Doesn't care about due dates as long as you talk to him.
2.5,"He has a strange concept of proper academic writing. I have never gotten grades so low on papers before (B- and B+) and his identifications on his tests sometimes seem like they are asking  ""What's the third word on page 33?"""
4,This guy knows what he's talking about so well that it's sometimes hard for himt o convey it all to students. However  he is ALWAYS willing to negotiate on due dates  and he makes you earn your grades. Very passionate and fun teacher.
4,He is enthusiastic. He really made me become a better writer and a better reader. He is interesting and helpful.
1,She was very rude  didn't let you ask questions if you were unsure about her assignments (which was like all the time). She was absent every class after the first month of the semester  no warnings  notes  anything. It was a horrible class.
1,No Comments
3,i did good work but lame grade didn't appreciate here approach to teaching
5,No Comments
3.5,No Comments
1.5,This is one professor i did not learn much from. When A student asks for help and she doesnt know how to explain it she'll say why don't you do it for homework. She also does not know what her own syllabus says. She doesn't know her own grading policy.
3,Ah  Dr. Rorke  the gatekeeper and decider for all things WHP. Although he can be intimidating and expect a lot of students  he is overall consistently clear on expectations (as long as you know where to look). New students: heed warning and check all syllabi posted on the WHP section of the Oakland website. The answers are there - just read.
4,I took WHP310 as an online class with Rorke. He definitely knows his stuff. I would say he is not the most approachable or understanding professor. His class is very interesting though. All online exams are only open for a short window of time. Be prepared! Not an easy A  study for exams even though they are open notes.
5,HE IS JUST AWESOME!!!!! Tough professor but WONDERFUL!!!
5,Excellent professor. I thoroughly enjoyed his lectures and look forward to future courses with him. He is very knowledgeable and well published in his field.
4.5,Dr. Rorke inspired be to declare WHP as a major and I graduated last spring. Encouraged grad school  MS in Health Ed  I highly recommend him and the WHP program for an undergrad.
2.5,I guess you either like him  or you don't. He is a bit full of himself  and he is hard to please. He is really serious. All I have to say is have fun with the practical exam.
3.5,Tough class  but this prof is very into what he teaches. I personally thought the class was kind of boring  but I am not into this subject  and only took the class because I needed an HC course. The projects are tough and he grades hard. The tests aren't too bad though  but you do have to know your stuff.
4,great professor!
4,And WHP 311! He is a great professor  very passionate and I highly respect him as a person. He is concerned that you do well and expects you to take an active part in the classes and in your education. He has a sweet accent and has many life stories that add to his classes!! Not a blow off by any means  but hes a GREAT GREAT PROFESSOR!
5,The BEST professor at Oakland EVER! He is very passionate about what he teaches and is very eager to help if you have questions or problems. He goes out of his way to make learning not only fun but rewarding as well. I can't say enough GREAT things about him! I would take more classes with him if I could! Oakland needs more professors like him!!
5,Just graduated from Oakland in May. Dr. Rorke is an amazing professor! He makes learning fun and inspires students. He is straight to the point and is serious about his students education. Enjoyed every class that I took that Dr Rorke taught.
5,Dr. Rorke is by far the best professor I have had at OU. His enthusiasm and passion for his work is beyond words. I learned more from this class than any other course at Oakland. Tough teacher but  rarely boring or difficult to remain attentive in class. Extremely helpful!!
5,Dr. Rorke is the best teacher at OU. He is helpful  funny and is always available to students. I would take every class with him if I could. His class is hard but you learn SO MUCH. Put in the time and effort and you will get an A.
5,Great instructor! He is extremely knowledgeable  has a great deal of experience in the field  and teaches with passion and enthusiasm. He has high expectations of his students and challenges them to think for themselves  but is always there to help anyone who asks.
5,He is from South Africa and has the coolest accent. It's hard not to pay attention in class.
5,Great instructor  very helpful  multiple choice tests. great class
4,Dr. Rorke can be very strict and very demanding on his students. This class teaches you so much-so it is worth it!
4.5,His door is always open. He will like you if he knows that you are trying.
5,Awesome instructor- very knowledgable man. I loved listening to him talk. Favorite class
5,Very nice teacher  fairly easy class. She has a very slight accent but it doesn't get in the way at all. Grades fairly and is very helpful.
4.5,Mrs. Weeks is very nice  but a little strict on grading papers. The english department made it hard to receive an A in the course (95-100 = A). She is lenient on pushing due dates for papers  but you really have to put effort into the paper itself. She does care for the students but she does want her respect. She has her pet peeves.
5,Great teacher. Easy homework assignments. Flexible paper due dates. Class is a bit boring and really no need to attend to get an understanding...but she takes attendance everyday so I would def go everyday. Overall  Great teacher
4.5,Mrs. Weeks is a very nice teacher! She has good humor and is willing to help any student who asks for help. Very great professor.
5,Mrs. Weeks is great. She is so helpful and nice! Her papers actually have cool topics that interest you. She is flexible on paper deadlines which can ease a lot of stress. Take this class for sure!
3.5,she's okay...she will pushes the paper back a few days if the whole class is not able to turn it in on time  or if u cant turn it in on time...just tell her and she let u turn it on late...she grade kinda hard on the papers.
4,Ms. Weeks is French. A little hard to understand at first  but she's very helpful and a great teacher.
1,Has a great knowledge of poetry
2,Here's the thing
5,if you cant appreciate his genius it's a reflection on you. Extremely serious abt poetry and demands the same of you. Am repulsed by the whiny ratings of others. He's the best and most caring prof. I've ever had.
2,Save yourself and your sanity and avoid Dr. Stokesbury. Yes  he knows what he's talking about  and at times makes some nice points-- but his tests are absurdly difficult and he is fairly rude and abrasive. I'd steer clear of this one.
2,Stokesbury's mean spirited teaching style seems intent on discouraging his students from enjoying writing. He doesn't give you any grades on your poems until you get your final grade after the semester. I failed the course simply because I didn't turn in a second revision of my poems I had worked on most of the semester and he graded them as zeros.
2,Absolutely  by far  the WORST professor I have ever had. He's rude  he's arrogant (for no reason at all)  and he is consistently 10 minutes late to class  but marks you absent if you are 1 minute late. It's his way or the highway  don't even think about making suggestions. The only way to get a good grade is to do exactly as he says  no imagination
1.5,Wow. Where to begin? Leon rambles  endlessly. When he does speak directly on a piece of poetry  its a miracle if he has something important or poignant to say. He's rude  an ass  and in no way at all helpful. He's also too self-assured to ever be wrong  so do not disagree with him or your grade will be affected. One of my worst Professors  ever.
4,Stokesbury knows what he's talking about. He's the hardest teacher I've ever had  but I also learned more in Form and Theory than 5 or 6 other graduate classes put together. Take him if you're serious about learning  not if you're looking for an easy A.
2,His tests are hard. He will make fun of you. He will ramble about off topic subjects. I learned the most from the other students.
2,Rambles on and on and on about the most random things....tests are ridiculously hard. Basically have to memorize over 25 poems/poets  identify stanzas from poems on the test  then write as much as you possibly can on the poem. Wish I had never taken this class.
3.5,Stokesbury knows his****. I learned more in this class than any other I've taken at GSU. But his testing methods are pretty archaic. He's from the old school of-chew-you-up-spit-you-out-and-see-if- you-can-dance kind of teaching. And he's a dick.
3.5,Not very open to alternate interpretation. Uses his own poetry in the class and makes you buy his books. Interesting speaker with lots of real world poetry experience.
5,This is the best teacher I have ever had. He really knows his stuff and works on your writing as hard as his own. I recommend him for only those courageous enough to work and hear the truth about their work. This guy really refines your stuff! Take often!
5,Wonderful professor if you're willing to work. Knows his stuff  gets things done in class. You definitely get your money's worth in his class. But he won't tolerate idiots. (If you had problems with one of his classes  you might fall into this category).
1.5,i couldn't stand this class. he tells the same stories over and over. plus  he seems to have this bizarre chip on his shoulder. plus he sometimes makes comments at a student's expense.
3,Took him Fall 2002 for Creative Writing in Poetry. Made us spend $40 to buy TWO of his poetry books that we opened only ONE of ONCE. He has a very pompous attitude. Takes roll and calls you out if you're not there. DON'T bring food to class!!!
3.5,"Tests very difficult. Knows his poetry. Hope you like Patty Ann Rogers  ""rolling naked in the dew."" And loves R. Frost. Leave class if he begins the ""food stamp"" story. Expect one of his own poems on the final."
5,great teacher and i learned alot  i love interaction it keeps me awake through the lectures. she is very fair on grades and explains everything very clearly
5,She is so nice and so helpful. This class has no tests  just case studies that take a few minutes to type up and then one big project. Her class is hands-on and she guides you through building your own business. Highly recommended class and professor
5,she's a GREAT professor  very informative and understanding when you have problems.
2,I eventually just stopped going to class and just taught myself the material. No website  no homework solutions  little or no lecture preparation.. If you are looking for someone to actually teach you math  avoid this prof.

1,Terrible  avoid at all costs
1,don't. just don't. trust me.
1,The most boring math lecturer I have ever had to sit through. He is absolutely not helpful in class or outside of it.
3,lecture is not really necessary as it won't help you much. just skip and spend the time doing the homework. the tests are unpredictable but not unfair
1.5,Boring professor. Takes student suggestion  works through it  THEN states that it is erroneous. Tests seemingly don't correlate with HW material. Absolutely horrible.
2.5,He really hates doing examples in class and will not unless you force him to. Instead he focuses on theorems. Asking questions in class is a must. No calc or notes allowed on tests.
2,His lectures were all about theorems and never examples of problems. Like some one said before the average of the test was super low. Plus he was always late for class. The quarter was hell cause of this class.
5,The Man is bored with what he teaches. I love him as a Prof he pushes those who need to be pushed.
1.5,The tests  lectures  and homework all have nothing to do with each other. The homework is excessively long  and almost no one can finish them. As for the tests  they had the lowest averages I've ever seen--on one the mean was 0.5 points out of 20!
1.5,Most frustrating educational experience ever! She did not clearly demonstrate what she wanted from me as a student writer. Her written comments were hard to read and harder to understand. Worst of all  she bristled when asked for clarification  help and guidance.
1,Do not take this class!!! It is super hard. She is very unclear on what she wants you to fix for her essays. I should have dropped the class but didn't. Drop if you are not an English major seriously!I got an F. When i asked for help she laughed in my face and made me feel really stupid. Drop this class!!
3,She loves what she does and can be slightly rude at times but means no harm. is EXTREMELY HARD at grading  feed back is not enough help to improve your work. Discussions are the Best  gets you thinking. Had to drop b/c of difficulty.
1.5,Horrible Professor!! Don't take her if you are used to writing good essays. She will be very rude (laughing at your mistakes for instance) when you ask for guidance.
4,Proffesor Nichols is extremely helpful throughout the entire course. Even though the class is not easy  the topics and discussions covered make it worth it. I Received a B in her class.
4,The class is hard. I got a C. 2 in class essays. One 10 pgs research paper. About 4 books for her class. Pop quiz is easy. She is funny. but you need to work hard  very hard to pass. The hardest English class I've ever taken in my life. I don't love her  and I don't hate her either!
3.5,Hard grader. Points will be docked for every mistake you make on your essays. Do not take her if you're lazy. However  she really does care about your progress. I shared a smoke break with her every day and she was always willing to discuss what I need to improve on. She is a great and I respect her so much for pushing me to do my best.
3.5,Prof Nichols is pretty great  although she is a super hard grader and definitely very particular about citations and following MLA format. I really disliked how many in class essays we had for her class (three in class  two out of class). Her harsh grading definitely helped my writing skills though. Don't take her if you want an easy A.
5,She is a GREAT teacher! She challenges to think and has many discussions. You really have to read the books because she does give pop quizzes and they are necessary for the discussions. A bit hard on grading essays  but you can take the out of class essays to rewrite again for extra points and it helps out with your writing skills. Love her! :D
5,She is FANTASTIC. Yes she is a hard grader but that's just because she expects college students to write at college level. She will patiently and clearly answer all of your q's and allows you to revise each of your take-home assignments for add'l credit. Quizzes are easy just make sure you do the reading and come to class on time. LOVE HER!
5,Professor Nichols is one of my favorite teachers here at PCC. I had a 7am class with her  and I never dreaded coming to class because she made CLASS so fun. There were many discussions in the class which is always interesting. ALWAYS READ THE READING ASSIGNMENTS! AND ALWAYS COME TO CLASS EARLY or you will miss out on the pop quiz
3.5,She's not that bad as people describe her. Take her in the summer! She seems alot more chill. Quizzes were super easy and she gives you alot of chances to make up for points. You just really have do good in essays
2.5,She doesnt care about situations  and you will think shes a cool teacher but shes not. Her grading was crazy  i had all A's and B's in english in high school and she would give me D's ad C's on my essays. DONT TAKE HER!
5,I <3 her. She is an awesome teacher. It's very important 2read the assignments. If u make note n ur book ahead of time 4 the in class essay u'll do wonderful. She always gives a hint bout the topic 4 the essay. Besure to have all ur pages marked. Think bout what u can agrue w/ the text and comeup with a few sentences (memorized) before ur essay.
1,She basically don't care about our situation. The worst English professor I have never have in PCC.
1,Her class was disappointing. Classes are about discussions of topics that do not have anything to do with English. I wanted to learn more about essay structure  but she never taught anything about it even though she was very hard while grading. She does not have any office hours available and did not answer any of my emails. NEVER take her class.
4.5,Nichols is really cool. Very friendly and upbeat. Not a hard grader in my opinion I felt this class was an esay A as long as you did the assignments. All the people that complained about the workload must not have realized what English classes are about- reading and writing  lots of it- duh!
3.5,extremely hard grader! but you'll deff learned a lot!
2,Got an A in this class thanks to others English Professors.r Prof. Nichols is a terrible teacher  as during the whole semester she has not taught a thing about how to be more effective in argumentative writing. The class is spent in useless discussions on her personal opinions about different subjects but doesn't give any clues on how to write bett
3.5,If English is not your first language I will not recommend you to take her. And if you don't really like writing take someone else. I agree with people here that she is a good teacher and she love to teach. One thing you must know that she is quite a hard grader.
3.5,Nice instructor  will answer texts if you have questions about assignment. Grades based on 4 papers and journal entries. Does not require textbook  but will print out short passages for you to read. Lectures tend to be long  but she seems to care that you do well and provides you with useful feedback. Fair grader and opportunity for extra credit.
5,ENGL 1301 was by far my favorite of my first semester in college. Professor Mach provides her students with everything they need to know in order to be successful in her class. She is always there for her students  has a very clear grading criteria and is an overall exceptional professor. She has the best attitude I've seen in a teacher. Amazing!!
4.5,English is my 2nd language and I struggle a lot writing essays...therefore not a big fan of it  but her class was great. she is fun  helpful and great thinking. Clear assignments and fair grading... would take her in the future if I oculd
5,She is one of the most fun  cool  relaxed  inspiring teachers I've ever had. She is probably the best teacher I have ever had!
5,She is one of the most fun  cool  relaxed  inspiring teachers I've ever had. She is probably the best teacher I have ever had!
4.5,I had her at ACC. Really nice. Fun. Class is mandatory (3 abs. allowed)  but she's understanding if you need more. She won't GIVE you an A  but it's not hard to get one. I never bought the book  I just looked up the stories online. Definitely recommend her. It's 5 essays  a final essay  and some easy journal assignments. Take her if you can!
5,Extemely awesome teacher...completely unlike your typical professor
5,Absoultly love this women...she is so laid back and easy to get along with. She loves to have classes that interact and discuss rather then telling you what to know
5,Its an easy A
5,Really Cool
5,Mrs. Mach is a really cool teacher. She jokes around with everyone and makes you feel comfortable. I would recommend anyone to attempt to get her for an English teacher!
5,He's charming  witty  cultured  and charismatic. I would date him  but this is not a dating site. Do the weekly assignments and study concepts he tells you are going to be part of the essay questions and study guides  and you will do well in his class.
4,Professor Catalano is a cool dude. Really enjoyed his class  attendance is mandatory if you want to pass. Tests are rather tough but he offered huge extra credit at the end of the semester. Oh and you need to buy HIS textbook  about 90 bucks. I believe he said he curves final grades if needed
5,His class is very entertaining and is easy. His classwork and homeworks are easy and he doesn't quiz you. He also tells you whats going to be on the test which is awesome but theres alot! He makes you write about three essays for each tests and there are also true false questions.
4.5,His class was really fun. He was very entertaining and kept the class interested. He is very passionate for what he does and loves to interact with his students. There are only three tests and are very easy if you read. DONT BUY THE HUMANITIES TEXTBOOK POSTED ONLINE. He has his own textbook that he requires you to buy. He'll tell you what to get.
1,Absolutely no structure to the class making it extremely difficult to know when or what to study. Must buy text book written by him and filled with spelling errors  excessive rambling and organized poorly. Do not recommend.
2,The tests are incredibly HARD. I saw that pretty much everyone in my class was getting D's. The text book is a book that he wrote and it's full of typeOs. The lectures were extremely boring. He does NOT have power points or notes so if you are a visual learner(as many people interested in this class may be)don't bother. Nice guy though.
5,This class seems super cool but it is quite boring at times. It focuses on the history of art but he's a cool guy. He's a bit full of himself  but a good professor. Class is based on 10 activities you do from watching a video in class  2 tests  1 final  and 3 critical reviews on movies/plays/or galleries. There is extra credit  take the class!!
5,He is an awesome prof! Took him during ext spring semi and got an A. He is super easy!!!!! He goes over what will be on the exam and makes you prepared! Only thing I didn't like were the videos because they were kind of boring. But overall I recommend him!! I wish he taught more courses so I can take him again! EASY A!!!
5,I took his class in 6 weeks and got an A! His class is easy and he is a really nice prof! I would take his class again just for fun. I had two tests and 1 final- T/F are tricky  essay is easy  and fill in blanks are easy. One of the easiest class I have taken at PCC. Only thing i didn't like was the boring videos we watched in class. Take him!!!
5,Prof.Catalano is a very nice helpful and knowlegable professor.I took his class during my first semester at PCC. I was so scared because English is my second language.But his tests are very straightforward and he will drop the lowest test score.Also  do all movie reviews because it will help to boost up your grade.Best Professor at PCC+Nice Person.
3.5,Don't buy the book PCC tells you to buy at the bookstore because he has you buy a different text. This class is really good for those who are interested in art history. If you don't find art history interesting  you'll probably think the class is super boring. Lots of memorization of art periods  artists  media types  etc
4,Good professor but he will let you buy textbook that can't be sold back because it comes with access code. His tests are medium. IF you study  you will pass and get good grades. As simple as that. There's 2 tests  2 movie reviews  extra credit movie review and final exams. He drops the lowest one grade final exam is not included. He is so-so.
2.5,Boring..probably because it was a night class  but I must give him credit for trying so hard to engage us. He is quite the character and if you do the reading and assignments you're sure to ace the class. Assignments usually include going to the movies  a play  or museum and writing about it. (Easy right?)
5,Professor Catalano is AWESOME. he is really passionate with his teaching and he is definitely not boring! study for the tests  he gives you a review sheet and you will be fine! great teacher i recommend this class 100 percent!
4,Fun teacher  tries to make class lively with jokes  accents  he's weird but enjoyable. The course reader he makes you buy sucks cuz you only use 2 pages  but its mandatory. He's in the entertainment business so the critical reviews are based in that area  watch a movie/ play/ visit museum  write a review  EASY. Tells you exactly whats on the tests
5,Passionate teacher just pay attention in class  take notes  and do the critical assignments and EC to pass...
5,He is an AWESOME professor  one of the best I've ever had. He makes the class fun and interesting with his acting and drama voices. Boring movie to watch at the end of every class though. Tests are simple  he emails a study guide of whats exactly on the test. Very sweet & nice guy. He will gladly help you with anything if you need it! RECOMMENDED!
3,His CourseReader is useless. Most of the content is copied from the book. We have to buy it only for three coverpages. He also doesn't allow us use copies of his coverpage. May I ask  who wants to spend 30 bucks to buy only three coverpages!! So he is just a thoroughly profiteers.
4.5,This teacher is really cool  he was a USC professor. This class is very easy. To compare with another Human4 teacher Forman  Mr Catalano did teach something  take him  you will get A
1.5,none
5,He has a lot of heart and loves to teach. He will make you an outstanding classical guitarist and a great lead guitar player if you play steel guitar too. Just be open to his teaching method and put in the hours.
5,Do not take this class if you just want to learn regular guitar  not just nylon string. This class is classical style only. You need to take 83A instead  there you can play acoustic or nylon string and you'll cover several styles. In Jones class  you have to play exactly how he tells you  so if you can't change your playing way  you won't be happy.
5,Prof. Jones is an excellent  passionate classical guitar teacher. He teaches music theory so you understand it too. His class is for CLASSICAL guitar  so be serious and open to this method. He knows what he is talking about and there is a reason why you must do it as instructed  it will all make sense when you advance to the more elaborate pieces.
5,One of the finest teachers at PCC. If you are at all interested in classical guitar  I implore you to take his class.
5,When I walked into the class  I already had 6-7 years of classical guitar lessons. When I played for him  he really beat me up over technique  and I hated him for it  but kept coming to class anyways. It really payed off. This guy is brutally honest  but he genuinely cares about you. Take him  no matter what level you are  you will learn a lot.
5,Prof. Jones is an excellent guitarist & an even better instructor. He has a passion for classical guitar & he shares it with his students. And makes sure technique is correct:)
5,Great teacher! He enjoys helping students and has a great sense of humor. He teaches everyone as if they had just begun playing guitar. He is very interested in teaching his students and what they want to become. All you have to do is practice playing and you do great.
5,He was a great teacher and really hammers home the fundamentals. He teaches a student as if he knows nothing  learning from the ground up. I continued to go for repeated semesters because his love for music and teaching would rub off on me. He is the best Classical guitar teacher at PCC  hands down.
5,Extremely Nice and Gentle~ Always smiles~ Really good at teaching classical guitar!You will Love it!!
1.5,Apparently for a beginning classical guitar class you must have been playing and know to read music. I took it for winter intersession for an intro guitar course but from day one he already has the intention of weeding out those who can't play. I'd suggest avoiding him if you're trying to learn it for fun.
5,this is my 3rd semester with mr. jones  and the reason for that is because he is a wonderful teacher! really nice  knows his stuff  very smart. i learned alot about theory too  teaches what should be taught. encourages everyone to play. inspired me to keep on learning. very fun class. if you want to learn  take this class  worth it!!!
4.5,He is a gifted guitar player and can really teach! he has the patience and is very understanding. Attend his class  try your hardest and you will do fine!! There is nothing to worry about  he is a great gifted teacher  you'l love him!!!
5,Mr. Jones is a gifted instructor. He is knowledgable  friendly  approachable  and easy to undestand. The very first day he is kind of scary and seems closed-minded  but I think it's just a show to make his point. He is always helpful. I wish he taught other music classes as well. We are very lucky to be able to take classes from such a great teacher for so little money.
5,this is the guy you go to when you want to kick ass. if your not ready  STAY AWAY  he will tear you up!
5,Steve was the first actual guitar teacher i ever had. He has lots of patience and is very helpful. Will somebody please put a red chili under his name already! He is the best!
5,The man is very informative on guitar technique. He will be the best guitar instructor you will ever have. Doesn't discriminate on playing ability. He helps everyone who tries their best. He kinda looks like the Treat Williams  the dad on Everwood.
5,"Easy and really helpful teacher  if you don't want to learn don't take him...I mean for people who are stubborn or think they know already how to play guitar- think again. This class is ""classical"" guitar and he teaches the standard method- strict positioning  fingering  notes  etc."
4.5,Really good Teacher Pretty funny and very helpful  if you have any problems playing he will help you solve them. Easy going guy with lots of professional music experience which is very helpful for someone who wants to grow as a player and performer. Highly recomended
4.5,Started playing guitar when he was 4 yrs old! He's amazing.
5,This guy is awesome. He was very helpful and patient.
3,To many students  his class were hard
5,Great teacher  you just have to study. Students hate him because they dont read the book  so they have a hard time in the class
1.5,This teacher is HARD!! he try's to trick you on tests  there is A LOT of outside homework. I wound not take this class. He makes students feel dumb for asking questions  and there is a pretty big paper you have to do.
1.5,He is really strict and the tests are extremely difficult  and he doesn't like any students who come late. Do not take his course.......
1,He makes econ look like rocket science. Don't ever take him for a GE course  only if you are an econ. major.
5,I took his Native American history class for credit and enjoyed it so much that I came back for US Hist. Dr. Boucher is an awesome teacher and I genuinely learned a lot from him
2,Dr. Boucher seems to be a nice person that wants his students to do well  however  he expects a great load of work and participation in class. As an incoming freshman I managed to do pretty well in all of my other classes except this one. It felt like more of a philosophy class that was set up for failure rather than a normal history class.
5,Dr Boucher is super personable and nice. His history lectures are interesting  even thoough I'm not a huge fan of European history. He's really funny as well. You definitely need to read the books he assigns as you have quizzes on them  but for the most part there's not much quizzing on stuff he posts online unless he talks about it in class.
4,Love this guy. The American West is a very interesting course however. His class is solely based on readings and discussion. Make sure you read read read  and you will do fine.
5,Awesome dude! I got a decent grade even though I skipped a bunch. Tough grader but hot accent. 8/10 would recommend!
3.5,He probably only has clarity and funny going for him. His class requires to be fully engaged and participating every class in order for him to like you. If you aren't participating  in his mind you aren't trying and it seems like he grades your things even harsher. For those who just like to listen and can learn without having to participate  GL
3.5,Boucher is a really chill  funny guy. He knows his lectures can get boring so he cracks jokes and gets off topic sometimes to make things more interesting. You have to take a lot of notes so it's hard to know what you have to study but I'm horrible at history and NEVER read but I still got a B-.
2.5,He takes this class way to serious to the point where it's obnoxious. It shouldn't be that hard for a HIS116 class. Exams are all based on lectures  and he doesn't give any slides  notes are all vocal. Do not take if there's other possibilities.
4,3 sets of essays  a few reading quizes  can chose to not write final paper. I wrote the final paper and he bumped me up from a B+ to an A-. Go to office hours and get him to read over your papers. No tests. Super funny!
4,3 papers  4 quizes. Harsh paper grader- never felt like they were that bad. Go to office hours and let him read them before turning in. Quizes are all on reading but he gives you a heads up beforehand. Class was kinda boring unless he got off topic. Loved his accent though. Would recommend  but he is hard on papers.
5,Very nice  helpful  and fair. Definitely take advantage of his office hours if you need them  very helpful. A lot of reading assignments  but they aren't always necessary and you learn a ton. One midterm  term paper (hard paper grader)  a final  a few quizzes. I'd definitely recommend him  he is great! He makes the class.
4.5,Hilarious guy  boring class (the entire class was in Christopher Columbus) Take home midterm that's allllll essay  but the final was multiple choice. He's a really tough paper grader  I often felt my papers were not nearly as bad as he scored them.
5,Great guy  very enthusiastic  always cracking jokes  as previously noted very nice. Would take him if you can!
5,By far the most helpful teacher I've had at college of charleston!! Super nice and super helpful! Very enthusiastic about what he teaches and really wants to see his students do well and enjoy the class. If you pay attention  take notes  and participate you will do just fine!
4,Dr. Boucher is an excellent lecturer and is great about meeting during office hours. His class only has 2 take-home exams  4 quizzes  and a final. Exams are on the readings and are graded harshly. The quizzes are on class notes. Attendance is listed in syllabus  but he rarely passes around a roll sheet.
5,Boucher is probably one of my favorite professors. I did not like the idea of modern history but he made it fun. I never read the book and aside from the paper I never did any outside work and I averaged a 97. Yes he is pretty attractive. He's also very encouraging and helpful if you need it.
5,I had such a crush. Great guy. Useless course  he was the only reason I went.
4.5,Wonderful teacher! Enjoyed his lectures. He gives a hard exam but so willing to help you improve. Go to his office hours. He's very friendly and engaging.
4.5,Probably one of best professors i've had so far. He's extremely helpful and really cares about his student's grades. The lectures aren't too bad
3.5,Real nice guy and is really helpful if you go after class to see him. Cracks some good jokes in class to break up the boredom at times. Lots of optional work that kind of helps out on tests. The tests are extremely hard though  I would say avoid if you want your gpa to stay where it is at.
4,Like others have said  class is extremely workload heavy. Expect a paper  test or project due weekly. But Foreman really knows his stuff and wants you to succeed if you put the work. Gives out so much extra credit that it's impossible to fail and getting an A or B is doable. If you care about learning  take this professor.
2,Foreman really knows his stuff and is beyond knowledgeable about the subject matter. The class is VERY workload heavy  with weekly case analyses  exams  and group projects. Foreman is a hard grader with high expectations of his students! Be prepared to spend many long nights typing papers and conducting very in-depth case analyses.
5,Dr. Foreman is a teacher that actually cares about your education if you do. The material can be difficult  but if you put in the effort and study you can get an A. He is easy to listen to during lectures and the course-work (for me) was very interesting. Pretty funny guy too!
4,Although he is a tough grader  everything you need is provided. Either go off of his powerpoints for papers or go in for help. He is one of the most accommodating professors for those who go in to ask for help or with questions. I bombed a paper but was able to learn from it and got nothing but 85% or higher for the rest of the semester.
3.5,Class is not easy by any means. Multiple papers and group projects. Not to mention that Foreman is a pretty harsh grader. However  there is so much extra credit that it's impossible not to pass. Didn't do good on a few assignments and still pulled off an A
4.5,I would definitely recommend Foreman! The three week summer course was a lot of work but the class is discussion based so as long as you read the case studies you are fine. He is very laid back and entertaining. There is a lot of writing and analysis in this course  but as long as he is seeing you are putting forth effort your grade will be fine
3.5,I took a 3 week summer course with Foreman. The class was brutal  and I don't recommend the summer course. Foreman is a great guy  knowledgeable  entertaining  and fair but one of the toughest profs for this class. You will do about 10 case studies  have 2 tests  2 group projects  and a presentation. If you do all of the work Foreman will pass you.
1.5,This class is not hard to pass  but it is hard to tolerate. This man is impossible to listen to and brutal to meet with in his office. You will learn some interesting material and read some good cases but be prepared to use a thesaurus in class if you want to understand him.
4.5,One of the best professors I have had. I would recommend him over any MQM 385 teacher. People who complain about this class are those who like definitive problems/results and struggle to think outside the box. He may grade you lower  but there are so many points that it is impossible to not get at least a 'B'.
4,Very good teacher! Its impossible to get anything lower than a B if you actually put forth effort. Alot of papers and group work  but by far the best teacher to choose for this senior level class!
4.5,Great teacher. Lecturing is at a minimum
3.5,Class was a lot of work for not many points at begining of semester  but he gives alot of extra credit opportunities. End of semester there are alot of points left  but actually learn the material so it isnt difficult getting the points.
4,By far the best professor I have had. YES-there is a lot of work and YES the class is hard. But he goes above and beyond trying to do what he can to help his students understand. He gives lots of extra credit and help. He has a great way of relating to his students. He is passionate about what he does and his work reflects that.
2.5,Overall tough class  lots of group work and has you read a lot of cases. Back end loads the course so that most the points are at the very end. If you work well with others its not hard to do the presentations  but he does like to favor the girls for participation points. He was an ok teacher  but grades very harshly.
4,he wasn't that bad for Business Organ. we had a lot of assingments and 3 tests. plus we had 3 group projects. so there is a lot of points you can get. he curved everything we got back. i would totally reckomend him for 220 evadently not for the upper level classes. he was nice to our class and we got out on time.
1,Arrogant arrogant arrogant! This man is possibly the most arrogant assh--- I've ever met in my entire life and has zero people skills and basically doesn't admit when he makes a mistake. Absolutely no help  arrives late to class  yet has expectations that you are on time and professional when he clearly is not. He should be fired immediately.
2,This guy is a complete ****. Try to switch out of his class if at all possible. Everything that everyone has said below is true  and for me it was even more. He has no respect for his students or their lives and thinks that his class should revolve around him.
1,Homework always returned late - class of 20 and have to wait 3 weeks sometimes. Kept classes late - our last one was 40 minutes late. For many assignments  he sent out another page of clarifications due to the ambiguous nature of the first set of directions - sometimes when you had already completed the work or only had 24 hours left to do so.
1,The guy was an arrogant conceited jerk and the entire MBA class full of adults all had that opinion of him. He deducted participation points even if you had to leave the room to go to the bathroom! One person left the room due to having a coughing  fit and he deducted points! He is in love with himself and loved to brag about his BMW to the class.
2,No Comments
3,In all honesty  Karen is not all that bad. Granted  she leaves comments and does seem like a stickler  but shes OK. Finished the class with a B+ and I feel that she helped my writing out a lot. I would recommend her class  however it is very work intensive  even for an online class.
1,This lady has a huge ego problem. She doesnt respond to emails when you have a question  and when she does get around to them  she treats you as if you are an idiot. I have never been treated so poorly by a teacher in my life. Honestly  don't take this class  because if you get on her bad side  she will be bias. Worst professor at NCC period.......
1,This women is a total nut. She is nasty  unclear  and arrogant. She doesnt treat you like an equal  and leaves unprofessional comments in her emails. She is late with grading  and refuses to answer questions without getting mad or making you look stupid. I wouldnt reccomend this professor at all. Im an A student and I think this lady is an airhead
5,Awesome class  lots of intense work but it pays off. My writing improved greatly.
4.5,the most stimulating teacher i have ever had! has given lots of A's to deserving students.
5,she seems to really care about her students and to enjoy what she does. my writing has really improved after taking her class.
4.5,just had you 2 weeks so far and i think your a good english teacher
5,I think Karen is a very good teacher  she is very clear in what she wants done  and she can make a challange interesting.
5,Took this class online and it was very easy. As long as you do the homework and practice exams it is an easy A.
4,Tough grade. Do well on tests
4,Great teacher  and is straight foward. I have had several math professors at parkland. And he is the best i have had! Good amounts of homework  but not strenous. Quizzes and tests are very clear  and are similar to what YOU ARE ACTUALLY STUDYING IN CLASS!!!
2,Tried taking this class online  dropped after the first Exam that I Flunked. Never answered emails for help  told me to go to tutoring center for help  I took online since I am a working adult and couldn't take on-campus course. Never felt like could keep up with the online program and work. I am an A student  but was going to flunk if didn't drop
5,Jay is a straight forward professor. He teaches for concepts not for memorization  which is helpful. He is funny and occasionally takes the day to just talk politics with his class and get to know students. There are frequent quizzes but they cover literally exactly what he taught in class. Exams are predictable if you go to class and do the work.
5,good teacher
4,He is probably the funniest teacher ever. Does a great job explaining concepts  but doesn't take too well to questions. He has a low tolerance for self-explanatory questions because he expects highly from people in Calc II  but it is definitely worth taking. Especially from Jay Ko.
5,Jay Ko told us one the first day of class  if you can't pass this class with me you shouldn't be taking it. He give you all quiz answers in the lecture and the test are comprised of the quizzes.
4.5,Jay is a great teacher and is very clear in his description of Calculus II concepts. He is extremely funny and always engaging during class. He's the perfect balance of a teacher who actually does an effective job of explaining material and making class enjoyable.
4,It was much easier paying attention in class Jay. He keeps things entertaining. His tests are VERY STANDARD. He is more worried about understanding concepts than memorizing equations.
5,MUST TAKE !! do hw   lecture examples  extra problems  and your golden
4.5,Jay Ko cuts through pompous textbook explanations and teaches the essential knowledge. He will not pamper you though  and I think that made a lot of people drop the section. I will take him again for calc.
4.5,Jay Ko will not pamper you  he will teach you to destroy math though. I will be taking him for calc.
4.5,His lectures are pretty straight forward and easy to follow. He likes to give out exam related problems during the lecture  so it's best to show up. He grades a bit harder than most  but you will do fine if you do the recommended problems and show up to class.
3.5,He basically gives the type of questions that are asked on the exams and final. He mainly just takes questions from hw and lecture notes and just changes them a bit. So if you understand the concept your fine. It is important that you come to his classes on time.
1.5,He's awful  impatient and not helpful.
4,If u are taking his 228 math class  its easy. He is a good guy (keep using some bad jokes in his class). A little harsh about test. His homework is not too much. He said he did not like 124 or 129 class maybe thats y some people didnt feel good about their class.
4.5,Very good teacher! If you want to learn math  then look no farther! He was a Steelers' fan so we got alone. But serious very good teacher  teaches the bigger picture in math. Exams and quizzes can be tricky tho. I would recommend him for any math class if you really want to learn the material!
5,I think he was a great teacher. He was helpful when you asked. The thing I liked the most is that his lecture notes are straight forward. What you see in the lecture notes is what you will see on the test. I personally recommend him even though some would say otherwise. He gives lots of examples and explains very well.
3.5,Pretty good teacher  in the truest sense of the word. Not very nice when you ask questions  however most of his meanness is said jokingly. He is very clear in what he wants. His tests are pretty hard.
3,Very annoying voice. She will get very easily upset with a class and will baby you in GBA 145. The material in the class is what makes it super easy-- study skills  how to use University resources  etc. so the class is dumb anyways.
2,I had an A at midterm and then she lost my papers after taking a leave of absence for over a week (right before finals.) I can only imagine her TA's do all of her grading and getting your grade changed is a hassle as she never replies to calls OR emails. Being a professor is clearly not her #1 job  so beware.
1.5,"Brandy Zito Frost has no business being a college professor. Her class is a joke  and a retarded monkey could teach it. She also needs to take the word ""absolutely"" out of her vocabulary! Seriously  she never returned phone calls OR e-mails  and (after months of this) when I went to her office (she obviously could not communicate)  she made me w"
5,Mrs. Frost is my advisor  and she is very refreshing to deal with. Most of the CBA advisors that I've dealt with won't shoot straight with you  and some of them just act like half-wits. Brandy  however  will get right to the point and tell you everything you need to know. Also very nice.
2,No Comments
2.5,SUPER EASY Class
5,Brandy got married and is now Brandy Zito Frost. You have to work in this class  there are several projects  but everything you do benefits you personally and professionally  it is not just busywork. I strongly encourage everyone to take this class. It is helpful  and Brandy is the best!
5,She is an excellent teacher. Her test are pretty straight forward with no stings attached. She's just that good!
5,Wow! She's an awesome teacher. A motivational class that helps focus your goals / career plans. Thanks Mrs. Zito
5,She is awesome. I would recommend her to everyone.
5,take it  she really cares about her students
5,No Comments
3,I took his online Intro to Statistics class. He didn't leave feedback on problems I'd miss  in order to tell me what I was doing wrong  so I'd have to commute to college to talk to him in person.
4,I had him for calc 1. I would definitely choose him as a prof. again. Homework isn't mandatory which means quizzes and exams are the only thing he grades. I didn't study as much as I should have and when final exams came  I struggled. He's easy to understand and helpful outside of class. If you show up to class  you shouldn't have any problems.
5,"I really like this professor. He's one of the best math teachers at Parkland. He teaches ""with"" students and not ""down"" to them and always encourages questions and tries to answer them the best he can. Very pleasant guy to be around and I've found his grading to be very fair. Diff EQ is a tough class  but he wants you to succeed."
3.5,I personally do not care for this professor because of his teaching style. He only gives grades on quizzes and exams so if you don't do well on those then you can't really redeem yourself. His homework isn't required to turn in but recommended for practice. He is a very tough grader!
4,I had this professor for my stats class! In all honesty I struggled a bit but with A LOT of studying outside of class  I managed to pull an A thank god. He was a kind teacher who did care for my grade and if you put in the extra effort  will reward you greatly! He gave lots of opportunities to better test scores.
5,If you come to class and take notes you will have no probably passing the class! It is important to study for the test and quizzes because thats the only grades you will recieve. The homework is optional. If you study your notes you will have no problem passing the test or quiz. You have to be willing to put the time in to study to pass.
4.5,Statistics - I liked Phil as a professor. He went over examples in class that looked exactly like what he puts on the quizzes and tests  so your notes are basically the only thing you need to use to study for this class. He is very consistent on tests and quizzes which is why I would definitely recommend him!
1,I took Calc 1 as a freshman. In highschool  math was my best subject. He did not do well at explaining WHY he was doing things. He would just go through examples. By far the worst teacher I have ever had. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS. There are other teachers that offer Calculus and I have heard much much better things about him.
4,Best math teacher I've ever had. I took calc 2 in high school so this was a refresher course in a way (i did horrible in high school so i needed to relearn it) but he went over an enormous amount of examples and was easily accessible & so open for questions. I wish he taught at the university!
1.5,Disliked this professor. Tried extremely hard in the class and did not do so well on the final because of problems outside of the classroom and he lowered my grade to a C even though I had earned a B in the class as far as percentage wise. Makes you sign a contract that says he can do this. Awful.
4.5,Easy to understand  fair in grading  and very helpful. Also very attractive.
4.5,Very clear and helpful but a REALLY tough grader
4.5,Very well organized  easy to understand  helpful with great examples.
2.5,Ok  this teacher was extremely not helpful at all. His powerpoint lectures provided would always have mistakes in them confusing the students on how to work the problem correctly. Teacher was easy to get a hold of but if you got a problem wrong because of his error. Tough Luck...
4.5,"His lectures are a little boring. However  he makes math to be ""candy"" and is very helpful  especially in office hours"
5,Only B I ever got in Math. Should have gotten a C - but I still ****ed at him about not giving me an A. Very tough subject (Calc 2) - he's got a clue.
5,Great teacher easy grader!!!! I should not have passed this class with a C!
5,This is a clear cut  do the work  ask questions when you need to  and you'll get a good grade guy. Fair  funny  and good in a subject a lot of teachers are not.
5,"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! Excellent teacher! The lecture is fun  he takes time to make sure everyone is on track  the homework isn't overwhelming  and he is pretty hilarious. I really don't see how anyone wouldn't like Phil unless they fall into the ""didn't work  got poor grade  must be teacher's fault not mine"" category..."
5,Phil is awesome. He spoon feeds you. All you need to do is put in the numbers from the problem on the test. is it was 5+6-7 on your homework  itll be like 8+9-6 on the test. you just need to study the process. people who dislike him are EXTREMELY lazy.
5,He is an Awesome Down to Earth Guy! He is willing to help if you have problems! He's the best professor I have ever had! He cares a great deal about his students! I totally recommend him for a professor for an easy A+
5,Super easy A+! Nice guy!
5,He is a very straightforward teacher. He wants us to do well and not fool around. If you do all of your assignments and attend class  you will make an A+. Not hard at all. You don't even stay the whole class most times. Easy A.
4.5,Great guy!!!
5,He is a really nice guy and is willing to do anything to help you be successful in your college career. The class is an easy A if you do what he asks yu to do and you go to class.
4.5,He is a generally a nice guy  and I think he really does have intentions of truly helping you.
4,Really nice...you have to do the assignments though  but they aren't hard at all! Great class
5,easy way to get 1 hour
4,Boring ass class. He drones on and on about BS the whole time. Considering i almost never go and still have a Pass  its simple****. When your sitting in class  it feels like when a cop talks to you if you did something bad and about how bad it was. God he is boring. -_-
5,Very easy class..You don't really have assignments except for things like when U of A has like a career fair  you will be asked to stop by the quad and get 3 brochures of careers you are interested in and then you have to type a resume at the end of the course.. but it is very simple! All you have to do is go and he is a 0very nice man!
5,AWESOME GUY AND EASY TO GET ALONG WITH
5,He is a real peoples person  who has went to college himself. Great stand up guy  and straight forward person. great man. Easy A.
4,No Comments
2,He is not very clear when giving assignments and he doesn't have good people skills at all. Seems very nervous when teaching and treats students like little kids. Not good with controlling the classroom   do not take course
3,Tough grader
1.5,Horrible teacher. Does not teach anything  just hands out assignment sheets and gives too much time in class to work. Paces back and forth across frot of room  talking to the wall insetad of the students even when answering a question. Stutters over every word and seems extremely nervous  even in a small class.Avoid him if you get bored easliy.
3,Nice guy but I'm not a big fan of the class.

5,Great professor  if you do the work and post on the discussion boards you will do just fine! He outlines clearly what is expected in papers and if you follow what he tells you to do not only will you get good grades but the papers are easy to write.
5,Iv taken two online classes with Thom  and have nothing but success in both of these classes! He is very understanding and flexibility on late work. Although I was in condensed classes over the summer  I didn't feel rushed.
4,I have taken 2 classes with him. Awsome teacher! Makes class fun  and different than others! Gives you plenty of time to work on papers. Papers are not long  but detailed. Follow directions to a T.
1,I have taken classes with him before  but not online and loved it. His on-line course is disorganized and extremely difficult to follow. Took class in the fall and he still had the schedule up for spring. Lack of communication and very difficult to contact.
5,Excellent professor! This is the second course that I took with Professor Schnarre (intentionally) Very fair and keeps you entertained.
5,If you pay attention  turn work in on time and follow his instructions you will breeze by. He as a wonderful professor and keeps class entertaining.
2.5,He is a really funny and good guy and I like his personality. Class was also cancelled a cancelled a couple time  so that was nice. The in class workdays are optional so if you don't want to go on those days  you don't have to. The feedback he gives is confusing and the answers he gives aren't very straight forward sometimes.
1.5,He is very picky about his papers and if you have one thing wrong in MLA style he will take alot of points off! Good luck I finished with a B but it was hard to get the B.
2,Terrible teacher  at least online. Completely unwilling to actually help. Anytime you ask for help he just refers you back to his online content and accuses you of not doing any of your assigned reading. I tried to meet with him at his office and he basically told me no  his feedback was clear. When asking for help he's rude and disrespectful.
4.5,He's very specific on his grading material and really goes into depth on what should be included in your papers to make page count and write good content. He's very approachable and has a lively attitude  loves his job. Only down side is he doesn't critique papers at all if you're already a good writer. Easy class and great prof overall.
2.5,This class was TOUGH. I pulled numerous all-nighters to be able to pass. But  he did help me become a much better writer for the future and with taking 106  I don't have to take anymore english classes. On my final I thought I did really good but he marked me down  and till this day I don't know why!
4.5,If you listen and follow directions and ask for feedback  Thom is really helpful. I am a better writer nok
4,Pretty clear class. He wants what he wants  but gives you feedback on drafts in class and spends a lot of times making sure you understand stuff.
4,Get ready to step outside your comfort zone and open your mind to learn new ways of seeing things. He allows you to test out ideas and theories through writing. If you are a good writer on top of that  you will ace the class and enjoy it immensely. However  the minute you close your mind is the minute you have set yourself up to fail this class.
1,There are only 5 actual assignments and then participation points  so if you don't do well on a few things you are really screwed. I never knew what he really wanted from me because his feedback is awful when you submit your rough drafts. He's slow to respond to emails and when he does he doesn't answer half your questions anyways.
4,Thom is a very interesting guy. Be prepared for that most of all. His subjects  in my opinion  are a little dated but they are pretty easy to write about. He's a tough grader but if you know how to write  this class will be a breeze  just be prepared to work at it.
3,A lot of effort is needed to pass his class.
3.5,This was an online section and some complained that the site was hard to follow. I think they didn't read the stuff. If you do and really pay attention  you can do fine. He wants what he wants. Give it to him.
4.5,He fine tunes your stuff. No big revelations about writing except it takes time and lots of drafts to come up with good stuff. Very reasonalbe in research component. Funny guy.
4,Thom wants what he wants and is fair and resonable. he allows you to write on ANY topic  so some of the peer stuff is interesting  but it's cool to have that freedom. Good input!
5,Great teacher. He should be cloned. Enthusiastic  very funny  knowledgeable  encouraging. Take his class  you won't regret it.
4.5,One of the best acting teachers around  enormously helpful without getting creepy. Funny to a point that it is hard to focus on the actual class. Ask him about his cocktail phrases.
4.5,BEST TEACHER EVER!!!!!
5,Soo funny and enjoyable to work with. He's Brilliant!!!

2,He is a very well intentioned man and very smart  but he has a lot of trouble getting ideas across and there is minimal organization (if any) for the labs. Most of the lab is spent on tedious things and you come out frustrated.

2,Trust me!! This man doesnt know how to teach.. I wonder how he got into teaching...isnt very good at explaining things...BAD!!!
5,Fabulous Professor! I highly recommend Prof. Sawyer. She is absoutely the best professor at Middlesex Community College. You will learn so much from her. I have had her for 3 classes and will take anything she teaches. I love her!
5,Ive had for for a few online classes. Her tests are easy  but not too easy. She is very helpful when needed.
5,Excellent Professor! I have taken Prof. Sawyer online and on ground. She is an outstanding professor. I will take every class she teaches. She even goes out of her way to help you succeed.
5,AMAZING is the one word that describes this professor! She is the best of Middlesex!
5,Middlesex Community College is extremely lucky to have such an amazing instructor. Prof. Sawyer is probably the best teacher the college has. She is very thorough  responsive and goes out of her way to help you succeed academically. I must professor to take!!!
5,This professor is probably the best the college has. I took her online and on ground and she is fabulous. Very helpful and will go out of her way to help you. I highly recommend this professor. She is the best!
5,GREAT TEACHER  I WILL STRONGLY RECOMMAND ANY STUDENT TO TAKE HER CLASS.
5,GREAT TEACHER  I WILL STRONGLY ANY STUDENT TO TAKE HER CLASS.
3,Sawyers course makes me sigh. I made the move to more online courses due to the outrageous costs of driving daily  on multiple accounts to campus. I thought I would get the same learning experience. I was wrong. The course can be done without reading a single chapter  nearly all discussions are opinion supported. Tests are even linear to the book!
5,I've had Prof Sawyer three times and all classes were amazingly easy  online classes even more so. Class consists of a weekly discussion that you can answer with your own personal experiences or opinion. We had 5 tests  which all the answers are in order in the book. Easiest A you'll ever get!!
5,I had her for an online class. It was great. Weekly discussion postings pretty much all opinion. A total of 5 tests.. Never read a single chapter. All you have to do is follow the chapter shes testing on with the test its self. All her questions are in order on the book. Incredibly easy teacher  very nice too.
5,Easy A for a traditional campus course. Took her again online the next semester for a different psyce course and she was just as good. Easy A if your willing to put in the time.
4.5,Excellent teacher. Had her for online class. She watches your online activity  strict on due dates and alittle confusing syllabus. If you do the work on time and do all she requires  easy A. I strongly recommend her. Also excellent in responding in emails  giving grades  ect
5,I have had her for three classes  and all three she has been a wonderful professor. She cares about the subject matter  the students  and is up to date with current facts and knowledge. I would highly recommend her. Her tests aren't that hard  and it's easy to pass if you try. I would take another class of hers in a heartbeat.
5,Fabulous professor. I highly recommend her! She is the best!
5,She was awesome...the class was fast paced because it was over the summer  but she really knew what she was talking about...She made sure everyone understood before we moved on...which not many professors do...
5,This is a wonderful teacher. She really cares about her subject! She makes class interesting sharing real life experiences. She also grades very fairly. I recommend her highly!

5,Professor Sawyer is probably the best teacher at the college. She is very thorough and covers all the material so students can understand it. She provides handouts and is extremely helpful to students who need extra assistance. Definitely a professor to take for psychology. She is clearly an asset to Middlesex!
5,BEST TEACHER EVER!!! SAWER IS NOT ONLY A GREAT TEACHER BUT ALSO A GREAT AND GENUINE PERSON--TAKE HER CLASSES YOU WILL BE HAPPY YOU DID!!
5,At first she's intimidating  but once you actually began class she's awesome. Never had a better instructor. She brings in alot of outside content that relates to the work.
4.5,Mrs DeCerbo is a really good teacher. At first I wasn't so sure how I would like her  but she is actually quite funny! You need to be in class to understand some of the topics. She is helpful and brings in some great guest speakers! Love her!
1.5,Absolutely terrible! Yelling at students is not the way to teach students. She also goes off on tangents to rant about her personal life even though it has nothing to do with the class content.
3,People seem to either love or hate her. She knows her psychology  but she tends to lecture/yell at her students  and she didn't know my name until more than half way through the semester. She did bring in some great speakers  though.
5,This is the best professor I have ever had! She is extremely knowledgeable and does everything to give that knowledge to her students. Information I learned there has lasted throughout my entire college career. She is a great friend and cares about the lives of her students both in and out of the classroom. Take her class. It will impact your life.
4,sweet
5,funny
4,good speakers
4.5,had to work knew her stuff
4,knows her stuff makes you work funny cares about humor in the class lots of speakers and videos real life applications
4,She is a very informative teacher who really tries to push her students. The class is tough  but it is worth it. The quizzes and tests are difficult  but that helps teach. She does move through the chapters really quickly  but she does have movies and speakers that help with it.
4.5,Gave out a lot of extra credits. I thought she was pretty easy. But then again I love psychology. =)
1.5,"did not like her at all... you had to do many ""response papers"" that had to be like 900 words or something redic like that.. and you had to go to a nursing home and for a research project.. didn't like it"

2,She seems very on organized imformation on speeches is all over between the internet and the handouts. I often got marked off for not using the write bullet points. Easy class though but don't recommend it.
5,B!
5,This class was a tough one but if you were dedicated and did the work it wasn't too bad. She gave detailed explanations on what you did wrong and how you could improve on projects. She was also very helpful when I came and saw her. She understood my problems with group members and worked with me to fix them. Beware-she will talk your head off!
4.5,She was AWSOME! Her class was very hard but it was rewarding at the end of the semester. She did a lot to help my public speaking. I would reccomend her to any person if they want to better themselves in the area of public speaking.
2,Yes  she is veeeery conservative but the class is not that hard choose well your topics and you'll be fine midterm and final are easy
4,She did a good job teaching the class. The midterms and final were not at all over what she taught in class. Also  I agree with the other people who said that if she disagrees with your topic she knocks your grade down. Don't expect an unbiased grade in this class. If you work hard you should get an A though!
4,She made me laugh.
1,The worst teacher I have ever had in my life! DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH HER!!!!! She grades you wether or not you agree with what she has to say!!!! If you don't like George Bush do not take this class she is big fan and if you give a democratic speech ur gonna be in trouble!

4,YOU HAVE TO READ YOUR TEXTBOOK. YOU HAVE TO STUDY. Fern does as good a job teaching as anyone could do in the limited class time ther is. Take FULL ADVANTAGE of the cheatsheet that is allowed for the tests by typing in size 6 font with formulas and examples and it is CRITICAL to your grade that you ATTEMPT ALL problems of the HW  right or wrong!
1.5,Avoid taking this with 301  you will fail. He's lectures are not very thorough. He doesn't go into detail. You will do homework and be randomly called upon for the homework. He's tests are extremely difficult. Be prepared to teach yourself. (Like all ACC classes at EKU)
5,Extremely helpful- if you are worried about taking Accounting this is the man to take it from.
4.5,High workload. However  homework assigned directly connects to quiz/exam content. If you have a really good case on a bad question he will listen. Like his 322 class the exam questions comes from the textbook publisher and therefore is very picky. You have to read because you get quizzed on reading before you are taught.
1.5,He thinks you need to teach yourself. There were many times a student would ask a question and Dr. Fern would answer then later send an email saying he was wrong about the answer. About 2/3 of the class has a C or lower. I hated him as a teacher. I am going to change colleges because of him because I am an accounting major.
5,"Dr. Fern was a difficult teacher but I learned a lot in his classes (except for individual tax). I don't see how I passed since I failed each exam  but I took my ""C"" and went on to the next class. Don't ever take 322 and 301 together. I failed 301 because of that and the second time around was so much better. I passed it with a ""B""!"
4.5,Definately makes you work  but truly one of the best profs I've had. He really knows his material and enjoys teaching it. He was always willing to help if you were willing to put in the time.
1,Very  very hard professor! He always gives WAY too much homework and made us feel stupid!
4,He does give a lot of work. You have homework problems and group problems that can be very time consuming. I suggest not to take both classes at the same time. He does really care about the students and is very willing to help them learn. He taught me more than any other professor I've ever had. Do the work and pay attention and you'll be fine
4,Definitely works students hard. Lots of Homework and long hand written tests. Will add points back though if you meet with him about your test. Very nice teacher  just wants you to learn.
2,VERYYYY Hard  too much work  had him for a summer class and every night was hours of homework with little help.
1.5,Absolutely the hardest prof. I've had. Very difficult exams. Too bad he is a must-take.
5,Highly intelligent and interesting professor. Be professional and participate as well as willing to learned something. Their is no right or wrong answer  so be involve and have fun doing it. The class will only be as hard as you make it. I will definitely take his class again. Honestly enjoyed every moment while able to take with me some knowledge.
3.5,Makes the subject matter more interesting than many other professors can. Down to earth and understanding professor. Loves to play devil's advocate during open discussions  so don't take his comments personally. Much better class than expected.
4,Professor Hugh very funny and smart man. His class consists of papers only no tests and as long as you put your life experiences and emotions on paper correlating itto the material he will give you a good grade. He is a very easy grader oh no phones in class.
5,Prof. H. Afshari was extrermenly helpful. Vey interesting man to listen to he has seen and been through alot. definetly learn alot in his class.
1,I was really excited coming into this class  but after 2 weeks of listening to Prof. Afshari's rambling and boasting of how amazing he is  my interest in this class dropped immensely. Papers  easy. Discussions  useless. Videos  awesome. He likes to pick on people and argue with them. And god forbid you yawn or say 'um.' Only take him if necessary.
4.5,Professor Afshari is a great person. He was fun  relevant and has an awesome sense of humor. A very wise man who has led an eventful life. We had great discussions after class. I learned a lot from him.
4.5,Very funny. Other people have said it  I'll say it too: Keep an open mind. If you like to argue  you better come VERY prepared! You do learn a lot about his personal history which I found motivating  rather than offending. I learned a lot and would take his class agian.
5,Keep an Open mind.
3,Hugh is hillarious but can be offensive if you are a softy. He is an easy grader and has a healthy sense of self (not modest):)
4,Good professor. Interesting and helpful. He does go off on tangents though  but his stories are good.
3.5,This guy is great! He provoked me to think about things in a way that was uncomfortable  sometimes I wanted to get up and walk out  but that is philosophy in demonstration. Some were put off by his wry sense of humor  but if you are smart enough to figure him out  he is actually hilarious.
1.5,Well  intitially he seemed intelligent and methodical but quickly it changed. With his constant boasting about his IQ and his presitgious status he rarely was able to find time to speak about philosophy. I felt the purpose of the class was to belittle the students and to glorify his self. I strongly recommend not taking any class he teaches!
5,Professor Afshari is very smart! Will study you while you speek and BE CAREFUl  DO NOT TALK IN HIS CLASS!Will hear any little sound. Overall I would take him in future courses.
4,Hugh is a great professor and is easy on grading.
4,Great teacher. He went off on tangents  but they were great stories  and he was a smart man. i'd definately recommend him
3.5,funny teacher... not very clear on what you have to do in class though... i would take him again.
5,Very educated  knowledgable man. The class I had with him was phl100. Good class  I appreciated his professional character!
5,I loved this teacher!A lot of work but well worth it.You'll leave his class wanted to be a better person for you and your kids. He's very intelligent and has had an interesting and eventful life you see only in the movies. Truly a person one aspires tbe.
5,Excellent teacher. Had him for Enviorn. Ethics. Very logical mind. Dry  yet funny sense of humor
5,Great teacher  good sense of humor and really makes you see things from both sides. Prepare to work and do your reading.
3.5,Frampton's classes are very old-fashioned  but he still seems to spark my interest. Just read his chapter before class & you will totally get his referenced  witty jokes.
2.5,Easy teacher  doesn't give any homework or any tests. only gave one because he had to he said. doesn't even read your answer on the test if its long he says. doesn't even pay attention if you show up to class. talks and rambles the whole time. but easy.
3,He's a nice person. Lectures without any powerpoint slides  notes or anything. Gives you scenarios while teaching  but is unclear what will be on the exam. You basically have to teach yourself. Buy the book and read it. You have to in order to pass the class.
1,Frampton was awesome but you basically teach yourself and basically have two tests a final and mid term so don't fail them and its an easy A!
3,lectures the entire time. buy the textbook because you're going to have to make notes and teach yourself
4.5,Yo Frampton is dope  coolest teacher you will ever have. He's so helpful and friendly  probably the best teacher at PhilaU!
4.5,THE MAN.. coolest guy ever. such a nice person and very helpful.
3.5,Great guy. Absolutely hysterical. Keeps class interesting which is a plus if you have an early class. For such a basic  not exactly crazy exciting class  it went pretty smoothly. Definitely recommended.
4.5,Such an easy teacher. You don't even have to go to class just show up for the tests. If you have a picture on your cover page of your papers you'll get an A+. Definitely suggest taking him!
3,Frampton is a great guy  his class is hilarious  and if you actually go to class an pay attention you will learn a lot. His tests are multiple choice  but you have to put time in studying for them. The essays are really easy too  all you need is 3-4 pages and a really nice cover page and you'll get an A.
5,best teacher ive ever had
2.5,Easy class. Attendance is not necessary at all. He talks a lot n makes some jokes  which can be disturbing sometimes  but funny. His test can be hard  but the 3 papers you have to write r a joke. He grades them basically on the appearance of ur cover page. If you want to learn anything about marketing tho  this is not the class.
3.5,I have to comment about his pipe collection as well  he is the man that lives in a pipe. Other than that  don't take him if you want a professor to actually teach you. A typical class starts with him complaining about how poorly his stocks are doing  and then he might call roll  followed by a quick scan of the chapter and maybe he'll draw a picture
3,this guy is def the man. you dont need to go to class but make sure you show up for tests and do the papers. the tests arent that hard since he tells you the essay questions and then the online quizzes help a lot.
5,No Comments
3.5,so easy.. put a nice cover page on your papers  gauranteed A  tests are easy: the multiple choice questions come from the online quizzes and he gives you all the short answer questions in the class before the test. he puts one diagram per test up on the board in class that isnt in the book  so make sure you get it and just write alot on the essays
4,This guy is the man. Go to class when you feel like it...just read the book and do the on-line quizzes before the tests. The papers are a joke too - just make it look nice.
3,It's true  you don't need to go to this class. Everything he teaches in this class isn't on his tests. Just make sure you buy the book simply to use the CD. He uses the tests from the CD and you can get the answers on the CD.
5,Very easy and very cool  always making jokes and keeps the class environment light and casual.
3.5,I'm another student who only casually shows up. I still did well in this class. He is quite funny  he gives out As on papers like it's going out of style  and you actually can learn things if you show up and pay attention. You do have to show up for surprise quizzes to get an A  but they're easy.
5,DDHT 459 was the best class I've ever taken. I enjoyed him in 218 as well.
5,Best professor at Queen's. Hands down.
3,Soft spoken  confusing  and not so much tech savvy interns of lecture presenting and lecture recording.
2,He is very boring  soft spoken and likes to ramble. He talks so slowly yet quickly that it's hard to decipher the gibberish that he speaks. His slides are not great either. Keep your studies to the textbook.
3.5,alright prof  he speaks softly so sit closer to him. pretty boring but his exam is fair. i did alright on his section  he gets 30 questions (15 x 2 weeks teaching). i read textbook for his section as his notes arent fantastic
3,Very nice prof with a warm  shy smile. I hope he talks louder and clearer. I am not a native English speaker  and have no idea what he talks about 80% of the time. He does try to be funny as I can see my classmates laugh from time to time - but since I don't understand him I don't know what they are laughing about. :P
3,Really nice guy. Not the clearest professor  but a good guy.
5,definetly one of the most helpful professors I've ever had
4,He got carried away talking about Mullis so many times. Nice guy though.
3.5,He cares about students. He is the best prof in the department of biochem
5,So great. Nice  helpful  interesting...need more like him
5,No Comments
5,Great prof and a super guy. Wish I did my PhD with him instead!
5,Best prof ever... will bump up your mark for med school
4,Cool prof and very fair!
5,very approachable and willing to help
4.5,he actually cares
5,This prof is the nicest guy
4.5,cool and funny guy
5,One of few profs here who actually tries to get students to enjoy the class.
5,Dr. F is the best!! He cares for each and every student that is sitting in front of him. He has been so helpful to me throughout my stint here at EKU. He has been with me every step of the way. He was also my adviser. If you want to learn from the best  take Dr. F. He really is awesome!
5,Dr. Ferguson is also my advisor. He is one of the best  if not THE best  teachers I've ever had in my life - not because of the content he taught me  but because of the life lessons. He cares about his students more than we care about ourselves sometimes. If you don't love PE  I'm sure you will after just a few conversations with him. Love him.
1,This mas has been teaching the same way for the last 30 years and hasn't changed a thing during his time at EKU. Once he hates you  he will ALWAYS hate you. Don't get on his bad side. There is one way to learn in his mind and that is HIS way. To stay awake in his class is a true challenge. It's time to hang it up Dr. Ferguson.
4.5,Very nice professor and a super easy class! You can take this class for two weeks in the summer. We did an instant activity  notebook  and peer teaching  and class was fun. Everyone got an A!
2,Complete ****. He picks a favorite in the class and hates everyone else. Would not recommend him unless he already loves you.
5,Dr. Ferguson is a great teacher! He really acts like he cares about the students and is always willing to help. Class is easy. Try to take it in the summer  they offer a two week class with no tests. Super easy!
5,Dr. Ferguson is an awesome teacher. He knows his stuff and he makes his class very fun. Assingments are easy and he is very clear. Tests are easy if you look over notes. No book was required. He was the best teacher I have had yet. I hated to see this class end! If would love it if all classes were this way!!!
5,One of the sweetest people I've ever met! Know his stuff  fun and enthusiastic. Great teacher!
5,I loved this class. One of my favorites so far. He is a great teacher and person. Assignments aren't bad and there aren't tests. He is very nice and easy to get along with.
5,Great teacher! Knows his material and is extremely intelligent! I HIGHLY reccomend him!
5,No Comments
5,Wonderful teacher! This class is very fun! I would recommend him to anyone!
5,I loved this class! It was a lot of fun and not a lot of BS busy work other teahcers give you.
2.5,Not a fair grader. Shows a lot of bias.
5,Excellent teacher. Very fun.
5,I really have to contradict the earlier posting. I don't think the person was actually writing about Gessner. She does teach. She does not read things verbatim from the textbook!!! She is very interesting and kept her students engaged and interested. Moreover  she was the best instructor I had this semester.
5,I really enjoyed her class. She explained things clearly and efficiently. She is very approachable  and would even see me when there wasn't an office hour available. I didn't find her exams easy  but I feel that we were well prepared for them. I think UVic is extremely lucky to have her!
4.5,Great teacher. Very calm  clear  and approachable. She is very helpful and makes herself available for students who have questions. All in all a good experience.
1,Does not teach. Reads things things verbatim from the text book. Does not elaborate at all Explainations seem to consistantly be circular. Does nothing to hold students interest. It is absolutely painful having to sit through her class. I would not wish this professor on anyone. Hands down  the WORST instructor I have ever had. Easy tests etc.
5,Does an excellent job of explaining concepts  is approachable and is always very clear about what she wants done on assignments. Also knows how to pick good TAs! Awesome prof  awesome class :D
5,Very clear teacher  very calm. She conveys all the material in a straightforward manner. She is approachable and open to questions. She doesn't show a lot of passion for her subject  but she certainly does a very good job teaching it.
5,Great teacher! I loved this class . . . there were a few topics she went through a little quickly  but other than that she was very easy to understand.
5,A great teacher  very clear  straightforward  and fair.
5,Very nice person  helpful  kind  concerned.Good teacher  cool !
5,knows her stuff  very clear on what is expected  very willing to help and very approachable. two thumbs up!

4.5,I really enjoyed taking this class. You have to do the readings but he is very clear with what will be in the exams regarding lecture and what wasn't covered in class. Interesting approach to adult development. He has 3 or 4 random days in which he will take attendance  I recommend going to all lectures regardless (they are very interesting).
4.5,Lectures are interesting  his tests are very straightforward  and the homework is minimal. Great professor and if you show up to class  pay attention  and read the textbook  his class should be a breeze. No surprises with him.
5,mixes up of materials and mediums used to express material...he's absolutely fabulous & attentive to the needs of the students...workload is just right and he provides support that is necessary through out the class...he asks in the middle of the lecture if everything makes sense and provides time questions...best professor at smith hands down!
5,EXCELLENT PROFESSOR! Organized  test was comprehensive if you followed along in lectures  experiments were fun and assignments went along with the class. He is very accessible and office hours are great! He was very nice and made a point of trying to get to know everyone's name the first day of class. Lab reports were long  but facilitated learning
5,Great professor! Lectures are organized and assignments are clear.
5,One of the best psych professors at Smith. He is organized and engaged and always willing to meet with students. His lectures and assignments are clear and organized so it is easy to study for his exams. I never wanted to miss a class!
5,He is amazing!!! The lectures are really interesting  the material diverse  and he really makes you engaged in the material. he is super helpful and flexible about papers etc- you can tell he cares about the students. if you take good notes and read the coursepack the tests will be easy. dont read the text book  its boring.
5,great  friendly  organized professor. really enjoyed his class
5,peterson is a great lecturer and is very aproachable. he really wants his students to succeed. i would definitely take this class if you can squeeze it in.
4,Pretty good  interesting class. I have pretty ambivalent feelings towards his lecturing style - seemed a little too scripted at times  which I didn't like  but the lectures were very organized
5,adult development is seriously a wonderful class. i wish i had enough time to take all his classes!
5,i loved him so much. hes so great and approachable. fair grader
5,Great professor. Very good lecturer. Very fair grader.
5,No Comments
4.5,Really friendly  good lecturer  and interesting.
4.5,Very intelligent
5,Enthusiastic and friendly.
5,He's a great lecturer  very clear and interesting. Also really friendly.
2.5,Unfair
3.5,liked how he allows us to do creative responses to the novels. found him very approachable and his lectures engaging and not boring at all  (especially because he's actually interested in the subject himself and conveys that to his students).
2.5,Really  really dislike Paulo. Ego takes up entire lecture hall. Jokes around at students expense all class. Read Arabian Nights (wonderful material) however he wouldn't give more than a C to anyone who mentioned gender/sexism in any of their work (should be valid in arabian nights  as almost all women are ****s...) Picks favs.. Very unfair. AVOID!
1.5,You go to class to hear the same lecture worded differently. Discussions on (fairly easy) books simply touch the surface and nothing is in-depth. I think he's stupid although he acts like he's well-read and intelligent. I hope he gets fired. All you need to know is WL=lit read across the globe. I just saved you tons of $$ and time. You're welcome.
5,Great Course! One of the best Professors at SFU. I also took WL 100 and was enjoyed it a lot  might major in WL!
5,After 2 semester w/ Paulo I've decided to major in WL. I have never met such a dedicated prof who is so passionate about what he teaches that students automatically become engaged in discussions. I don't understand the nasty comments about him cause in the 2semesters that I've had him none of the students in my classes ever felt that way about him.
5,This was a fantastic class. Paulo knows the material through and through and is willing to give you the help you need. I would take this class again in a second.
1,Prof. Horta is mean spirited. His jokes are often not in good fun and he puts down students indirectly
1,Horta is a nightmare! The syllabus is good but he manages to make you hate coming to class as they are excruciating and boring as hell. He blabbers on incoherently about everything else but the books  flirst with students and gets most of his facts wrong.He doesn't teach  just parades his ego. Although an easy class  avoid if you value your sanity!
5,loved reading DQ and other books  I mean Quixote... great course and excellent instructor.
1,i did not enjoy the teaching of the instrucotr  horta
5,I can only speak to the Arabian Nights course -- the best course I have taken so far at SFU. The enthusiasm and passion were contagious. There was no exam but only a journal of responses instead -- everyone was into it
5,this guy's a softie -- you'd pretty much have to skip class  not do readings  and not show up to the final to get into trouble.
1,horrible! i did not like this prof  horta  but course was neat.
1.5,he is an okay prof. he marks way too hard. he is pretty arrogant. i found his course too dificult. i am a good student.
5,great prof  too bad he got promoted and is gone!
1,Worst prof at SFU. I totally had a hard time listening to his bordenline-estoteric lectures and bearing with his ego! Luis Paulo Lemos Horta is not a cool prof!
5,fabulous  take anything from this guy. A pretty fair marker. Showing up to class and doing the readings does seem to be a pre-req to doing well  though.
1,Took the trickster and arabian nights courses while back. the prof was horrible. he does not know how to relate to other people. he marked us way too hard and made us read way to much. he borrowed money from students! and he totally played favourites.
5,my first thought was  a 900 page novel? you gotta be kidding. I'm in 4th year and noone ever asked me to read a book this long. But I loved Don Quixote & other books-- prof rides you hard so you expect a tough marker but he's actually a softie when you get your marks back
1,The WORST professor I have ever had. Arrogant  and disrespectful to students. Have a question? Don't bother asking  she will tell you to just rewatch her video lesson. Her quiz questions feel like she's just trying to trick you and make you second guess yourself. Organization of assignments in blackboard
1,AWFUL
1,disrespectful towards students when you ask her a simple question. Goes way too fast in lectures and does an awful job preparing you for quizzes. DO NOT TAKE HER.
1,Very Rude. Treats you like a child because she thinks grad students are superior. Class isnt that hard but take another professor if possible.
1,This class about killed me. Seriously  this was an online class and there was no routine  she refused to answer questions  and she always tried to confuse students on the quizzes. You can listen to the lectures 20 times  do all the practice problems correctly  then get to the test and be like what the crap is she talking about.
4,This is a hard class. I don't know that I could've done as well with a different type of instructor. Dr. Mills' lectures are clear and easy to understand  she gives you tons of practice problems that are similar to the graded quizzes and assignments. Don't get overwhelmed  take it week by week. Watch the lectures and do the work. Proud of my A!
1,You are grad students your not in kindergarten. She is full of herself rude and refuses to answer questions when directly asked instead she says put it on the discussion board so your class mates can answer it I pay to have an instructor if I wanted to teach myself I would by a book do the work and ask friends if they understood for free
1.5,"This class is the biggest waste of my time possible. Unless you will copy information  word for word for her ""examples"" you will not do well. This is the only place that you can get a hundred on a quiz and score a C on a discussion post!"
1.5,Will not provide any assistance when needed. She comes across as very arrogant and can frankly  quite rude. She does not understand that this class is an online environment and dealing with numbers online can be tricky. The fact that all of her ratings are negative--speak volumes. Please be mindful of this when taking BER 540!
1,She makes one mistake per minute on her videos. What a waste of space. Extremely rude and full of herself. Don't plan to learn anything.
1.5,Most of this class is online. If you take the in-class version  it's still mostly online. Work is hard  but she is enthusiastic about it and doesn't understand that we don't share her passion. I will avoid taking any more classes from her  although I worked my butt off and got an A.
1,She is indeed a very pompous lady whose class has absolutely NOTHING to do with the use of statistics in education. If you want to figure the average number of tissues per box and can meet each of her tedious mandates for posting assignments you will pass. She is not open to communication and is highly judgemental.
1,Has anyone mentioned what a waste of breath she is as an instructor. She has no idea what she is doing  is arrogant and pompous for no reason and needs to go back and take STATS again herself!
1.5,Avoid her classes if at all possible. I took her ANOVA class and made an A  yet I can tell you NOTHING about how to do ANOVA. Try to take the STATS classes in the Psych dept or with Godfrey instead.
1,What a waste of time. I could have taken this online class without an instructor. Made an A  but definitely had nothing to do with her teaching. Thank God I had old stats textbooks to rely on!
1,More focused on if students can correctly post comments in a web-based class than teaching statistics.
1.5,Glad she's hot-wish she could teach!
4,Extremely Hot
3,damn fine
5,I really enjoyed my class. Tim was very helpfull and the guidlines were clear. Wish I could have him for my next english class.
4,He seems really rude and arrogant in class  but he is a good professor  and I learned a lot. The class was interesting  even though I did not think I would like it at all. I would encourage anyone to take this professor  he really wants you to do well  but expects you to earn it.
3,He seems arrogant and hard  but he's really kind hearted. He understands things  and is pretty forgiving for being late on assignments. He lets you resubmit when you make mistakes  and if you go to class you'll actually learn some things. He is a pretty good teacher. He jams a lot of homework into one time frame  but it's all repetitive...
1,I thought he was arrogant.
4.5,People told me their English 300 classes were a waste of time  but this class was not like that at all. I learned a lot of useful information about different writing assignments. The instructor explains how to do an assginment  and he answers all questions until you know what he wants. I recommend Inman because he cares about what you are learning.
3,Easy class  easy A...but I actually learned a lot. It introduces you to writing resumes and internal memos and such  I'm even keeping the book because I find it so helpful  it will come in handy. Not a lot of assn's..most easy. Good prof  nice guy  but he can go on and on talking about every detail of everything. Overall  good!
5,TAKE THIS CLASS! There are quite a few writing assignments  but you have a ton of time to do them. If you do the work  you'll get a good grade. Inman is helpful when you have questions  and he is definately not a hard grader. I got an A with minimal effort. Also  this class does teach important stuff for the future
5,Tim is a great teacher and is very easy going. He will work with you in any situation to make sure you do well. The only way to fail is by attempting to fail. If you breath and listen you should do well
4.5,He is good professor. His assignments are not easy  but these are very helpful for your future. if you need to take eng300  I recommend him.
5,If you need to take this course  this is the guy to take. If you have decent writing skills you shouldn't have any problems getting an easy A. There is also extra credit so that makes it even more possible. I have witnessed the alternative Professors for this course  and Inman is the best choice.
3,way to much out of class work. Make sure your computer works because you will need it to do six papers and little assignments.
5,Inman is very easygoing and this is a great class. Assignments are not too difficult and tests are open book. I would strongly reccommend him!
3,He is confusing.
2.5,He's clearly very intelligent  but the bar is set far too high for an intro-level class. The use of the online practice modules feels like tacked-on busy work to fill time. Papers come with unrealistic expectations and without discussion about due dates (that he said we would discuss in the future). Would not recommend  especially for new students
2,Mr Meany is mean. He is opinionated and quiet sarcastic. However  he knows his stuff. He can be a great teacher if you and him share the same ideas BUT if you don't then it's going to be a nightmare
2.5,His course is pretty difficult. Probably not the greatest teacher I've ever had. He can go off on a tangent that can definitely come off as self-indulgent. BUT  if you're a college student  you're going to get professors like that  and he's probably a good start in preparing for those sorts. Also it's pretty funny.
4.5,I would be lying if I said he was easy. But his personality is the besy! He hates kids  which will become apparent through his sarcasm and comments. He is a genius. And I personally think he is very attractive. As for papers  be prepared to cry and know your topic won't pass him off before you pick it. But if you get on his good side he will help!
1,DO NOT HAVE CLASS WITH THIS PROFESSOR! He will tell you to follow the writing guide and mark you off for doing it. If you have your own opinion on a reading and it is not like his  you will be wrong. He insults students in front of the other students and acts like he is better than everyone else. First words out of his mouth is no one makes an A.
2.5,"DO NOT TAKE. NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY OR HOW GOOD OF A WRITER YOU ARE YOU STIL WILL GET A ""C"". HE REALLY SUCKS AND IS MEAN FOR ABSOLUTELY NO REASON."
3,He is not the easiest person. He basically just want you to follow and learn from his guidelines. The class discussions can be interesting If you want to make it. He listens to his students. If you're really lazy or sensitive and striving for an A or B i wouldn't recommend.
2,He is not sensitive to student's medical issues. Don't miss this class  even if you're on your death bed. You will loose all class participation. He's a very tough grader. He never gives A's to students. It's highly unlikely  so consider a B an A in his class.
3,He is Mr. Ryan for me  he is not an easy proffesor but he keeps us working hard and making us give our best. When i thought i was getting an A i just got a D and that made me focus more and be more perseverant. Not an easy proffesor but.... he is Mr Ryan
2,Meany is a tough  opinionated teacher. If you don't have the same mind set or agree with his answers he will argue with you until you force to give in. Knows what he's talking about  but is a miserable person. He converses with you based on his knowledge  therefore he's often difficult to understand. He's my least favorite teacher I've ever had.
3,He was very mean to me... I worked very hard but he gave me an C.
4.5,Very blunt teacher however he is hilarious. At first he comes of as a self centered person but after two weeks you get used to him. I recommend taking any class he teaches.
4,Interesting professor who will tell you how it is. He is a pretty tough grader  but that's the way it should be in order to learn. Class discussions were interesting and very helpful
5,He is blunt and tells you straight up  class discussions have taught me more about life than anything else. He pushes you to your limits and you will benefit from this class.
3.5,He's honestly an awesome teacher. Especially if you're actually interested in English. He's got good insight and makes class fun and interesting. He comments on things like a normal person and not an uptight teacher. Would rather you write papers in your voice. Not an easy A  you have to be a little into it. But i would recommend him.
5,Expects a lot of his students and is very helpful and honest with critiques. Gives compliments when deserved and encourages students who make an effort to improve. Very fair and sensitive.
3,Start of the class was bad  he is very into his own ideas and not the ideas of others. However as the class went on I learned things and he started to listen to me and others. Papers are graded hard with little feedback and he is not the most helpful person with essay questions. If you want to read some good stuff and learn take this professor.
5,I took Professor Meany for Compostion and Rhetoric II and although I had taken the class before (I transferred into the University...credit mixup) he managed to make it challenging for me (in the best way possible.) He is a great guy and will help you as much as you need  but expects your very best work. Pay attention and you will learn A LOT.
2,Classes are really boring all you do is discuss the readings the whole class time. He is an okay guy but hes not really willing to help you with your essay  he just tells you to go to the writing center. Hes a tough grader  but hes an ok guy.
5,Meany is the best! FYW 101 is difficult but worth it. If you work hard you will earn the grade you deserve  analysis is very important and he helps you learn to dig deeper in reading and writing to a level you never thought was possible. Best class if you want to learn  but if you are looking for an easy A snooze course this isn't it.
5,Chaney was an absolute ray of sunshine! His Film 100 class is fun and chill. I had him for an 8am and every morning he made waking up for that class a little bit easier. We only had two projects and spent a lot of time talking about and watching films. He loves when people talk in his class and he is very excited about what he does!
5,Absolutely loved Prof Chaney! He's super hilarious  and he knows what he's talking about within the film industry. Do your work and you will get an A! There's two film individual projects ( midterm and final )  so it's not bad! He loves when people participate and talk in the class though not many talked in our class (maybe because it was an 8 am?)
5,chaney is amazing!! had him for an 8am on a monday and he made it totally bearable! he is hilarious and gives you a lot of creative freedom! take him !!
3.5,Chaney is super cool! Took him for intro to screenwriting. He's relatable and understands his students. He's really good with feedback on your scripts. Sometimes he can get distracted easily and it can be annoying but his distractions make class interesting! Would totally take him again!
5,He's probably my favorite professor at SCAD! He knows what he is talking about and is very helpful and is great with his critiques. He tells lots of stories  sometimes they're relevant  sometimes not. I would definitely take his class again!
5,Professor Chaney was such a delightful professor! His projects were considerably flexible  and he's super honest when giving critique. Despite being an 8 AM  his class was super enjoyable. Such a fun guy all around. Take him!
4,He DEFIANTLY plays favorites. He will love and defend his Film major students and practically brush off other majors. However  he's worth it. I took him at 8 in the morning and he had so much energy! You just have to take his comments with a grain of salt.
4,Chaney was awesome! He really cared about his students and was very encouraging  even of films that other teachers may not have supported so much. He was also just a really cool guy and gave great projects.
4,Chaney is the best! He won't restrict your ideas on projects and always offers great feedback. His class was fun and enjoyable  even though it was at 8am. He really knows how to engage the class and get everyone talking. If you can get in  definitely take him!
3,Great guy  loves film which is so important. Allows creativity and changes deadlines to ensure good product.
1,Great
5,Chaney kicks ass! He is totally into his students and their films and will bend over backwards to make sure you get what you need to make your film happen! If you're lucky enough to get into his class  cherish it!
5,The Best Senior Project Prof. And the hardest to get. He has tons of knowledge.
5,Brilliant.
5,As previously mention: Knows his stuff. Admits when he is stumped. An all around cool guy. Care greatly for his student's well being. A MUST TAKE!
5,I have never met someone with so much knowledge in film production who isn't bull****ing me. A real cool guy.
5,AWESOME!!!
5,"Took an online class. Pretty easy sinceCollege Algebra is mostly same as high school algebra. Used videos on ConnectMath as review and made easy A's. There's a lot of homework  but discussions are easy. It was just roll call or saying something like ""I understand ______."""
5,This class is not easy. So much work in ConnectMath  it's insane! But! Professor Gutliph is great! He knows you have lots of work to do  and he tries to help you and make it easier on you as much as he can. For example  his discussions are easy  and he gives a great review for your Midterm and Final exam! Definitely recommend!
4,No matter what professor you take on-line  it's a self-teaching class. ConnectMath doesn't have any mercy on students. Load work is insane. We had About 25 videos to watch  about 80 questions homework and 2 hour quiz each week. It's not a multiple choice. Professor Gutliph gave us a great Midterm review. Will take him again.
5,I would highly recommend Mr. Gutliph. There is a lot of work in connect math  and it can be very time consuming  so be prepared to do the homework. If I have the opportunity to attend one of his classes in the future I will. He is a great professor  and actually cares that you pass his class.
2.5,I took this class online in the fall. It is basically self-teaching  and I fell behind. Everything is on a e-book  homework  quizzes  ect. He doesn't teach anything  you teach yourself. LOTTS of hw  you'll find yourself behind. I failed the class
5,If youre thinking of taking Gutliph  do it! For an online class  he is extremely helpful and interacts with his students. He grades fairly  doesn't overload with too much homework  and prepares for tests. He is super helpful and has good taste in music as well which makes him all the more awesome. Take him  you will not regret it one bit.
3,Math 2420 or discrete math is not an easy class and it is much harder online. Dr. Gutliph was the first to put this class online and I struggled until the end. I suppose the course will get refined and better but It is so NOT an easy A. My class found plenty of online videos I am sure he will share with the next classes. Overall he is a fair grader
5,Everything is on WebAssign (homeworkquizzes) except for the midtermfinal so make sure to get it. The ebook comes with WebAssign so you don't really need the actual book. I fell a little behind in his class  but caught up and passed with an A. Good luck. He's really laid back and a great teacher! You won't regret taking him. :-D
5,Mr. G is one of a kind. He is very straight forward  a clear communicator and very responsive and helpful. His videos are awesome. He's hilarious  has great taste in music and is interested in the success of each of his students. Highly recommended  so much so  took a second class and will take another with him as well.
4,I've had Mr. G for several online math classes. He's the best when it comes to online math courses at GPC. His video lectures are clear and he's very fashionable. If you have a question  he responds to email promptly. A+ teacher.
5,I took this class online and passed with a B. You do have to put in the work but the professor is the best. Just make sure you keep up with your weekly assignments and quizzes. He provides study guides for both mid-term and final. You need only to buy the code for the book.
5,I need this class  how much is the midterm and final worth? Does his study guides prepare for exams. This will be my second attempt. Is he really helpful? Is there book homework or only web-assign work. Does he allow use of electronic help  mathway  and other calculators??
5,He's awesome. Take him! Lot's of homework but he is willing to help all the time.
5,Mr. Gutliph is a great professor that wants all of his students to succeed. This is not an easy class by any means  but it's doable. There are two homework assignments & a quiz every week  but he gives you the entire semester to turn them in. DO THEM WEEKLY! Don't fall behind! He gives u a midterm & final study guide with every question you'll need
5,Let me start by saying this is not an easy class. You will have tons of homework to do each week. That being said I think almost all Algebra classes have the same work. Mr. G is a good guy and wants people to pass. If you do the homework and study his review you will be fine. May not get an A  but you will pass. I would recommend himxe2x80xa6
4.5,Great Professor! Math isn't my subject but I did great in his class. Took him in the summer so I had to cram a lot into about 8 weeks. He provides a lot of resources for help and responds fast. Great math professor !
5,The best math teacher hands down!! I took him for math 1111 and math 1113 and always had the mindset that I was going to fail cause I'm so bad with math. But he made everything different  very helpful! You would need to make a lot of time for his class but worth taking! Take him! You won't regret it!
4,Very nice professor. Answers emails promptly. However  doesnt have chat hours which is really hard to deal with especially for a math course. Otherwise everything is with webassign. Not so bad  I would recommend him!
4.5,GREAT TEACHER. Must be dedicated to getting assignments in on time. He gives fair chances and is always willing to help! Definitely take his class!
5,James Dayglow is an absolute legend.
4,Honestly people... his accent is hot  yes  but he's just an average guy. Besides he's married! His three hour classes seem to drag... not like it matters much though he's not going to be here after this semester... he's going back to his island abode.
5,Excellent class. Great teacher.
5,Medieval history was BORING...but very easy. I skipped all the time and got an A. He's a fun guy though. If you want to interact with him more take his 505 class. His accent rocks and he loves to talk about English modern culture.
5,Excellent class and helpful with material presented. Very enthusiastic about women's letter writing.
1,terrible  likes himself too much.
5,Great Professor. V. interesting class. Best prof at CMU!
4.5,lectures are boring  but you can still get an A if you sleep through them... but at times he is very interesting and funny
1,very boring
2,No Comments
4,He is an intresting prof  but his lectures are boring. However the class is pretty easy if you do the work  which is not much. He understand students lives which is nice
5,Lectures a lot  but he knows what he's talking about. Classes were fun  and he's an extremely fair grader. No tests  but expect to write several papers. Not too hard though  I'd reccomend it to anyone. Great professor.
5,great prof  very interesting  cute  just love the accent
5,Take this class!! This professor really knows his stuff inside out. Great lecturing style  very helpful  and a genuinely nice guy. He's also really hot!!!!!
3.5,hes a really nice guy and lets you redo papers and really wants his students to do well. Gives you all the information you need to do your assignments. Your grade is basically on a couple papers. His lectures are pretty boring though but you dont need to go to them.
3,Terrible teacher. Unorganized  boring  and hung up on his own ego. He made an interesting subject completely unbearable. As a history major  I learned nothing.
5,He's simply the sultan's delight....
5,This class is very interesting  and the professor knows a lot about the period. Be sure to do the reading!
1,boring
5,This guy really knows his stuff. Take this class. Great accent!!
4,Geez  that guy left the Art Institute over 4 years ago. I heard that he had heart trouble and died. Dude  let him go. He was an OK Sociology teacher  but his expertise was in Video.
3,when he lectured  it was clear... during his critiques you were ripped apart if you did something slightly off or what you thought (at the time) was funny. He plays favorites though  if anybody ever played favorites it was him. And  wouldn't you know  he always only wanted to give help ONLY to the skinny white chicks...
4.5,Bill is one of the coolest teachers ever. He helped me find freelance work while I was still going to school. I've used many of the things he taught me on my last game title Advent Rising  and techniques I'm currently using on King Kong here at Weta Digi
4,This guy is pretty cool! I nice guy in general but also teaches a really fun class. I enjoyed learning all the video editing equipment and Premiere. I also had tons of fun shooting videos with my group!
1,No good. Has no idea what he is teaching. He is also **** and discriminative to gays. Didnt he get fired?
1.5,Doesnt know much about the subjects he teaches. Tends to go on long drawn out tangents that lead nowhere. People only like him for the amazing ease of his classses. take a class with him  throw your money away.
5,very cool guy  he made class interesting and really taught me alot. Good sense of humor and if you have a problem or need extra help  do not hesitate to ask he is totally there to help.
5,No Comments
5,Cool guy for a grandpa
4.5,No Comments
4,I enjoyed the class and teacher. As most History majors  there is addendai reading to be done. Great teacer and am glad I had him in class.
4.5,Lectures are long but he is so passionate about his subject! Dr. Haynie is such a kind person and he LOVES what he does. Test are easy and he will give you extra credit if you don't miss any class.
4.5,Super easy class  studied an hour before tests and got A's. Great guy and knows a lot about history! However I hope you like lectures... they are super long!!
5,His class is really easy to pass. His study guides are usually around 120 questions long but they're all on quizlet so you really have nothing to worry about. If you study the quizlet  you'll pass his tests.
5,He was a great professor really knows his stuff. He absolutely loves the Civil War and is very fond of it. Highly Reccomended!
4.5,Haynie's class was very easy. Tests straightforward and right off the study guide. Slightly boring at times  but his demonstration of what a curtsey is made my semester!
5,Class is pretty much exactly the same every day. However  he talks about the material like its a campfire story. Very knowledgeable and kind. His tests are incredibly straight forward. HIghly recommend.
5,Do not leave Harding without taking this man for at least one class. If you get the chance for an elective  I highly recommend his Civil War class. He's very passionate about what he teaches  and the field trip is great.
5,A true historian in every sense of the word. He made the history come to life....power point slides and stories of a personal nature that glued me to my seat. Considered changing my major from Bible to History.....great Professor
4.5,I had from 1492-Civil War  and though it was occasionally boring  it was still a good class. If you fill out the study guides then you will ACE the tests and the states/capitals test is easy as long as you know the info. He has fascinating stories to tell that add interest to the class. He taught a class on Revelation at my Church  and I LOVED it!
4,Classes are boring  but all the Powrpoint presentations done in class are also available online. His tests are DIRECTLY off of the study guides (word-for-word)  and there are no assignments outside of class. Extra credit is easy to recieve as wll.
4.5,i have dr. haynie for both american history and western civ right now. i absolutely love his class! somedays it's boring  but other days it's way interesting. i would recommend him to anyone. he puts all the powerpoints online and you print off the study guide. word for word questions on study guide as the test. EASY. love it!
4,He never gave us study guides  and there is no textbook. The tests are not really on what he teaches. He tells us silly random stories that have no historical significance (they're still fun facts  but knowing them won't get you a good grade). He's really funny and nice  and if you don't miss a class he lets you skip on the exam 
5,Dr. Haynie is the best teacher I have ever had. He's a big part of why I became a teacher. He really brought the subjects to life  and I strive to do that for my students.
3.5,Very boring  but what history class isn't? The study guide gave you the answers for the test  you just have to memorize it. Not bad  just sort of mediocre.
1,ugh
1,Haynie is easier than most of my high school teachers. A nice man  but not in any way challenging or worthy of collegiate teaching.
4,Haynie is awesome. He can get boring in class if you are not interested in what he is talking about. He is very focused on his teaching. Everyone else saying that his tests are his study guides...they are absolutly right. Getting an A in his class is easy if you show up.
5,Dr Haynie is fantastic. One of the few teachers that is truly passionate about what he teaches. Very interesting & willing to help you with whatever he can.
5,One of my favorite teachers  because he absolutely LOVES what he's teaching! I tend to fall asleep during other teacher's lectures  but not Dr. Haynie's. Well...at least not not NEAR as much!
5,This teacher offers colleagues and classmates to take time to discuss their literary preferences and campus activity. gREAT writ and teacher. I recommend.
4.5,She is a great teacher! Willing to help and not to mention super easy class. She lets you leave class 10 minutes early which is nice and she helps a lot with clarifying the prompt! AMAZING TEACHER. TAKE HER.
5,Easy. Funny. Getting ready to retire so really lenient on things. Great class.
4.5,I Love Mrs Haynie! She is probably the funniest teacher I have had yet! She is so quirky! Her world lit class was one of my favorite classes.No textbook  just a study packet she has put together herself.Her test expectations are clear and she makes literature very interesting! Take this class!!
5,She is by far the best teacher I've had at Harding. Her classes are always interesting and she is very helpful when it comes to the tests. I was dreading taking a lit class but it's my favorite class of the semester.
5,One of the best teachers at Harding. She's passionate about teaching and easily keeps your attention. Truly cares about her students and their ability to do well  not only in her class  but life in general.
5,Wonderful woman! Very funny. Highly recommend for World Lit! Reading is minimal and test expectations are clear.
4,The best class I have taken at Harding. I went in dreading another English class but loved this class. She is so much fun and I had a great time. I have recommended this class to some many people.
4.5,I loved this class. She is my favorite teacher ever. I am taking her next semester as well. She is always open for help and gives us more time if we need it. She is a little silly but that is what keeps us laughing. It is my favorite class to go to! :)
5,Her class is a little bit of a challenge  lots of memorization  BUT she is the coolest teacher. She makes class enjoyable and humorous most of the time. She even plays movies of some of the stories :]
2,If you don't miss a single class than you don't have to take the final... if its excused she doesn't give a flip so just go
5,Easiest class i have ever taken. This lady is so funny and engaging that i never even thought of skipping until i completed the course work about 2 weeks before midterms. I would defiantly recommend this class or any class she teaches for that matter!
5,What an amazing teacher! She presents the info clearly and makes sure everyday is fun! Never a boring day in her class. Predictable tests and not an overwhelming amount of information.
5,THE MOST AMAZING TEACHER EVER...I mean  who will wanna go to an 8 am literature class?? ME  cuz she is amazing!! I always look forward to go to class!!! Luv ya Mrs. Haynie
5,This lady is amazing. She's the most accommodating professor ever  sometimes to the point of being a little too easy on her students. However  at the same time  she provokes students to participate in very intellectual thought and conversation. I highly recommend her.
5,Haynie's class is amazing. We have some deep discussions sometimes and it is interesting. We also missed alot of classes and got out early often. Reading material is very interesting too. This was an awesome class. Recommended A+
5,Mrs. Haynie is probably one of my favorite professors in life. She is still  to this day  a good friend and a mentor to me. I love her and her classes were awesome.
5,Mrs. Haynie is one of my favorite teachers ever. She really makes the subject interesting  she cares about her students  and she's very helpful with students who need extra help and teaching more proficient students new skills.
5,She is one of if not best teachers I have ever had!She is so amazing and awesome! She gets her points across gwell  keeps you interested and if you struggling she will help you go over assignments with you so you don't get a bad grade on it. If you do every thing she tells you in class with at least 80% effort you should no lower than a -B!
5,Oh my  I only have good things to say about her class. I was dreading comp II  but she made is soooo enjoyable...TAKE HER!! I have always HATED writing and all that kind of stuff  but she made is relatively fun for me! AND I got a good grade!
4,I took her at NYU. The class was incredibly interesting. The hw assignments were thorough  but really helped you understand the material. She knows what she's talking about and really wants the students to learn  and will explain things until everyone gets it. She allowed us to determine exam and essay formats and we made up our own final questions
4,she's so passionate about the course and it really shows which definitely helped me stop being bitter about having to take this to graduate. the paper really isn't that hard and the weekly quizzes make it easy to know where you stand in the course. I highly recommend her.
4,really cool teacher. she is very passionate about the subject and her class is somewhat enjoyable. her grading is difficult but if you put time into it she will give you a good grade
3,lots of reading but it's nice because there are weekly quizzes instead of tests. you can tell she is passionate about the subject. she's a cool gal
4,Tests are opening book and gives out questions ahead of time  if you prepare  you'll do great. Very understanding of life out of class.
1,10 page paper from hell...she is very biased and if she hates you she'll give you a bad great. dont waste your time in this class.
1.5,Took this course expecting it to be about Women and Religion in Ancient World as the title suggests  and yet somehow have found myself in an archeology course. Unless you're into that sort of thing  I'd rather be watching paint dry. It's a disgustingly easy course but she's a flake.This was for a gender studies minor & I learned about ancient pots.
5,She is a great archeologist and she a great teacher. Her class is not hard AT ALL. Very funny and extremely caring. The quizes are every friday to review for the week and she drops the lowest grade. You play jeopardy for extra credit!! She puts underlying theory to practice lol. Take her class!!!
4.5,Great teacher.She is very respectful toward faith when compared with other theology teachers. Two papers: one alone and one with group. Both were easy. Very funny  participate in class and you will get tons of extra credit. Not to much reading compared to other theology classes. lots of quizes. read text book for quizes you'll be fine.
4.5,Hebrew Bible  taking care of my GER.. And she is making it GREAT. Other reviews are old so listen to me. This lady is a real sweetheart  slightly intimidating at first but that vanishes. Quizzes on Fridays are straightforward. Two short  simple papers as well. Has a sense of humor and is a little cutie. I'd take her again.
1.5,This class is unbelievable boring. The quizzes are HARD and she no longer does tests. Quiz consists of 12 questions with 8 options for answers. She expects you to know details about everything you read so unless you are a theo major stay clear! Oh and she grades essays based on how much she likes you (for most of the class that means they failed)
3.5,she is good i actually like her she is not that bad and tells you what exactly is on test
4,i don't know what everyone's talking about- she has you read and expects you to know what you read! def boring material  but she will love you if you raise your hand even once per class. there are some dates to know but she will tell you what to know. super helpful and understanding  id take her again!
4,She is a very sweet lady. We had quizzes every Friday  which she curves. Participation helps because the class itself is very boring. She is NOT strict with dates. There were 2 tests  a midterm and final  we played Jeopardy to prepare and most people got A's. The reading is too much (50 + pages) if you're not a Theology major.
2.5,Second level theology  she made it hell. Impossible memorization of every king and figure in the bible. Lots of timelines...need to know exact dates...unless u r a theo major don't take this class
1,Awful professor who was biased against the guys in the class. Made 7 of the 8 guys redo their papers even though (in my best opinion) we did well. I do not recommend her... EVER.
5,No Comments
1.5,Boring class. Ease up on the grading too. I put 715 B.C. and got points off cause it was 710 B.C.
2,this guy is tough  first of all everything he says seems to be about hungary. prof magyar  nobody cares  teach the course. and theology has no place in philosophy  they are two different animals. dont rec to anyone  avoid if possible/
1,No Comments
1,easy  but then graded really hard on the papers to achieve bell curve
1,Ugh. Just tell me what you are thinking.
1,Hey pal  I have a hint for ya: Don't bring theology into the mix when you are teaching philosophy. Also  the end of the class should be reserved for question time  not personal crisis time. I don't recommend this teacher to anyone.
1,Literally whole class sat there and had no idea what he was talking about. Ask a question? Get a ridiculous wordy answer. My advice to you Prof. Magyar: start using concret examples for your moral philosophy
5,Teddy is my hero! Best prof I've ever had. He always kept my attention with his antics about Mrs. McGillicutty  his little songs  and his famous accents! Unfortunately  Western did not recognized his sheer brilliance in the classroom  and they have NOT renewed his contract. What a loss to our department! We will all miss you very much Teddy!
5,The best prof ever!!
5,No Comments
5,I love you! You are the best teacher I have ever had! Thank you for all your effort and enthusiasm!!!!
5,Awesome! Keeps you awake with his unique sense of humour!...Enjoy...
5,It's like he jumped out of a cartoon. He's great  makes class fun.
5,Like watching a stand-up comedian! He must get really tired after teaching!
5,The best professor you will ever meet. It has been an absolute pleasure.
1.5,This class was suppose to be so easy and it turned out to be a C for me. Thermo with Griggs was easier than this guy. He sucks.
5,Very good teacher. Explained the concepts clearly and helpful with all homeworks. He conducts help sessions at regular intervals. He is very concerned about the students and his performance as a teacher. He is always willing to help.
5,Karthik is the best professor at Tech. There really should be more teachers like Karthik! He gives ample time to complete assignments and tests are open book/notes and for unlimited time! Shame on you if you don't do well in his class.
5,Karthik is awesome. You learn without being tortured. He grades pretty easy and gives you plenty of time for everything.
5,Good teacher. Explains the concepts clearly. He is very helpful with the homeworks. Best class this semester!
5,He
5,Awesome! Easiest A. He actually teaches and makes things clear but he is so helpful too. He will tell you if your HW is right before you turn it in so you can fix any errors. Plus you get five bonus points just for coming to class.
5,Really nice guy and a good teacher. Wish there were few more karthik's in the department.
5,one of the best courses at Tech taught by a very good/efficient teacher. Karthik is a nice person  very approachable and very meticulous in his work. Enriching experience !
5,Very organized lectures. Gives good notes and extremely helpful with homeworks. Overall an excellent teacher!
5,One of the best teachers in the ME department. Would definitely take another class from Mr. Karthik/Would recommend people to enroll in his class.
5,Amazing class and an amazing instructor. I would definitely take classes again and again from Dr.Karthik. A+++++
5,One of the best classes at Tech. Karthik makes it enjoyable  easy and engrossing. I would definitely take classes from him again.
5,Very helpful teacher. Communicates well with students.
5,Great Teacher. Very Helpful towards students.
3,easy  that is all I have to say. he is a really nice guy
5,cool deal mama
5,So far the best class I've taken at tech. Quite professional and he likes his job.
5,A nice instructor. Very easy on grades/Assignments and makes his class interactive and interesting.
5,A brilliant Constitutional scholar that is not afraid to tackle the sensitive constitutional issues that confront our nation. He is very clear about is stance on the issues the Court  but he does not attempt to get you to adopt his views. He teaches the class in a fair  objective  and balanced manner. And he will go out of his way to help students.
3,He rambles endlessly and gives lectures from memory. He isn't well prepared for every class although he obviously knowns what he is talking about it comes across disjointed and is impossible to take notes from. Just drill the book and teach your self. Supplements save lives.
5,Professor Fair is the best teacher that I've ever had. He makes it clear from day 1 that he is available to help his students. If you take the time to really listen to him you will learn a lot. His lectures are well crafted. The average listener will learn constitutional law  but the attentive student will learn so much more. He is GENIUS.
4,No Comments
5,Great professor. He is always on the level with his students and will do almost anything to help them out.
5,Fair is the best professor at this law school. He also truly is interested in students  a rarity at this place (see Singer  Norman  and Brew****er  Bill).
5,No Comments
3,First  Con Law is a terrible subject. That being said  he isn't the greatest prof either. His teaching style leaves a lot to be desired  but he's a real nice guy  he lets you know what he expects  and he's fair just like his name says.
3.5,Great guy
5,"Fair is one of the professors truly interested in the students at the law school (I don't say that to slight other professors). I enjoyed his class and knowing him as a person. I do however refuse to rate his ""hotness."""
4.5,No Comments
5,No Comments
5,Professor Fair is one of the best at the law school. If you want to learn the law  you have got to meet this guy!
4,Funny Guy! love the adidas. great singing voice. Nicely dressed. easy to understand. easy to ask questions. very knowledgeable. makes class interesting
5,Dr. Rawdon is easily one of the best profs at Duquesne. He takes a class that could be very monotonous and makes it fun. He moves very quickly  but he's always willing to slow down and help if you need it. His combination of humor and serious teaching makes the class fly by and before you know it  you understand Calc. Pretty amazing.
2,he is a funny guy  but thats not what the class should be about! he doesnt teach anything...at all. he just copies problems onto the board straight from the book and then tells a story about his son. he isnt very good at answering questions either.
5,He's hysterical. Also he's a very good teacher. He moves at a rather fast pace  you need to do the homework in order to keep up. His tests don't have any suprises on them  he'll always give you the test from the previous year. By far the most entertaining math class I've ever had.
4,If you have taken calc in highschool  the class can still be hard but not unbearable. Do the homework and take your time on the quizes  they can be tricky. His teaching methods are good though  he gives you the fishing pole instead of the fish.
4,He makes class interesting although very challenging. I liked him so much in Calc one I took him in Calc two.
4.5,Great Professor! He is extremely intelligent  personable  and very hot. He keeps class interesting by telling funny stories.
5,Great teach but hard class. He kept the class interesting. However  he did not explain maple and other programs used in the class - making the class harder than it had to be.
5,One of the best math professors...Not only is he really intelligent but also really funny! Let's face it  integration is not most people's definition of a good time - but I absolutely loved the class!
1,Very hard class  not easy!! Expects you to know things that were never taught. Stay away!!
5,You will never encounter another math prof with a better personality. He keeps you from drifting off with his random stories about goulash  etc.
5,Awesome teacher. Very good at breaking the monotony  especially since he teaches math  yet you still learn a ton. Only down side is very long homework assignments  which aren't checked in depth. Tests aren't too bad. Overall  one of Duquesne's finest.
5,had for calc and topics in math  VERY VERY GOOD! would definitely recommend. the COOLEST teacher you will ever have  both in class and out  without a doubt. TAKE HIM!!!
5,Really fun and interesting!
4,Only one of the coolest professors you could ever ask for.
5,My favorite professor at EKU in 3 years. Hard grader but really rewards improvement. Writing assignments are short and easy. He tells really great stories. Take the class for the stories alone.
5,After I read these reviews I didn't want to like this class. But one smile at me the first day and he got me. Yeah  he knows he's a campus Rock Star. But it only adds to his charm. The man just loves his job. Never in a bad mood. Passionate and brilliant. Every class is a show. And you'll learn alot. Sit in front for the best view. :)
5,Class was fun but I didn't go. I didn't read or do anything. I was going to withdraw midterm but he told me if I committed hard to class he would help me with the work and maybe I could pass on a D. Worked my butt off and got a B at the end. Really really good guy because he cares about students and helps so much. Best professor ever.
5,Dr. Rahimzadeh is intimidating at first and yes  he's arrogant. But he has every right to be. He has such a strong grasp of early English literature and his lectures immediately pull you in. Brilliant and passionate and very funny. After a few weeks you realize he's so sweet too. And his clothes are cuter than anybody else's in class. A plus.
5,Totally adorable. He's this weird combination of super shy and super aggressive at the same time. Everything you want from a professor  crazy smart and always entertaining. Listen to lectures carefully because every sentence he says is hilarious. Every single one. And like he says  do the reading  come to class  take notes  go home with the A.
5,if you don't take this professor during your time at EKU  you will never forgive yourself. If every professor were like him  id never want to graduate. He is absolutely incredible. He cares about the students  he is insanely smart and outgoing  and wants to see you succeed. Please  if you get the chance  take class with him. you won't regret it
5,If you have the chance to take him  DO IT! He will make you work for your grade  but if you put in the effort  he is willing to give you as much help as you need. He seriously is amazing!!
5,Dr. Rahimzadeh is an amazing professor. In his class  you feel respected  and you want to be there. He is so funny and smart. He's very approachable and is so willing to help and encourage you. There is a group presentation  but most of your grade on that is for preparation  so just do your work  and you'll be fine. Attendance is mandatory.
5,Dr. Rahimzadeh is brilliant and he knows it. Which can be very annoying. He's been everywhere  he's read everything  and he thinks he's right about everything. But he's also the nicest  most supportive  funniest professor I've had at Eastern. And yes he's nice to look at. If you don't take his class you are missing out on a key EKU experience.
5,Dr. Rahimzadeh is by far my favorite professor. He is so helpful and tries to connect with each student. I have been to his office multiple times and he always encourages me and tells me what to do to get better with my work. He also keeps his lectures interesting and makes the entire class laugh constantly. I would recommend taking him.
5,He's a Silver Fox with a side of Awesome Sauce! He has a gazillion lines of Shakespeare memorized so every class starts with a performance  sometimes with props and costumes. Really cool and really fun. And you'll learn tons. Just don't let him catch you staring at his eyes or his hair or his everything. You'll blush and it will be awkward.
5,This was probably one of the most amazing classes I have ever experienced in college. Dr. Rahimzadeh managed to make the most boring  horrible ancient stories some of the most interesting things to learn about. If you read the text and come to class there is no reason you shouldn't get an A. He's seriously brilliant and he will change your life.
5,There is a lot of work to do in the class  but it made me feel like I had earned my A. I didn't like everything we had read  but his lectures about the texts were so much fun  and his knowledge blew me away. He explains the importance of every text and is just overall a great teacher. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
5,I didn't want to take John Milton but had to have an upper level. Now I'm obsessed with him and the Renaissance era. This was most intense experience I've had at Eastern  and pretty much every one of Dr. Rahimzadeh's lectures blew our minds. He's brilliant and passionate and he is beautiful to look at and listen to. Take anything he teaches.
4.5,He is a great professor. He loves to sit down and meet with you one on one and is willing to help at any time.
4.5,He tells you exactly how to get an A  you have to work for it but if you're willing it's right there. He is always willing to talk to you  make accommodations  and really goes out of his way to help a student who asks for it. He says any version of the text book is fine but MAKE SURE YOU GET THE OLD VERSION.
5,Dr. Rahimzadeh is such a great professor! Lectures are always interesting (but DO NOT MISS THEM  because they're on the test)  and he is hilarious. I didn't think anyone could make early lit fun  but he does. Two 1 PG papers and one 4-5 PG paper  and he's a little picky (but helpful!). If you take good notes and read the stories  you'll do fine. :)
5,Amazing professor! Definitely made my Shakespeare course amazing. He was very clear in lectures and what he expected for exams. He doesn't try to trip you up and has a genuine desire for you to succeed. Tests are not cumulative. Also a funny and engaging speaker  you will hear lots of great stories. Definitely recommend.
5,Brilliant man  absolutely one of the best EKU has to offer. Take a class with him if you can  you won't regret it.
4,Dr. Rahimzadeh is an awesome professor. He's funny  relevant and crystal clear with the material. You WILL leave knowing that you didn't waste your time or money. Do the homework and show up for class. Also  acting projects are BIG in this class. VERY fun! NOTE: If you don't want to act  don't take his class.

5,Excellent professor
4.5,Very good teaching style... funny & unique.
1,"Monica is by far the worst employee at UVic. She is rude  unclear  and makes these labs as hard as she possibly can. I get why  it's to ""weed out"" the weak students who shouldn't be furthering their degree in Chemistry  but she makes it miserable to want to pursue  even if a student is capable enough. I received an A in 101  and am taking 102."
1,The lab portion of Chem 101 is ran by Monica  pray that you do not have her as your TA. She is unkind and very very intimidating  you can not mess up or make a mistake if she is anywhere near by. Chem labs are marked very unfairly  because not all the TA's mark the same. Chem labs are extremely time consuming and misleading. GO TO HELP HOURS!!!
1,The rumors are true - she is a very difficult woman. But if you need chem for your degree  you can't avoid her  she is the senior lab instruction for 1st yr labs (and the 'prof' for 091 - though you have to teach yourself everything  its online). Be prepared  get your work in ON TIME and hope for the best  its not likely she'll have any grace :/
1,Monica in person outside of class she can be nice. In class another story. She is very rude  unreasonable  and she gives you the run around like she can't be bothered. If you have to take chem I suggest you take it at Camosun and transfer the credits. I have had to go over her head many times for my lab to be graded again for a proper mark.
1,I agree that there are too many formal lab papers give this is just the laboratory component of one five courses that any student is dealing with
1,Doesn't give you enough time to do the write-up. I had only two days and I had to contend with a physics write-up as well. The labs take three hours and the lab itself three hours which is a little bit long.
1,I would recommend considering applying to UBC instead of UVic . Their courses are much more balanced than Uvic which is more technical .. like a trades program.
1,THe laboratory part of this course takes too much time in general. At other schools there are less full write ups which allows students to focus more on the lecture course
4,She marks hard but consistent. When I asked for feedback on a grade I found harsh she willingly set up a meeting and explain where I lost points and how I could improve. My lab marks significantly increased following this meeting. I found her very helpful if questions were well thought out and relevant.
1,I spend to much time doing the lab whcih is not co-related to the course and teaches you nothing. Lots and lots of formal write-ups at this school
1,Too many formal papers not a good instituion. If you quailfy to attend UBC make sure you go there
1,Not a good program at all too much busy work
1,I believe that the Chem labs at Uvic are designed too much as busy work and do not encourage the use of one's brain. The labs are laborious but nothing is learned.
2,My first ever TA at university. She really goes hard on you  ESPECIALLY on safety  but it's because this is your first chemistry lab and if you don't get it down now  you'll get hurt later on and she does not want that AT ALL. Nice sometimes... sometimes not  really hit or miss. Switch if you can. Future labs will be better if you continue chem
1,Because of her behaviors  I changed the major. She is very tough grader proferrsor  during my first year in the university I faced lots of probelms and these probelms because of her. I emailed her for asking the questions about lab  she told me that I need to study by myself and she was not a high school teacher. I was so dejected.
1,don't ever expect Monica to cut you any slack. because its guaranteed she wont
1,Very rude. Is not empathetic at all  does she have human emotions? no one knows.
1,Really terrifying. Make sure you study for your lab quizzes and be prepared for her to be really harsh.
1,Labs don't correlate with the lecture material.
1,Sets you up to fail
1,He is awful. His instructions are confusing. He gives very long exam reviews and then not of it is on the actual exam. You get a minute to answer each question on Exams and they are the majority of your grade.
5,Professor Masten had me concerned at the beginning of the semester however  I followed grading guidelines for discussion boards (which are easy) and essays and did well. The tests are a little more difficult because they are closed note/book and you're given a very limited time!
2,Not a very good professor  but not the worst. Like going to Mcdonalds when you want Chick-Fila.
5,Great professor  by far the best one I have had for an online class. About 4 essays throughout the class but makes it clear of what he expects. Gives feedback  even if it is just to say it was a good essay  which I believe means a lot.
5,inspirational  caring
4,I would take him again now that I understand his grading and standards. They aren't made clear in the syllabus so it took a while. Only two quizzes  but they are definitely challenging. Essays are hard to figure out at first  but there are 5-6 (200word)  and a discussion every week. Overall  not a bad class  just depends on your preference.
3,He's a good professor. His lectures aren't to long or boring  he does group and solo activities so you aren't just sitting there listening to him talk. There wasn't a lot of reading from the textbook and he is a nice person. I would recommend his class because it's not boring  he isn't rude  and the material is interesting.
5,Organized lectures  great prof  cares about students  best in A&M Commerce  don't complain  takes time with students
4.5,best prof in this univ
5,I am in psy 2315 now (spring 2016) and he has only five 200-word essays in 15 weeks  plus 14 short opinion questions. It is almost impossible not to get full credit. He does was want references in APA style and does not permit direct quotations. The tests are bit hard.
2.5,This professor gave wayyyy too many assignments. We had several repetitious assignments within the first week. I do not like the way he organizes his work on blackboard. He is just a confusing professor overall. I would not recommend taking him........
3.5,Professor Masten was excellent this semester! He will work with you and has the grades posted quickly!
1.5,William Masten is not a professor I'd ever recommend. He's lectures are very scattered. The only benefit is that all the information you need to pass is in the Power Points and book. Don't expect to gain much from him personally.
2,Masten  while I'm sure he's a great  harilous person outside of class  he's definately not that way in class. He is very unclear of this subject and reads straight from his Pearson PowerPoints. I will not take his class again because I learned absolutely nothing.
1.5,Summer on line class syllabus was long and confusing. His response to email ques.  were even more confusing. Tests were impossible to prepare for and didn't cover material that went with assignments. . A lot of papers up to 6 per week  but easy. Class not paced well. Online set up disorganized! He didn't turn in grades on time to register.
1,Worse professor I ever had. He is not willing to help students out and is random in class. When he attempted to teach he would use youtube videos of others teaching.
2.5,This online course is super easy but you have to do your reading to pass any and all quizzes. There are 4 quizzes  no exams and NO PAPER!! Just read  turn your work in on time and get your A.
2.5,Dr. Masten's online classes are always easy. However  he doesn't grade discussions in a timely manner. Sometimes it can be 4 or 5 weeks before you find out your grade  and by that time you have completed several more discussion posts. Exams are easy and are graded automatically.
5,Dr Masten knows a lot and teaches a great course. Some students he should throw out on their ear. But he puts up with them for some reason.
1.5,He knows psychology but he is VERY scattered and unhelpful. I dont know what happened between the good reviews and now but he does not like us asking questions  he gets off topic ALL the time. Most of us bought the book from the bookstore and they have the 12th edition. He is still on the 11th and doesnt care that the chapters are very different.
1,the assignments were very easy but assigned very randomly. almost no notice for our final essay! just a few days before it was due. it wasn't on the syllabus. a nice person  but very forgetful and vague. student discussion made up 90% of class content. would not take again.
1,Nice lady  not a great prof. She has a lot of interest in the subject  but she doesn't really know what she is doing. Forgets everything (including to show up for class). Tries really hard to make other people agree with her opinions.
5,Adele is the most amazing professor I have ever had! All these ratings stating she's a horrible professor are probably from lazy students who refuse to think out of the box! She is a sociology prof and expects you think sociologically.She has trouble convey her message  but take the time to talk to her one on one and it'll all become clear !
3.5,A brilliant professor. Make sure to show up to class and get yourself recognized. The more active you are in your own education  the more she is willing to help you along. If you put effort into your papers  you will be rewarded for it. highly recommended.
3.5,She is brilliant and fantastic! Sh has a hard time conveying her intelligence  but she is simply marvelous.
1,Absolutely the worst professor I've ever had. Never knew what was expected of us in the class because she didn't know what was going on herself. Spent whole semesters begging her to tell us what the assignments were so we'd have a mark for the term. Then  when she did assign something  she'd forget she assigned it. Most disorganized person ever.
3.5,Adele is a really great prof  who really cares about what she is teaching and her students.You really have to show up to class  and do all the course material  but the class itself is quite easy.
4.5,As long as you do the readings. It's simple. Do the work and you can pass no prob.
4,I LOVE this woman. Yep  she's scatteredbrain but oh well. She's amazing and really cares about the subject. Get to know her outside of the classroom and you won't regret it. She is one of my fave profs and I'll be taking more courses with her next semester.
1,No Comments
4.5,Adele ROCKS! It's not surprising that most intro students don't like her - she doesn't use powerpoint and makes you think out of the box. She can be scatterbrained  but she knows what she's talking about and she loves what she does. If you put effort in  you will be rewarded.
1,I do not recommend this professor to any students wishing interested in sociology  turned me off completly to the subject. too many classes were spent watching pointless videos..writing endless reading notes that were worth very little..if attendance weren't taken  i prob never would have gone to class..nice person though  not so great prof:(
2,If you are a shy person....do not take the class...sociology of gender is a class where she wants you to participate..basically she just picks people randomly and gets them to give out answers and opinions...interesting class but not for shy students
1,Horrible Prof. Never knows what she will do each day. Very unorganized. Never hasmarks back until months later. Learned nothing from her...
1,Horrible Prof. Never knows what she will do each day. Very unorganized. Never hasmarks back until months later. Learned nothing from her...
1,Mueller is a very oblivious professor. She sometimes just goes on random rants that make no sense what so ever and have relation to the topic at hand. During the start of the year I was looking forward to Sociology but now this field is ruined for me because of the experience in her class.
4,I love adele! she is great  i have had her for both research methods and senior seminar. I was iffy at first she does tend to be back and forth about due dates and requirements  but she is an easy marker. Always willing to sit down and have a chat  very caring individual :)
4,I love Adele. I have had alot of boring profs that just stand in front and say EXACTLY what was in the book... like i cant read. She talks about stuff that isnt on the test... there arent any tests. If you did the readings  you can get an A on every single paper. I have 12 credits with her... all A's. Shes very easy to talk to also!!!
1,Adele is not clear AT ALL...she's all over the place. You have no idea whether you will get an A or a D on a paper...that is if she doesnt loose it first. Not recommended....Classes we're useless  talking about the same points over and over again.
2.5,Okay. Im not going to be mean ill be fair. She is scatterbrained but  all sociology profs are. Hense  the discipline must have an effect on the mind. She is a little crazy but a great woman. She shouldnt be condemned for personality. I did not even know what was going on in her class but  if i talked to her one on one she was fine.
5,She was sooooo great.... Makes sure you understand  works with you until you get it.
5,Mrs. Talbert is Awesome! She makes sure you understand the each math concept before moving on  takes time with each student to help them.I feel well prepared for intermediate Algebra
5,Mrs. Talbert and Mrs. French teach math at Northeast  and I REALLY recommend you take their class!!! They are extremely helpful  work is easy  they are always friendly  they offer online classes which are so awesome  and most of all they truly care how you do. In the 3 tests we've had  I've made  99%  99%  and 101%. THEY ROCK! Math is so easy now!
4.5,I feel well prepared for intermediate. She is very helpful and takes the time to explain things if you don't get it the first time. She is very patient. I was Math challanged before this class and now I feel like I have a good base to move on.
5,basic math/beginner algebra. very energetic instructor. answers questions thoroughly. makes math fun and enjoyable. i highly recomend her.
5,Not necessarily a easy class  but well worth your effort and time! This instructor is awesome! She builds your knowledge up from ground Zero to algebra. She is very thorough  takes the extra time to work with students 1on 1  not something you see every
5,very good teacher for beginning algebra. very helpful and encourageing. i was well prepared for intermediate level.
5,awesome teacher  I recomend her to anyone  she is GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!
5,awesome teacher  and she goes out of her way to help you out if you have a problem.
5,Amazing teacher. Ms Phillips has GREAT lectures. Don't miss them. She gives practice tests. Do them! The semester project was time consuming  but you learn a lot. Labs are fun  laid back  and fairly easy. Lab reports - follow rubric and you do fine. One of the BEST teachers at TCC. Five stars!
5,"I LOVED Prof P. Her assignments were not difficult - film summary  labs were fun. Tests are open book for the most part. If you run into any ""life issues"" as she calls them  email her. She REALLY cares about you. Definitely best instructor I've had online. Responds to emails. Did you know you can't feed your cat milk? Would take again  if I could."
5,Prof Phillips is a great teacher. Definitely one of my favorites at TCC. She really cares. I learned a lot. But  I had to work hard! Tests are fair  usually there is a practice test. Start your semester project early! I loved this class and wish she taught other classes.
5,My favorite class so far at TCC. Very fair and understanding. Ask for an extension if you need one. Professor Phillips LOVES biology. You will  too! Study  take notes  do your extra credit.
4,Professor Phillips loves her job  and has so much to teach. Sit close listen  be on time. Its a lot of work but also a lot to learn. She is such a caring teacher and wants you to pass. You won't find many professors like her so don't miss this.
4,Great teacher. If you are a hard worker you will pass.
5,Mrs. Phillips is a very caring teacher. She will work with your schedule. Just ask. She loves biology and expects a lot. But  I appreciate that as a major. Keep up... take good notes. She is very fair. I loved the class and Mrs. Phillips.
5,Mary Wells Phillips  BIO for Majors. She is a great professor. She can be a bit confusing but SHE CARES. Shes super sweet  and cares for her students education. You WILL have to do a semester project that deals with research or volunteering work and a presentation for all of it. You can either choose a research project or to volunteer.
5,Prof Phillips's class was pretty enjoyable to take. I had been dreading taking bio but she has made it an easy experience. I was in a blended class that met once a week for lab. So for our class she was a little easier with the deadlines  but she's really understanding. If you're not interested in doing a semester project  don't take the class.
5,Professor Phillips does everything she can to make learning fun and easy to understand. She helps you be the best you can be in her class and she is full of amazing stories and information about biology!
5,"I enjoyed the class A LOT. The first couple of labs were a little confusing but after that the remaining labs were great. Professor Phillips was always well organized and always wanted her students to succeed. Even though I have not been big into science or biology  this class taught me a lot. Very nice and helpful when ""life happens."""
5,Prof. Phillips was an amazing teacher! If you put fourth an effort  you will pass. Very responsive on emails. Very good lectures. A wonderful Professor and person.
5,Great instructor and person. Very organized. Gives great feedback. Practice exams! YEAH!!!! Makes you ask questions. Wish she taught other courses. Absolutely recommend Ms. Phillips. LOVED her and her class!!
4,Prof. Phillips was one of my favorite professors I've had so far! I took her blended Biology class  so I only saw her for a Lab once a week. The weekly workload was very clearly lined out and I knew what was due and when. She was pretty lenient on due dates if you asked her  and was always willing to help. I would highly recommend!
4,Prof. Phillips was awesome! She is an extremely kind woman who will help you out if you ask. She's also very flexible with due dates. I learned a lot but there were times when I was just confused on what to expect/do. Tests and assignments weren't too bad. There is one big semester project that took up a lot of time. Take Prof. Phillips. Loved her!
5,Theres not really much to say about her besides she is an amazing teacher. She loves what she does and when she starts to get in to it you can see her eyes light up. She is incredibly sweet  and will help you if you fall behind. Tests and quizzes are open book  and the semester project is BIG! but worth it in the end.
4,Professor Phillips is a very good professor. She really cares about her students and wants to seeyou succeed. Her lectures can be confusing sometimes because she goes off on tangents. She responds to emails in a timely manner and is always willing to help out after class if you have questions. Just remember to go to class or you will get lost.
5,Mrs. Phillips was not the best at getting back to you on time via email  but if you stayed after class to talk  she is more than willing to hear you out and fix any problems your having.
5,I really loved Professor Phillips. I genuinely enjoyed attending her class each week. There were sometimes when the assignments were a bit confusing  but she was extremely lenient with due dates when she knew that we were confused. She always e-mailed back very fast and was always very willing to meet up whenever needed. She is also super nice!
5,Professor Phillips is TERRIFIC! She loves biology and cares about her students. She is knowledgeable and will try to explain things so that you can understand. Everything is posted on Bb  so if you miss a lecture  you won't get too lost. I enjoyed the labs and videos. I highly recommend!
5,Best Prof Ive ever had.
5,Hard course  but an excellent professor who clearly knows what he is doing. It is a challenging course  but if you put in the work then you will do fine.
5,I loved this class. Mr. Dinneen knows his stuff  and presents it in a way that actually makes it interesting. His tests are not easy  but he gives several opportunities for extra credit towards the end of the semester. I really feel like I learned and retained a lot of information in this class. Show up  take good notes  and you'll be fine.
4.5,I took his 16 week online course  and for anyone who is considering taking it be ready to read  answer questions in clear detail  and sit down and really work on the course for at least 2-3 hours at a time. If you really put in the effort  you'll easily pass. Plus  he's a great professor and pretty funny  too!
5,I took this 4wk class online. There is a lot of reading from the textbook and PowerPoint lectures. Tests are in the form of 2 essays and you have to know your stuff to get a good grade. He gives detailed feedback which is helpful. And offers weekly extra credit. This class is not an easy A but he is a good professor and I learned a ton!
4,"For the first test I was furious  I studied hard  read all assignments got barely C. I found what he is looking for  I got A. Pay attention what he said "" this will be in test"" or "" on the test I want you to draw the diagram"". He said those when students having hot debate. I did all the extra credits (3).Ask questions  be prepared  be creative."
5,I wondered why he didn't have a perfect score. Now that I see the rating criteria  he's not an easy A  and I don't think he'd want to be. The work is fair. It's college. He does a great job explaining things  he answers every question and he grades fair. I wish I had him for every course.
5,Mike is very passionate about teaching Government! He is tough but if you attend every class and keep up with the readings you will pass his class
4.5,He is AWESOME!! At first I wasn't sure but it got better. When he assigns a reading  read it! He will quiz you! Lectures are long  he sometimes goes over time but only by a few minutes. He is funny  cracks silly jokes. Study for his exams  they are not easy. They are 2 questions and written. You must work for grade. Would absolutely take him again!
5,Mr. Dineen is a excellent teacher. He's very professional.His class used alots of powerpoint which he is very good explaining everything in details. He's very good at teaching but I think that his test is hard but he make sure you truly learn and deserve the education that you need from his class. He's a very nice professor
4.5,I took his inline class. Really fun guy and very helpful. Made the class challenging and interesting. I have learn a lot. I highly recommend him. You will have to work a lot.
5,Great teacher! Very funny and will answer any question you have without hesitation. Highly Recommended! A++
5,There are 4 tests - 100% free response to a rather vague set of questions. It's almost all lecture  so you must attend class if you want an A. Outlines  lectures  and many aids are on Blackboard. This is not a blow off class  you must work hard if you want an A. Good instructor though  very clear on what he wants  and offers EC at end of semester.
5,Mr. Dineen is an absolutely wonderful instructor. He really knows his stuff. Attendance is a must. Tests are difficult  but if you study you will do good. Your grade will reflect the effort you put into learning the material. He makes learning about politics fun and didn't try to sway us left or right. He made us make up our own minds.
5,This was one of the best courses I've ever taken. He puts so much effort into his lectures and assignments  you really learn everything inside and out. You must put in the effort and follow his requirements in the syllabus to do well. Waiting until the last day to do the assignments is not a good idea. Not an easy A  but highly recommend.
5,He is an absolute amazing teacher  you MUST attend the class he is way better in class than online. he truly has a passion for this course. but KNOW YOUR STUFF! he has 4 tests with 2 essays  if you do not know the information or slept through lecture you will fail the tests  Read the textbook. I would recommend him any day! He is hilarious too.
5,The class feels like an honor's level class at times  due to his demanding nature. However  you earn every point you get  and you get every point you earn. Attendance is Mandatory. 4 tests  composed of two essays apiece. Gives possible topics for next test well in advance. Must be able to think for yourself and be prepared for class. Tough but fair
5,Mr. Dinneen is very intimidating at first. I thought it would be a ton of work  turns out he was great. Best Teacher I have ever had. Smart  Passionate  and even funny. MUST GO TO CLASS
5,His class is how any college course should be. He is very passionate about his subject and demonstrates so much knowledge. The point of the class is to understand our government and as long as you show up  review your notes  and prepare for class  you will succeed in that and it will be interesting. Don't expect an easy class
5,Great teacher!
4,Nice guy  if you have questions just ask. He is someone you really want to put in your network...for the future. So behave in class.
3,The most boring class ever. He goes too fast when lecturing and he grades harshly. He did curve our tests however which helped. Study a lot and try to keep up on reading. Pretty nice to me  just be nice back and try.
4,A nice little guy. He wrote the book  so he knows what he's talking about. But he WILL put you to sleep. You have no choice though  because he's the only one who teaches this class. It's not bad though. Just make sure you take notes from his power points  and read when he specifically tells you to.
4.5,Really nice guy  but the material is boring. His tests are hard  definitely study more than you normally would. He likes detail. Very helpful teacher  though a little forgetful at times. His bowties are cute.
2,these classes made me want to jump off a bridge. I cannot stand his cocky conservative views on anything. the only thing i liked was the project for survery and its relevence to the real world. It actually was an important part of my resume.
5,Great teacher!
1,this prof. really needs to retire.he is just an miserable old man  who thinks he is better than you and doesnt need to help you bc you should already know.he is very short with you and mean. also is very unclear about every element of the project and then messus up your grades on reports/tests.
3,Not a good grader. Makes a lot of mistakes in grading. Powerpoints are boring. Tests are tough  you must study power points. Other than that it's not a bad class. Just keep on top of how he's grading you.
2,BORING and a very difficult grader and loses students work!!! Not a very helpful teacher and I would not recommend ANYONE to take him!!
3,He's okay...a little nitpicky with the papers. Nice guy  but I dread taking him again b/c I know there'll be several papers involved. But he did take us on a day trip to NY
1,class sucks
3,Kinda boring with all his powerpoints. He does know his stuff very well. His test are kinda hard and the project is just annoying.
2.5,Try to buddy up to someone who has taken the class and get them to give you their old project as a reference. He is often unclear about what he expects and sometimes thinks you know things that you don't. He is a stickler on grading  but ok in general.
3.5,He's ok - projects thats all only 3 tests
1,"James 3:1 ""Not many of you should become teachers"" - Jesus No just no. Listening will get you more confused. Day 1 we were already behind an entire lecture. Enough said."
1,Hes not that great of a teacher. He talks about a lot of irrelevant things. You learn more about him than you do about the actual subject. He does curve  but you don't learn. WHICH SUCKS! Hes nice  but his class and ethic are annoying. He doesn't teach well. His test and lecture doesn't correlate! JUST study and stick thru the class
2.5,Grades easy and is very nice to all students. He gets kinda lost in his own lectures sometimes but put up with him and study along side his notes and you should get at least a B+.
2.5,Great guy  really cares about his students. Stick to the Biochem notes and you'll do fine. He curves so most people can pass with a C  but if you cant get at least a B- in his classes  you need to become a Business major. Attend lecture because he often cuts lots of material to study.
3,Very good looking. Overall  a very very very very EASY grader. Curves like crazy. EASY C in his class. Average is a B+. Nothing to worry about. Went to office hours and blew me off though.
4.5,Professor Cody is proficient at what he does and his method of teaching is excellent. He uses powerpoints and practice questions. He ensures that the class has complete understanding of each topic before proceeding to the next. He gives assignment for each chapter in an effort to make us practice and review the material on our personal time.
1.5,"I'm 50/50 on Cody. On the one hand  I got an A  but I feel like I taught myself a lot of the material from the book. Lots of homework! He's very thorough and knows his stuff  but he assumes his students are brain dead no-nothings and can actually be quite condescending and discouraging (""I don't know how you guys are going to do on this test"")."
5,This teacher was excellent. He knows his stuff but dont take advantage. I had him a while back  you will learn a lot. Besides he's Italian how could he go wrong!
2,has little respect for students  he speaks down to all of us. Some of us are his same age! He also refuses to go over the material in a step-by-step manner  he assumes we all know what he is doing.
1.5,"Horrible. My entire class is lost. He doesn't go over HW and only has 2 responses to questions  ""Google  People!"" or ""This is an upper level class  I expect you to know that."" He has a major ego issue  seems to me like he got beat up a lot when he was younger. His entire class is reading slide (provided by the publisher). Drop  Drop now!"
4,Hard but very fair. Highly recommend.
5,AWESOME. I loved having him as a professor. He's really good at getting the point across. Helpful when you don't understand. Very organized and nice.
4,Very well organized  exams were fair but you must do your homeworks and study on your own to do well.
5,This was a challenging class. I took it on Saturday and Sunday from 9-12. He was the lecture professor and I liked him a lot. He was so nice and so clear about what was on his exams. There are no surprises.
5,HE WAS MY REMEDIAL MATH TEACHER WAYYY BACK. GREAT GUY  EASY AS HELL  AND THEN AGAIN SO WAS THE CLASS. TOTAL PUSH OVER  CARING  AND NICE. TRIES TO BE ENTERTAINING. I LIKE HIM A LOT
4,"Prof Cody comes off a lot more difficult than his class really is...in a class that was mandatory for me  I dreaded it...the typical ""if you are not dedicated  there's the door"". Well  I got the b+  earned the respect of a difficult teacher  and learned things aren't always what they seem at first."

1,Runs the Chem Department like an even shorter Napoleon. The whole C Building is toxic  and he's been inhaling the fumes.
1,This guys a horror. All he does is read his slides  he never answers a question. He's just plain mean.
5,Excellent Professor. Helpful. Funny. And Genuine.
5,She made me want to be an English major. Her teaching style and ability is superb. I had so much fun with the material  and she grades fairly. She gives so much help as long as you ask.
4.5,first day of class i was intimidated cuz she lets you know right away its going to be A LOT expected from you ie READ/STUDY. GRADES HARD ON ESSAYS. i got 2 B's and i usually get A's. EXPLAIN EXPLAIN EXPLAIN YOUR THOUGHTS ON PASSAGES ON PAPERS! overall i learned A LOT take her if u r an english maj
5,Great teacher. She grades hard on papers  but is easier on exams. She has a passion for literature  and one can tell she loves her job.
5,very nice. brilliant  yet easy to understand. professional and funny. will help you if you ask. Encourages class discussions. 2 papers  midterm  and final.
4,A ball full of energy this one is  she will keep you laughing and interestred in lectures. Sometimes I found the paper topics a little difficult  but they were managable. Overall  good experience.
5,I really liked her. I had her twice  and she made me think. She does play favorites however  but if you participate she will like you. She is more about the thought behind things than the technicality of the work you do.
5,I really enjoyed this class and this professor. I thought it was refreshing to read works by female authors especially since male authors tend to be emphasized in english classes.
4,Alot of reading and interpreting/analying novels on your own.
3,She is really nice and passionate about the material but she is so boring! I could barely sit through her lectures! They way she grades papers is very misleading and inconsistent. On one I spent hours making sure it was perfect and I only got a B  on another I wrote it in 3 hours and got an A. Go figure.
3.5,Excellent class and excellent professor. Some of the material covered is very tough  but Dr. Bonca explained it well. I will never love The Romantics  but she made them understandable. Great passion for her subject. Student-friendly.
2.5,Much emphasis on unknown female only authors? glanced over and skipped prominent male authors to spend time solely on female issues. Hard grader  hard tests. Journals she doesn't collect. Everyday let the class go early  I felt robbed  unprepared. Verbose  but lacking in the clasics of the period. Need some new perspective  a universal PC view.
5,Dr. Bonca is passionate about literature! Take her class & you'll walk away w/ an immense appreciation for the same. Journals were helpful & I definitely used them for writing essays & exam prep. She reads everything you give her & makes herself available to students. She's an amazing person.
1.5,Does not adjust grading for in-class essays. Grades as if they are done out of class. Nitpicks explications. Journals were pointless because only received feedback on a few. Majority of journals are collected on the last day of class. Grading them beforehand would have been helpful.
5,Dr. Bonca is an amazing professor. Her love for the literature really shows. Yes  she's tough on papers but that just means you need to put in extra effort...not every class is going to be an easy A. Definitely worth taking  even if you are not interested in the time period  she makes it worth it!
5,Helpful  clear  knowledgeable  pleasant  I like her a lot  I believe most will agree she's a great professor. Very accomodating & passionate about English! Take her.
4.5,Took her my freshman year for English 101. Was always helpful to look over my paper and to answer my questions. I want to take her for more English classes  but she usually teaches at El Toro.
3.5,No Comments
5,I really enjoy the amount of attention he puts into trying to understand where his students are coming from. He is obviously passionate about his subject and has great practical knowledge which brings the philosophical concepts we study down to a workable level for Undergrads.
4.5,If you can follow his classes you will remember them forever.Yes  he does diverge  but most of the important features of the discussion come through understanding these. One sided? His view IS the other side and he DOES explain both  not liberal  just practical.He does not force feed you things and his views of the school ARE OBVIOUS OBERVATIONS
4.5,very interesting  very energetic.
5,McSteamy
4.5,Dr. C is a great guy. He is totally approachable and helpful. And you can easily bullsh*t your way through his classes!
2,I was very turned off by this individual. Too bad he's very very opinionated and can't take a question for a question and not an attack on his views. I'm dedicated to trying to make it through my college career without having him as a teacher.
5,Ah  the zoo trip  need I say more?
5,Dr. C. seems to really love his teaching...took us to the zoo and showed us cool stuff with the bonobos..he was communicating with them! also showed us films and was generally easy to talk with out of class. I definitely would take a class with him again. The final exam was my favorite.
5,Loved it
5,Good
1,I was really looking forward to my first psych class and he completely turned me off. It was a horrible experience. He definitely played favorites. He constantly complained about the core and was probably just upset that psychology isn't part of it.
2,Rants about the state of and dislike for the school frequently  which is a bummer. Often vague or one-sided in class lecture
5,very enthusiastic
5,perfect
4.5,i like the class so far. Sherry  you are the best  thanks for all the help.
4,She did a nice job of showing us the sea. It was fun.
4.5,I really like this class. She kicked out some cheaters so that means she cares.
4.5,Sherry  you are nice and know a lot about ocean life. I liked it.
5,I really learned a lot in her class
3,Sanchez is a total freak. Talking about sex with college students  makes her day. If you are a christian or have any set of morals beware! She is the most extreme liberal professor I've ever had! I respect the fact that she has an opinion on issues like abortion  but she WILL try to force her extreme liberal views down your neck!
2.5,I'm currently in this class and it sucks. Its friggin health class so it should be easy  and I shouldn't have to try gah dammit!anyway... I studied for the last test and didn't do so well  even with a study guide. It'd be more helpful to know exactly what's on the test. Wellness project is easy tho.
2,OK so this is Health not SEX class......she is a **** and needs to learn that there are other classes! She has no compassion whatsoever and needs to realize that things come up and she does NOT have any understanding parts anywhere...I WISH SHE WOULD GET FIRED OR SOMETHING
5,Loved Her!!! She made sure all her students were up to date on assignments and her tests were fairly easy. Pay attention in class and you will do well!
3,Talks about her sexual actions and sex WAY too much.
5,Her passion is teaching Women's health and human sexuality  but if you take her for statistics she still teaches well  most of the assignments are easy and quizzes and take home tests are easy too.
5,Have to study for the tests  but the class is very easy. She tells you exactly what you need to know for the test and even gives a study guide.
5,Dr. Sanchez is awesome!!! She is very clear on what needs to be done in class and in HEA 375 there are no tests  just weekly quizzes!
5,Great professor.. Have to study for the tests but she makes the class interesting.

1,Very confusing. Makes the simplest problems so confusing. I've never been taught math in the way that he teaches it. I'm better off teaching myself. Do yourself a favor and don't take him unless your good at math.
1,I don't know how anyone could say he is good. He started with Chapter 9 of the book which is crazy. His test are ridiculously hard even with open book and the study sheet. I had to withdraw from the class and get a W because if not I would've ended with a D. No way!I got an A in statistics but I'm failing beginner math... SILLY!
2,Hard to understand with his accent. Lectures were tough I passed with a B+ even with his review sheets. Really nice guy though! Just not recommended unless you know Math.
2.5,I took his Mathematics for Liberal Arts class  and it was ridiculously easy. Attendance isn't mandatory. There are 3 open book exams. He gives a review sheet before each exam that is basically the actual exam with the numbers changed. He can be pretty unclear at times  but if you ask him to explain himself he will.
2,His lectures make no sense but you never have to show up to class. He only gives a midterm and final and as long as you get the review he gives out the class before youll do fine. He uses the same exact questions on the midterm and final as the review with different numbers. he leaves the room during the test and the class takes the test together
4,Has an accent  but doesn't make it any harder to understand. Open book test. Don't play around because of it though. Open book Math is not easy.
3.5,Very thick Russian accent  sometimes hard to understand. Overall a great professor. Explains in detail and will gladly re-explain anything you're not sure on. Attendance is not mandatory  nor is doing homework. 3 tests make up your grade and they are all open book  open notes plus he usually gives a take-home test after to help boost your grade.
2.5,I don't know how people can say hes good. his tests are the review changed. but its still not understandable at all. nothing but tests count towards ur grade  had no idea what i was doing in his class. really brought down my gpa
4.5,Tulovsky is the best teacher at St. Johns. Teaches really well. Easy A... Take him if you can
4,I LOVE THIS TEACHER. seriously i hate math and cannot understand his silly accent but the tests are a breeze  show up the day before for the review and you will get an A no questions.
4.5,thick accent but easy. Open Note Open Book take home tests can't be much easier to get an A then that. in other words he is the man!!!
5,Very easy A.. open book tests... just do the homework and ask him to review it in class... if you don't know anything let him know.... open book tests include your notes and textbook which is great!... great professor ... :)
5,No Comments
3.5,BEST professor.. 3 open book/open note tests.. lets u cheat.. doesnt take attendance after about first 2 weeks of class.. does a review before every test.. easy A [especially if u have smart friends =)]
4,Tulovsky is the man!!!!
1,No Comments
4,Heavy russian accent. very helpful. Open book  open note tests. Sometimes even able to cheat if you wanted. He knows his stuff  tests are a bit hard though.
5,great teacher
5,THE BEST CLASS EVER. U DONT HAVE TO GO  HIS TEST ARE OPEN BOOK  AND U CAN CHEAT. CLASS IS A JOKE EASY A
4,Good math teacher
4,Sound informative and very interesting. Does bring family home life into class but always puts them in context of lessons being taught. Love her.
2,she sucks
5,I loved taking her class!! Although she likes to talk about her kids  she deserves it sounds like theyve been through it. but she is a really good teacher and if you need help  she will give it if you ask. She also has a good sense of humor. She's the best!!
5,online course had lots of quizes. had to read the book  but teacher was helpful
1,She lost my take home final had to retake it with out notes or a book my grade went from A to a B
1,Where do I start...Camarata is unorganized  scatter-brained  and not intouch with reality. She spends if not all  the majority of class time talking about the problems she has with her children. AVOID her classes at all costs!! I didn't learn ANYTHING from 3 semesters worth of classes.

5,Prof Colasurdo is an awesome professor. I just loved his class. He is a great teacher and he is definitely not boring  has a great sense of humor.
3.5,Got an A in his Sociology 1 Winter 2005 class. He has a very abrasive personality  he'll get in your face and ask you rude questions. Sometimes his remarks are stereotypes which will offend you. Overall  his tests aren't too bad  make sure you read the book and review it. He does give pretests/take home tests  use these to your advantage.
4.5,Professor Colasurdo is a great professor. He welcomes discussions and is knowledgeable about the subject. Even though I think Sociology is BS he made it tolerable for me. He's real easy to get along with. Easy A.
5,Awesome guy  can be funny at times. has great discussion in class. lots of written work but fun class to be in
5,"I liked him. 1st day of class he said ""no one's leaving here with less than a C [unless u do absolutely nothing]"" but i took him 2 years ago hope hes still the same. But he's really cool! I recommend anyone to take his class"
5,Mr.C is great. He dose make up his own words but it's kinda funny. He'll talk up until the very last second of the class so don't expect to go home early  ever. Lost of written assignments but they're easy. And easy A. oh yeah  turn your cell phone off in class or he'll get mad
3.5,psy majors beware  this teacher thinks psychology is a waste of time. he's narrow minded  but you shouldn't be afraid to get into debates w/him. i still enjoyed the class because it's an interesting topic  and he is a likeable guy  and he kind of grows on you. it was a fairly easy A.
1,Who hired this guy?! Worst class I have EVER taken.Long tests dry  illogical lectures he makes up words very hard 2 follow.He also changes what he says as if that's what he said all along-including when assignments r due.Wants u 2 memorize not learn.Got an A but it was TORTURE!
4.5,Funny at times  tries to make the fun interesting. He make become repetitive  but he does have good lectures sometimes. Has 3 tests 100 questions and a final. Gives you the pre test for each one of those tests. He might change about 10 or 15 answers from pre test. Ready the book!!!Good Guy.
2.5,His test is hard. The pre-test is not helpful a lot! There are 95 multi-choices questions  which drive me crazy!
5,great teacher do all ur work study and get an A
4,He is enthusiastic and loud. He doesnt like late people and you better have your book with you at every class. Too much work in the class for a GE credit. Too many written essay assignments and quizes. The tests are the same as the pre-tests  and then change later.
4.5,hes cooler than a fan...a little strange but thats what makes the class fun...gotta keep up on your work or it'll screw you later...lots of essays but he gives you a long time to finish...1 take home test to help you out...because of his style of teaching the whole class ends up pretty close...hes o
4.5,Great teacher. Pretty easy class. Do the homework and study the pretest and you'll do fine. He has a good sence of humor.
4,his lectures are boring  i got an A in class  never opened my book. He gives you a pretest with answers  pretest has exactly the same questions as the test. easy easy easy teacher!!!!
5,I liked him  but closed minded at times. He came from left field at times and condescending. Take him.easy essays  follows book...and will not let you sleep in class..
2.5,boringggggg teacherrrrrrrr.........grades easyyyyyyyy.......3 exams and da final =)
3,Very enthusiastic about what he's teaching  but sadly closeminded  although tolerant of dissent. Teaches pretty much to the book.r Very generous grading policy.
5,GREAT GUY BUY TOO ENERGENIC
5,makes learning extremly fun. sometimes give to many essays  buy you'll forgive him. It's hard to get a word in sometimes. Time really flies in this class. For once learning was enjoyable.
5,He is an amazing professor  his tests aren't hard AT ALL  he does have web assignments due every week  but they're easy. He is hilarious  he makes jokes all the time  but I genuinely laugh. Awesome class  very interesting material. I would recommend him 1000 times.
5,Amazing teacher! Easy class  does attendance every class  and doesn't believe in teaching on Fridays. There are two paragraph papers due every Wednesday over interesting topics. You are free to have opinions  he doesn't judge. Really funny and will help you if needed. Even though you have a textbook  you only need it for study guides.
4,Dr. Holcomb is one of the greatest educators I have had since coming to EKU. I had no idea that Health education could be so interesting. Dr. Holcomb is so inspiring as he lectures and the material is easy. Lots o f class discussions  which helps you learn a lot about other cultures. An easy A  students gets all info needed to pass this class.
5,He straight gives you the answers to the test  so if you listen you'll get a 100. You have easy papers every week. Easy A and he does not have class on fridays even though it is MWF
3.5,THIS CLASS WAS BY THE FAR THE EASIEST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN AT EKU. DR. HOLCOMB IS VERY NICE  A LITTLE WEIRD BUT YOU WILL LEARN TO LOVE HIM AND MAKE SURE YOU GO TO EVERY CLASS (NO CLASS ON FRIDAYS) AND DO YOUR WEB ASSIGNMENTS AND COMPLETE YOUR WELLNESS PROJECT AND THERES NO WAY YOU CAN GET ANYTHING LESS THAN A B!!!!
4,His class was cake. We were scheduled to meet MWF but we only ever met on MW. His class is easy and you don't really have to do anything to do well other than your wellness project which still isn't that hard.
4.5,Everyday is a class discussion & it's SUPER easy. You couldn't have an easier class. He takes attendance everyday  but only has class on Mon & Wed for the MWF class. You turn in a two paragraph research paper instead of coming on Friday & it's so simple. He reads off the answers for his tests  so write down what he says. Easy A.
3.5,SO EASY!! Highly recommend. MWF class but he does not have class Fridays - instead you have to write two paragraphs on a given topic and that's. He's super nice and there's virtually no work involved with the class and he tells you word for word what will be on the test. EASIEST CLASS EVER.
5,He is 7 feet of pure awesomeness. Definitely recommended & you will never stress about this class! He relates to the kids. No class on fridays  no final and he only takes off one point if you don't show up for class. But you do learn a lot if you do.
4,He is easy He is real laid back.A study guide for the exams is included in the syllabus.Right before the exams he will walk you through every question and he tells the answer to each one. You must right a little 2 paragraph paper on a current topic that he includes in the syllabus.In return for this he cancels class for a day. He is EXTERMELY EASY!
4.5,I love this professor! He is so funny and no class on friday! I would recommend this class to anyone!
5,Great Professor. Great class. I would deffinetly take another class with this professor.
3,EASY class. I'd reccomend it though no class on friday. Definitely good to not have to walk to begley three days a week. He is really easy going  super easy class. He takes two classes before each test to review EVERYTHING that is gonna be on the test  I cannot stress how easy this class is  I'd recommend him  you will learn a little bit
4,does NOT lecture topics covered in tests. pointless to come to class everyday  no classes on Friday (2 paragraph research paper instead). he covers the entire test a few days before class  discussing and answering all the questions. You can pass with a B if you just show up  take notes. if you miss class only 1 point per class missed.
2.5,Definitely a freshman level class.... Talks about beginner level discussions... Boring.
4.5,He is a great professor. No class on Friday and hardly any work. The work is easy and so are the exams. I highly recommend taking a class taught by Dr. Holcomb.
4,Super easy. He does take attendance but told me that he only counts off one point every day you don't come. And You do have to write the little half page papers every week  but he also only counts off one point for not doing those too. (I think I only did two  and went to class about 50% of the time  had a B.)
5,Entertaining professor. Class is mandatory but it's not at all boring or difficult to sit through. One major health assignment  two tests and one take home final. Very easy  pretty fun and a kind and understanding professor. No class on Fridays either. You write two paragraphs a week on a health topic instead.
5,Love this class. We never had Friday classes  instead you have to write a little one page paper every week on a different curent topic. Very easy A if you do the papers. We only had two test  which had study guides and they were all multipule choice. He is a funny guy who understand that this is a Gen Ed class and is willing to work with students t
5,Super easy. Really funny guy. Doesn't have class on fridays.
4,Dr. Ballard is a very interesting person
1,Unrealistic!! Avoid him!! He is so struck on himself that he does not lecture on important material. He likes hearing himself talk. He is interesting but a joke too.
5,GREAT PROFESSOR! Prepared  prompt  interesting  and fair. He is to the point and business like but is very open to students and helping solve problems.He does answer emails but very quick and direct. I would recommend to anyone. He tries hard to make material relevant and include all of class in discussion.
4.5,He is a great teacher! His teaching methods are awesome and he will help you out a lot if you are interested in a health major! I would definitely recommend him :)
4,I really liked him  his tests were long but not difficult  he is open to listen to your opinion during discussions  and the project is pretty easy. I recomend him.
4.5,I enjoyed his class. Yes  his tests were slightly difficult  but if you study the material you'll be ok. He graded the wellness projects pretty easy  too. He really knows what he's talking about  I would recommend him to anyone!!
5,No he doesn't responed to emails but he is a pretty cool guy and a good teacher
5,Ballard is the man  he only gives you one homework assignment for the entire semester. Though the tests are 70 questions long  they're often over many chapters at a time  meaning if you just read the chapters you'll have no problem. Plus he's funny.
2,His tests are way too complicated and he doesn't respond to e-mail messages.
1,he doesnt explain anything...he isn't a very good teacher
4.5,He is funny  plus He doesn't give much homework
2.5,Dr. Ballard has a dry sense of humor so he's sorta funny. Has a lot of class discussion and always plays devil's advocate! Tests are way too hard and he's a tough grader on articles.
2.5,No Comments
4.5,I can't believe he has a bad rating on here. I loved Dr. Sloan and he was always really eager to help.
5,Sloan is not only the best professor in the world  he is the best person.If you value truth  intellect  and sincerity  you will love and learn so muich from Dr. Sloan. He had done so much meaningful research and written so many books and articles. If you have the privilege of being in his class  you are lucky lucky lucky.
1.5,HORRIBLE!! I dropped this class a few weeks in and my entire load of the semester was cut in half. TOOOO much busy work and talk about BORING.
2,Sloan expects you to produce the best work of your college career when you have absolutely NO EARTHLY IDEA what the assignment is or means!!! Give me a break!
1,Sloan doesn't even give you a chance to raise your grade. I took this class senior year  missed two quizzes out of 6 and he told me to drop it or he would give me an automatic f. Sloan needs to give students some time. I was also a high B student.

5,Simply put: The finest history professor I have ever had.
5,Keine Sorgen mein Fruend!!Du wirst bestimmt eine bessere Stelle finden!!!
2,The classes he taught before getting finding out he's getting fired were amazing. Definitely one of the best professors. But he's gotten bad this semester. Can't blame him since he is losing his job.
4.5,Prof. Keller is a fair professor who values class participation. He's also willing to help a student out or be flexible if a student has problems.

5,Great Instructor  kind of a cone-shaped head though.
2.5,This guy was ok but you have to work hard. He curves tests which is his only saving grace. I have a lot of trouble sometimes because he was very unclear about subject matter but after all I guess its Economics.
4.5,If you show up for class and pay attention you can get a good grade in this class. Attendance is very important in this class. When a bunch of people skip class he sometimes gives additional points to people who showed up.
3,Nice guy  funny  hard to pay attention though
3.5,Very Easy Class makes it fun
1.5,technical
1,He doesn't explain anything. Most people get D's on the tests. Horrible teacher
4,Simple and easy to follow class. There are not a lot of things graded  just 2 group projects and two tests so it was quite easy to keep up with. The only mandatory attendance is when the group projects are presented.
5,Although his lectures are long and dry  Dr. Geib is good guy. In this class  you will give 2 presentations  write 2 research papers  2 terms tests/essays and 2 essay tests. He's super flexible and willing to help his students.
5,While Geib's class is very dry and can be somewhat long  he actually cares about his students and is always willing to help you out. He's a good guy.
4,Geib knows what he's talking about and is very passionate. Grades consist of 2 group presentations/papers  4 short essays  and 2 tests on important terms.
5,A really great teacher that really cares about the subject matter and his students!
4.5,Geib is a great guy and is very knowledgeable when it comes to management! The class is focused on two case study projects and two exams so there is not a whole lot of extra work other than these. His lecture and discussion sessions sometimes get a little boring  but overall it was a good class!
4.5,Geib is awesome! Basically there are just two projects and two test during class and the rest of the time is just discussion. This class can be an easy A if you show up and study whenever necessary (which is very little)
4.5,Nice Guy. Good teacher. Cares about his students and encourages everyone to continue their education past graduation.
5,good easy going guy... realy boreing tho you will fall asleep!! A++
4,Nice guy  easy going.
3.5,Geib is pretty easy  but his lectures are really really boring. SUPER nice guy though. Easy class to take if you can keep from falling asleep.
4.5,Nice guy  talks too much sometimes but is very knowledgable.
5,"Excellent Prof Helpful Knowlegable Knows how to teach Helps students Succeed Even helpful with improving your writing Travels widely Published Knows ""insider"" info on many businesses Great teacher and invaluable resource for students who want to learn & get ahead HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
4.5,He's an awesome professor. Very easy to get along with an interesting to listen to.
3.5,2 tests and 2 group research projects is all.
5,Geib is a ****ing genius!!!
2,Did not offer enough written assignments
1.5,I felt penalized for my opinions. The assignments required very little work but were graded harshly. The final exam was ambiguous. In the classroom I felt overworked and undervalued.
2,She is good intentioned  but she has pretty unclear assignments and doesn't grade easily. She is smart but the in class discussions are boring. I wouldn't recommend her for ENGL 14.
4,The readings for this class are a bit confusing and really theoretical  but she does a pretty good job going over them in class. 3 papers: rough draft for each  which are for credit and her feedback is helpful. In class thinking papers are the hardest part as she grades them similar to a real paper. Organized class  handwriting hard to decipher.
4.5,Prof Burnham is great. She is very interested in helping her students grow and learn. Go to her office hours because she is very helpful there.
4,She's a great teacher. She encourages class discussion and taught fairly well considering it was her first time teaching the course. TONS OF READING THOUGH...no real exams...final is a take home. Very fair grader when it comes to essays and she's always willing to help.
5,Great professor  she will really help you out with essays if you go to her office hours
4,She's a good teacher  but go to office hours  and ask her to help you with your paper. You learn more in her office than in class.A pretty meaty amount of reading  but not too bad.
4.5,Great teacher  leads discussions well. Fair grader.
5,She's difficult if you don't have a passion for english lit. She will realy teach you how to write well and she is a very fair and constant grader. No surprises
2.5,If you are a feminista who is tired of reading the important works of America's past  sign up for Michelle's class. It is difficult to make a class of alternative voices relevant and interesting  and this is no exception. I'm all for diversity  but the sad fact is that there just weren't very many interesting/well written pieces by women/american indians/slaves but you will read many by tem anyway.
4,Very intelligent lady- but you have to write the way she wants you to write. Seems like she's a bit bored with teaching but still an okay professor. Heavy work load  but a fair grader.
4.5,Great teacher overall
1.5,She is very dry and boring. The work is tedious  and she doesn't seem to bring any enthusiasm or real insight to the subject. Also  she told me I shouldn't go to grad school because I wouldn't make it. Guess where I am now.
1.5,Not a good professor - emphasizes obscurity of sources rather than quality  and is very unclear about assignments.
5,Dr. Burnham has an excellent grasp of the beauty and complexity of the romantic age of american lit.
5,This course was engaging and Prof. Hoyt is very well prepared for class. Make sure to read everything he tells you to read  it will help you with the pop quizzes. As long as you stay on top of things  you will do great in this course. Prof. Hoyt is also very understanding and cares about your opinions and thoughts.
4,He'll make you buy a book that you really should buy. I got it for $5 on Amazon. He tends to ramble and can be pretentious sometimes  and the three hour time slot is annoying  but overall I really liked this class. This convinced me to take more Phil classes. A quiz every class and a movie before all of them. I only wish it was earlier in the day.
2,Hoyt will have you read at least 25 pages for every class  however you will only ever get through about 2 pages worth of discussion. Rambles on and on. When asking questions is searching for something so specific he just keeps asking people until he gets close or we run out of time.
4,He is beautiful  but not hot. Get a grip  reviewers. We even had this discussion in class. He is very caring. He is willing to help. You are allowed flashcards on exams  but I did not find that helpful. His exams are very hard. I would be making a much better grade if it was not for the tests. You will spend lots of money on printing.
4,He's a good teacher and is really cool. He is hilarious and class is normally fun.
2.5,"There is reading every night. During almost every class  there is a quiz on what was read. Only two tests (midterm and final) and a few other writing assignments. Can be a very tough grader. Wants ""depth"" but wants you to be very concise too (very hard to achieve)."
3.5,He will work with you  but be ready to work
3.5,he's super cute and is really passionate about his courses. he expects a lot out of you so if you're willing to put in the effort it's well worth taking one of his courses. he's extremely blunt and has a fun approach to philosophy.
4,He is a fantastic teacher. Take him!!!
3,Personally he is an alright guy. But his grading is a bit ridiculous for a 100 level class  and he expects a lot from that kinda class. Its not the best class in the world  but if you read you may be okay. He gives a few essays over the course and if you can B-S it enough  and let him look at it you should be alright. READ EVERYTHING CAREFULLY.
2.5,Fun in class  but ridiculous grading.
2.5,I think he get's higher ratings because girls tend to think he's cute. He's an okay teacher (definitely not the best in the department) but I think he's a bit full of himself and pretty rude.
4.5,He is an awesome teacher that is passionate about the subjects in class. He def knows what he is talking about. He is helpful when it comes to writing the papers for the class. Papers are hard  but it is a 300 level class so that is to be expected. Also  for a bonus....he is really hot!
5,Dr. Hoyt is very intelligent and familiar with the class material. The material is not 'EASY' but he takes time to discuss and explain it until you get it. He seems like a very kind and sincere person. I think he is a great professor.
1,I like Hoyt as a person  and have a lot of respect for his intelligence. However  I think he might be the most boring philosophy teacher I've ever had. He talks so slow and quiet that you just don't pay attention. He could also make the most intense sex scandal seem abnoxiously bland and boring.
5,thumbs up
3,Beautiful with the brains to match... this is a hard course  lots of material and different ways of thinking  but I have loved every minute of it. He's hilarious and cynical and too damn normal to be a philosophy teacher. Good class  excellent teacher.. I'm happy...
4,had him for a few classes. i like his teaching style. he explains things in different ways to try and help everyone understand. if you struggle with phil  try harder or don't take phil classes. you just have to read and participate in the class discussions for any of his classes  and it will start to make more sense. def one of my fav profs.
4,I would take him again. Is that not enough? He has office hours  and is there  and will talk with you about concerns  projects  et c. Is that not enough? He knows what he is talking about. There. Take the class.
3.5,Hoyt is a good teacher. This class is a little difficult  especially if you take the honors level but the class is very helpful. It's not a normal philosophy class about your opinions. Its simply about logic and reasoning. Hoyt sometimes has diffficulty explaining the info  however this may be because the info is diffucult. I would take him again.
1,dude blows
3.5,lectures are very informative and interesting  doesn't want students to talk/interact. you write a lot even though not worth much towards grade. tests are okay  kind of hard ot study for.
4,Entertaining lecturer. Enjoyed his class very much.
4.5,Class was enjoyable. Shorr gets a bad rap for getting upset when students talk w/o raising their hands  but his lectures are involved and straight off the top of his head so he doesn't like being taken off track. Be a respectable student who pays attention and you'll do fine. He speaks fast so be sure you can keep up w/ note taking.
2.5,Mr. Shorr is a freak. He yells at students who don't raise their hands. I always felt scared to breathe  let alone speak. He has anger management issues and often seemed like he was about to pull a Dr. David Banner and turn green and rip his shirt off. Beware. I got an A  but it was an ordeal.
4.5,The 2 exam format seems to be a trend of history profs. The fact that he doesn't require you to talk is a bonus since you then get participation points for free. Raising your hand is a courtesy thing since I pay to listen to him and not someone that once took a trip somewhere. He's packed with knowledge and was fun to learn from.
1.5,this dude gave us like 2 tests the entire term and that was all of our assignments. He talked for about 3 hours nonstop without asking for any student participation. While he is a knowledgable teacher he doesn't know how to teach.
2,Mr. Shorr has interesting lectures  he knows his stuff. Don't worry too much about memorizing his lectures  study the guides he gives you and you will ace the tests. He is intimidating and likes to be the boss. Raise your hand and he wont yell at you.
5,Constantly singing  very active  brings tremendous energy to the classroom. Minimal pointless memorization and wasted time.
3.5,Heb is a great guy but not the best prof. You can learn from him but if econ is not your thing and you will need some better teaching you should try another prof
5,Heb is one of the best at AU! He not only is a professor but is also a business man. He knows his information! You can learn a lot from Heb!
2,This prof seems great at first  but ends up being terrible. He has one funny joke a class  but the rest is just rambling for attention.Because he takes so much time telling stories  when the test comes around you are clueless. Stay away from this professor
4.5,Very fun professor. He makes going to class fun and you still learn from him. He is also on the students side (ex. if you think you should have done better on a test  talk with him and he will most likely give you some extra points). I want to take as many classes with him as I can!
3.5,Heb is attrative  but still the wild child of the business dept. He is hilarious.
3,love this guy
2.5,No Comments
4.5,He is very helpful and is willing to give his time to you. He also lets class decide if they want to be there or not at times
3,do a diddy diddy dum diddy do...
4,He is an easy professor  but you have to follow the examples he gives. Sometimes they make sence to him  but just get everyone else lost. He is willing to help ouside of class  but good luck catching him.
3,funny

5,Great Prof  very passionate about what he teaches... and as a bonous  he is nice on the eyes.
5,It's a pleasure to add to the growing list of positive comments for this professor. He is among the most helpful  straightforward  and easygoing members in the history department.
5,Dr. Preston is without a doubt the best prof at UVic. He is extremely well-versed in his subject matter and can incorporate contemporary issues into any subject matter. TAKE A CLASS WITH HIM  he is probably the only prof worth your tuition!
5,Preston rocks my world! Totally intelligent  funny  engaging and involved teacher - The university is lucky to have him!
5,Really knows his stuff and really helpful
5,Preston is a great prof! He made American politics and history so great! I would recommend ANY of his classes
5,My fav class at UVic in the past three years. An awesome  interesting prof who really knows his stuff. He needs to teach more classes!
5,Preston was great! He is so helpful  I could talk to him for hours about American politics. He was so fascinating! A really down to earth  caring Prof.
4.5,Great Prof...probably the best at UVic.
5,His intelligence and personality is so sexy. Can't wait to take his Vietnam class next year. This guy rocks! By far the best prof I have ever had here at UVIC.
5,right now whoever gets him as a prof should feel lucky b/c he is definitely a step above the rest of the teachers here and i wouldnt be suprised to see him move on to bigger and better things soon...he used to teach at yale i believe.
5,Best proff of my university experience. Test can be very easy  if you study the terms he provides  and can link those terms and information in your essays on the test. Also  make sure you know big picture things  i.e. the effects of the New Deal.
5,Extremely intelligent prof! One of the BEST profs I've ever had. Classes are extremely interesting  but get ready to read A LOT. Expect to write a lot on the tests  but because he explains things so well  it's not as bad as it sounds. Highly recommended!
5,Great teacher! He made the course interesting  plus I got my first A! Highly recommended.
4,Geat Prof. He is by far the most intelligent prof I've ever had. Be prepared to read  ALOT. He's a very hard marker and expects you to participate in all discussions. His lectures are full of info.  so be prepared to write alot and quickly.
5,very smart  very helpfull  if you take his classes be prepared for a fair bit of reading but most of it is good
5,Great prof  tests are extremely fair  fun to listen to  and I only have one thing negative to say - lose the green cord pants!!!
5,dudes a good teacher  lol at las comment...he knows his **** like no other plus hes young and is one of those profs who is actually smarter than the students in his class...good dude
4,Good prof  but would be a GREAT travel agent.
1.5,Midterm was extremely hard. Doesn't clarify what you need to be studying at all.
1,This class seemed like a blow off class. There are barely any grades. We had like 3 assignments  a midterm  and a presentation. Attendance is what he grades on but it's only 10% of the grade. The midterm was outrageous and I'm pretty sure the average curve was 18-20%. He's the only teacher for this class  unfortunately. Nice guy though.
1,"This was the worst graduate class I have ever taken at Missouri State University. The professor has ""checked out"" of school and should not be ""teaching."" Please avoid this class if at all possible. I spent over 10 hours a week teaching myself and others."
4,Great Professor. Laughs at his own jokes. Pay for my accounting lab and use it!!!! He grades fair but does require you to know the material.
4,Good teacher. Didn't go on and on like some professors. Got the point pretty quickly.
1,Never prepared for class.
5,Excellent
2,He doesn't explain things clearly. Very boring.
5,Dudes from the Bronx so he dont play that lol. Next yr's gonna be his last so take him while he's still here. He's a great connect 4 letters of recc! As for the class  its straightforward & makes it super easy on us. He only gave 3 exams & he drops the lowest & doubles the highest. He's always available for help. He really cares about his students.
4,Also took Handy for eco301. His courses are very straightforward. Read  and you'll be fine. If you can't do well in this guy's course  you've got bigger fish to fry down the road  plain & simple.
5,great professor. helps you t understand the subject matter. Highly recommended
3,He is a great professor. He teaches somewhat fast but is honestly there to help you. He will make the class doable as long as you do your part. By far best teacher in the Economics Department
4,VERY cool teacher that you can relate to  his test are hard and you must put alot of effort to pass the class and understand the material
5,Great Professor
5,No Comments
5,Excellent professor  really cares about students gaining alot of knowledge from his classes. He was also very helpful.
4.5,No Comments
2,Labels all students to her general observation of the class.. not understanding about family emergencies
5,A truly student orientated and dedicated to the art of learning. A real class individual and consummate professional.
5,No Comments
5,Gretchen is a talented writer with a good sense of other works applicable to course material. Expectations are high  but usually so are results. Older women are hotter!!!!!
4.5,Is very helpful the entire way wants anyone who tries to pass with a B or better
3,I took this course in a freshman only class and he was trying to help us out but wasn't very successful. I definitely recommend the course mainly because of the second half of the semester project. The first half is all earth science and he tends to stop himself and restart a lot- he's kind of all over the place. Nice guy though  willing to help
1,I have never been more disappointed in my life. I have never met a more arrogant person in my life. I regret taking this class. This class and this professor are completely disjointed. To blatantly and constantly reject student opinion is NOT how you tech a class.
1,I have never known an educator more self-absorbed than Griffin. His classes  when not completely empty of substance  involve lectures pertaining to topics that only he would find relevant. No clarity in assignments or grading criteria. A discouraging presence in the classroom.
1,Quite possibly the worst class I've ever taken. His tests do not cover the material presented in lecture  he doesn't like athletes  and is unconcerned with 18 out of 21 people failing.
1,Terrible professor. Expected students to know information for tests that he didn't even teach about it. Awful grading system. I will never take a class with this professor again and advise no one else to either.
1,Hey was horrible  expected you to understand everything the first time he spoke of something. If you are struggling he makes things harder and expects more. If your an athlete DO NOT take this class.
4,Duane is a little quirky and kind of out there but overall a great professor. I took this class as a sophomore and expected to get my butt kicked. He's really helpful though and wants you to do well. He doesn't really give many grades and tests were very general. Field trips are interesting  definitely a lot of work but it could've been a lot worse
2,Grades harshly and not clear on all assignments. He clearly is very intelligent and expects you to understand everything you say the first time through. The class could have been really interesting but he ruined it. Oh  and DO NOT tell him your an athlete  you're guaranteeing a low grade from the start.
2,not clear at all about subject/grading
4,He is a really nice guy! If you try hard in his class and stay on top of the assignments he asks of you then you will seriously do well. Try to get on his good side  it pays off. He is a really smart guy and is very willing to help you out if you need. GO TO OFFICE HOURS! It makes him take you seriously and you learn a lot from his genius!
4,Take advantage of extra credit opportunities and office hours. There is a lot of material  but the tests ask about broad trends and general connections  so just memorizing isn't that helpful. He is kind of a picky grader. Field trips are kind of random but fun  and he has a lot of jokes and interesting stories  so the class is laid back and fun
3,such a funny guy  love him. he is a genius and is a bit confusing when he talks about the subject matter. he is really into what he teaches. as long as you try hard in the class you will do well even if you do bad on exams. show effort that you care about the class and meet with him though if you dont understand.
2.5,the whole time i thought i was going to fail and even considered withdrawing after basically failing all the impossible exams. However  he gives so many extra credit opportunities that only require your attendance and he makes group projects worth a TON so i actually ended up doing well in the class. His grades seem subjective. Just try hard.
1.5,DO NOT TAKE HIM IF YOU CAN AVOID IT. I'm a deans list student  great GPA and took him and it dropped my average significantly. If you just need a lab credit do anything else to avoid this- I'm so mad the reviews didnt warn me enough. People are right he is quirky and sometimes nice but overall his tests are impossible and he is not helpful at all.
5,great class. he never said hed curve the grades. high score earned in teh class sets the top of hte scale and its 10% down from that for each grade. totally fair but science majors set the top. i did ok xcept for the final. shouldve studied more cuz it killed me. learned a lot tho. makes you think.
5,Perhaps it's just the 231 class that is hard  because I don't know what everyone else is whining about. Duane is an absolute GENIUS when it comes to problem-solving and abstract thinking  and he looks at the subject matter in such an interesting  fresh way. He is a fair grader and it's not hard to do well if you study your book. And he's hilarious.
4,great class if you love weather. great prof if you want to learn. don't take if you're looking for an easy lab credit. his class really should be 300 level because its a serious science class. weather is a lot of physics. small number of engineers/science majors set the high grades and the rest of us got screwed.
1,this is the worst teacher I've ever had in my entire life. he was useless- DO NOT TAKE! he told us not to worry about our grades however he screwed us all in the end and gave us lower grades than everyone expected...AVOID AT ALL COSTS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD!
2.5,from what i gather classes before mine seemed to have taken advantage of duane  or at least he felt like they did. so then he made it too difficult...not worth the stress esp. if you reading humidity graphs and such is not going to be part of your life in the future. stay away.
2.5,cool guy  but we were told he would scale grades at the end (esp considering most of the class was getting 60/70 averages on the tests) but he didnt curve in the end. interesting class  but in the end it ended up hurting my gpa and just causing more stress in my life  not worth it if you're simply searching for another lab science credit
4,Dr. Rogers is one of the most encouraging  kind professors I have ever had and cares more about you learning the material than passing a test... which can be good or bad depending on how you look at it. Studying is all important
2,Dr. Rogers is a very nice person. Going to class helps out a lot because at the end of the semester if you're close to going up a grade he looks at attendance. He also gives extra credit opportunities through quizes at the end of the semester.
4.5,this class was hard. a lot of information. but he is willing to work with you  and he is always around in case you have questions. if you have to take this class  i strongly recommend taking it with rogers
5,He is a really good teacher. He gives extra credit and curves some test. He is there to help anyone who needs it. He uses powerpoint and that is super useful. His test are super hard but passable. You just have to study your but off  this class in general is not easy.
5,His lectures were clean and helpful. His powerpoints really help on the test and also his extra notes on web ct. Go to all the labs and stay after with him to help you in lab. He curves but the test are really hard.
5,Good professor. Very helpful and easy on papers. Tests are hard but not impossible.
5,I had him for A & P 1 and 2 in summer school. This class in summer school is the worst idea ever but he made the class so intresting! He is overly helpful  gives lots of extra credit  and loves going into detail to help everyone. HIGHLY RECOMMENED!! I have a better understanding of the classes im taking now from his class!!!
5,I think he is a great teacher and always willing to help you. This is not an easy class but he is the best to teach it. Be prepared to study a lot and work hard. Take him!
5,This class is super hard only because there is so much material if you arent intrested in studying all the time then you are in the wrong major. he'll tell from the get go there will be 1 or 2 As 3-5 Bs  alot of Cs and Ds and some Es. Unless you just do great on the test expect to fall into the range like everyone else.
5,By far the BEST teacher I have had at RU! He is amazing! He will help you out the best that he can...all you have to do is ask him for anything that you may need. TAKE HIM IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE ANATOMY!!!
4.5,Dr. Rogers is by far the best professor that I have had since I've been here. He is extremely helpful and the sweetest man ever. It is a hard class and you do have to work....but it's a hard class to begin with..VERY highly recommended
5,Dr. Rogers is the sweetest man ever. He is definitly willing to work with you if you feel you are behind. If you have to take anatomy  do your best to get him! ALL tests are multiple choice including lab practicals... as far as I know  the other teachers have essay tests. HE is such a sweetheart! and an AMAZING teacher!
5,Dr. Rogers is the best professor I've had so far. If you need help with anything  all you have to do is ask. The exams are very hard  but that is to be expected with an anatomy class. I thought the lab practicals were much easier than the lecture exams.
5,Dr. Rogers is the best teacher I have ever had. He is the nicest man and is always willing to help you anytime. His tests are hard but if you study like a week in advance you should do well. He is so cute and I definetly recommend him over any other teacher who teaches Anatomy and Physiology! :-
5,Dr. Rogers is extrememly helpful and if you go to him he will help you in anyway. I went to him so many times and he was so nice to me. If you show him you care  then he will help  and if you're not willing to talk to him then don't complain!
4,Tests are very hard. Need to study every little thing in your notes  it will be on there. Take lots of notes in lecture  I am in his summer class  almost 2 1/2 hours and on average take 8-10 pages of notes. Willing to help if you need it.
5,HES THE BEST TEACHER IVE EVER HAD  HOT TOO!!
5,Tests are hard but what else could you expect. He's very helpful  you just have to ask. If you are looking to know this stuff he's the professor to take.
2.5,he's ok. not as helpful as the others say he is. picks favorites.
4,I agree  Dr. Rogers is a great professor and I have learned alot from him. He is very willing to help  you just have to ask. He definately knows what he's talking about. I recommend him too!
5,Rich Bodek is the best teacher at this school. He is so intelligent and passionate about what he does and gets really excited when students are engaged. He really cares about students and doesn't have tests or quizzes  you just have to read every night. Its such an interesting class and he really makes you want to learn.
5,I took his class in the summer and hate history  but I loved this class because he was hilarious and told really funny stories about his life that related to the topic. He lectures a lot  but it's interesting because he's a quirky man! He's also a pretty easy/fair grader.
5,Dr. Bodek is very knowledgeable and his lectures are filled with anecdotes and details  they're very pleasant. Just keep in mind that you must take notes at all times because there is no textbook for the Weimar Germany class  other than two compilations of readings.
4,Excellent prof. I took it as a summer course and we had to jam through the whole course  but he kept things lively and even though he had so much material to cover in almost no time. I'd take his class again. He doesn't mind if you get the previous edition of the book either. Saved me $$$
4,Dr. Bodek is seriously one of the best professors at CofC. His lectures are amazing and his class was very clear cut. He can acknowledge when he's assigned too much work and doesn't mind moving assignments around to better fit the classes needs. I would take him for anything he offers.
3.5,I had Dr. Bodek for my FYSE-War  Trauma  and Culture and he was an awesome teacher. He is really enthusiastic about the subject and has a lot of knowledge about it. He is a very easy grader as long as you follow the simple criteria. A lot of reading was necessary but no tests or finals. Great teacher  easy class. Would definitely recommend.
5,Excellent professor. Really knows his topic  and imparts his enthusiasm to his students. Highly recommended.
4.5,One of my favorite teachers! He's so smart  really loves what he teaches  and will gladly help you if you go see him. The only downside is that he does assign a lot of reading.
5,Great teacher!!! Interesting lectures. 3 papers  no final
5,My favorite professor at CofC. He is brilliant  gives very interesting lectures  and is an all around great guy!! I wish I had more history credits remaining so I could take him again.
4.5,I learned so much!
4.5,hE'S THE BEST!
5,This was an Honors Special Topics Course  and it was amazing. It was discussion based and team taught. Dr. Bodek is one of the best teachers at the college. Very nice and very helpful. Really makes you think outside the box  and has really interesting ideas. Very animated and enthusiastic. Highly recommended for any honors class.
4.5,Very very smart. Basically knows everything about history and can answer any question. Doesn't give quizzes and assigned homework  so if you bomb a paper or test then you are done for. Participate in class because he likes that a lot. He will grade you on that and he will call on you even if you arent raising your hand. He's pretty funny too
2.5,Really a nice guy! I've taken him twice now  and just had a blast. Socialism was very difficult  a lot of the theory material was waaaaay over my head. But he will stop class to explain all material  and some side stories as well. Those are the best!! I feel like i learned more from discussion than actually reading. He's really a great professor.
5,Extremely nice man  very knowledgable and helpful. The class was somewhat difficult simply because it hops around so much  every week was not coherent at all  you never really know what hes going to talk about.
2,Very nice teacher  funny  always a discussion class. He brings viewpoints from theorists and get deep into their mind. You really are there for the teacher. The readings are sometimes difficult to understand.Not too structured of a class  always flips around subjects.
4.5,This guy was probably the coolest professor EVER! He knows everything about everything. Completely a people person  he seemed to know interesting facts about very uninteresting facts  the best lectures ever that required you to really think outside of the box. If you go to his office hours and ask questions  he'll help you lots.
2,He truly thinks we have nothing else to do but read one of the 6 assigned books  40 page chapters and internet reading every night. This man thinks our entire lives are history 102. The only part of the class that isnt terrible is the take home midterm and final. DONT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR unless you are a history buff who has no life
4.5,Really smart  funny guy. Excellent teacher  very knowledgeable. Expect to read A LOT  though. Our class didn't because of a bookstore issue  but traditionally he is very big on the reading.
5,What a nice man! He cares about his students and is so helpful with assignments. He is very approachable and wants to help you when you adk questions or need inspiration. I was out sick for a while and he was so nice about it. Definitely take him.
5,This is the second class I've taken with Craig and I have learned so much. He is a tough grader  but the very nature of sculpture is difficult. If your hard work is apparent  he will notice  but you have to really try to get an A in his class. Attendance is mandatory  like all studio classes  and final documentation is also a big part of your grade
5,Craig works hard at helping his students achieve thier maximum potential. You will get out of it what you put into it. I learned a great deal from him.
4,He is really nice and class is fun. However grades are just given on how he feels you did so make sure to try and show up to class. Not sure how hard he expects you to work but an A is very difficult to achieve.
4,Try as hard as you can. He grades on effort. If you do a lot  he notices.
3,Craig is hard to understand. At times he will go out of his way to help you. Then he will go off on you for the smallest things. His temper gets in the way of his teaching. I learned a lot from Craig  but the most important thing I learned was how not to treat people.
4.5,He has high expectations and a strict attendance policy  etc. But he knows his subject well and is really helpful if you show interest. If you follow the rules and actually do the work  you get a lot out of the class. I thought he was awesome and pretty funny sometimes too. If you want to take an art class  I'd recommend him.
3,its kinda hard to get an a in his class
5,LOVED this class. He is a great teacher and so much fun.

2,If you suck up  you'll do fine. Get on her good side. Listen to what she has to say and repeat it. Restate her thoughts in question form and you will get an A. Ask her about her childhood  marriage  and kids. Her birthday is Nov. 29. Remember that & throw her a party. This is how you will succeed in Gilpy's class.
1,She does not let you use big words. She is stupid and mean. She gets mad when you talk or try to have a little bit of fun. Not a good class.
1,All I hear all day is how she doesn't teach and how easy her class is. I wish that she would let us use our expansive vocabulary to further our education.
1,I am smarter than she is. She has a very little vocabulary. She is sarcastic in an annoying way. She should do students a favor by quitting.
1.5,Class is very interesting and challenging itself. Simply very frustrating to work with when he doesn't respond to emails and lesson plans seem to be made as he goes. Very bad on feedback throughout the semester as i never received my first test back or any labs to let me know how i was doing. Very  very frustrating.
3.5,Nice and funny guy! make the materials easier and fun to learn!
5,Clear lectures
4.5,I didn't think I would like this class at all  but it turned out to be one of my favorites. He has a good sense of humor and answered any questions clearly. The homework was tough and took a lot of time but doing it made the tests easy.
1.5,Professor Jeremy Van Antwerp spent the first 30 minutes of each 50 minute lecture talking about comic books and telling anecdotes. He did not seem to take his responsibility as a teacher seriously. He was rarely available for assistance with assigned material  and was generally unhelpful. In my opinion  he was immature and unprofessional.
4.5,Great Professor! His class isn't easy  but you learn a bunch. (which is the why you pay to go to school right?) Really helpful when you ask him questions in and out of class. Has a great sense of humor! Definitely would recommend!
4.5,Very nice guy with great intentions. Can learn a lot if you want to apply yourself otherwise expect a B.
2,His class was easy  but that's probably because ENGR 101 is easy. I still don't know how I did in the class  because he never gave us back our project grades! Very unclear when assigning things to work on and doesn't hand back things he graded. He's okay for 101  but I wouldn't want to take him for any other class.
3,I was expecting him to be really bad  but to my surprise I had a lot of fun in his class. He is always joking around. However  he does not seem very knowledgeable on the subject matter and his tests were tricky.
3.5,i actually liked vanantwerp this semester  despite all of the bad things i heard before. what everyone's got to know is that 209 is a tough class... but that doesn't mean the professor is bad. i thought he was a funny guy who really made the class fun. however his lab helpfulness could be questioned
1,Worst prof ever. Be prepared to learn everything on your own because he doesn't teach in class. I felt like I was in high school all over again trying to copy his notes from the projector. Avoid at all costs!
4,Not too bad. Corny jokes and Dilbert strips liven up class
4,Not that bad of a prof. A little boring but not too hard.
1,just plain boring
5,Clear explanations  good examples  really cares about his students.
3,i don't care what all these people say  he may be hard  but i liked him  he's funny in a geeky way. you just have to work hard  get on his good side  and your in like flint.
1,Very poor - its no wonder that our school graduates very few Chemical Engineers. Why? because he teaches the introductory ChE class!
1,He doesn't prepare for class  assigns problems that the book states are unsolvable  not to mention  when asking for help on homework  he takes off from his office at the time he told you to stop by! I don't learn a thing! He really needs to get a clue!!!
1.5,No Comments
1,absolutely awful. avoid him. he comes unprepared  bumbles around in front of class  and just reads the notes he displays on the wall over the lcd projector. he doesn't teach. i only go to class to fill in the blanks he leaves in the notes.
1,THE WORST CLASSES EVER. THIS CLASS IS THE INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH AND WRITING COURSE. BEWARE ITS A FLIPPED CLASSROOM SO WHOEVER YOU REGISTER FOR IS NOT YOUR PROFESSOR FOR THE WHOLE 15 WEEKS. BLANCK IS THE HEAD OF THE HISTORY DEPARTMENT SO FOR SOME REASON SHES THE ONLY ONE GRADING YOU MATERIAL. LOADS OF WORK  CONTRADICTIVE  NIT PICKY.
3,To be fair  I am rating Blanck on her Interdisciplinary Research and Writing class which is a co-taught class. You will get three professors  each for 4 weeks  focusing on a different subject. The class is awful. There is so much work with little communication between the 3 professors. Unfortunately it is mandatory for American Studies majors. GL!
4,Depends on her students way to much. If no one responds when she asks the class a question expect a long awkward silence. She does however make her lectures clear and is always there for you if you seek help in her class
3.5,Dr. Blanck is such a nice lady  but she's an okay teacher. She's really not BAD  but shes not the best. Her classes feel long and her lecturing isnt too great  at least in y opinion. She uses powerpoints a lot  but make sure you write down what she SAYS  too. Shes so nice and will help you with anything that you need  even outside of class.
4.5,She's really nice  and gives really good feedback if you ask questions. She assigns a considerable amount of homework  but it's manageable. But the 3 essays assigned in the course are a little tough so make sure you do them and put effort into it. Overall  good professor.
1,She gives a lot of work. She doesn't know how to explain things. And when you ask her questions she seems like she couldn't be bothered.
4,An awesome teacher who depends on her students too much. If the students don't feel like talking the class will drag on. Very sweet and easy to get along with but the class will drag if you do not participate. Lots of readings  but papers are clear and not too hard.
2.5,She is a sweet lady  but the most boring professor ever. Good intentions  but I would avoid her class at all costs  I fell asleep every class. I have no idea what the class was even about honestly...wish I didn't take her. It's a shame because she's a nice person  but not a very good teacher.
4,Very sweet lady. Her class is a little dry but it's the subjects you have to learn. Lots of group work/projects. No tests just a lot of papers/writing. She's very passionate about the material and that kind of gets in the way of her teaching  but she knows her stuff. Only 2 teachers for this subject and the other was much harder.
2.5,had her for historical methods. Not clear about what she wants from you. Gives busy work and is completely obsessed with slavery. I cant really stand the class but i heard shes the easiest of the historical methods teachers. She completely shut down my research topic idea and barely helped me find a new one. take someone else if you can.
5,She is a great professor. She's a very sweet person who is very knowledgeable. I have taken her twice and have had a good experience in both of her classes. Work load is fair  grading is fair. I would recommend her anytime!
4.5,She isn't to hard  have two read two short books for the class and although she tells you to red out of the main textbook I only did three times. Paper at the end of class based on document with presentation but it's not to bad. She's so nice but boring and is obsessed with slavery  take her if you have a moderate interest in History
5,I had prof. Blanck for American Studies. I was super intimidated when i first started the class. We had to buy a number of smaller books rather than one big text. The class to my surprise was pretty awesome and she is super helpful! if you ever need anything or have any questions she is totally understanding and helpful! great class and prof!!!
4,Dr. Blanck is a nice teacher but her class is difficult. There is a lot of work and reading for senior seminar. She wants you to learn and cares about her students. She will help you in any way possible to assist you in succeeding
5,Prof. Blanck is a great teacher. I learned a lot in her class. The work load was not heavy at all  pretty much just reading and online discussion. She wants you to learn!
4,i took her for intro to american studies. she gives a mini-quiz every week and you have one 6 pages paper & presentation to do. its not that bad. she is nice. although she does keep you till the end of class :/
3,i'd pass.
4,She's a tough teacher but if you do the work you are fine. Don't take her if you get bored during lectures because hers tend to drag on.
5,Dr. Blanck is so nice and always willing to answer any ?'s anyone ever has. You must do the readings each week for daily quizes and a final paper in which you incorporate an outside source not already used in class. Overall  very nice and loves promoting class discussion. A few chances for extra credit  but overall a good deal of work must be done.
4,Intro to American Studies isa very easy class. Only requires readings each week for a quiz and one paper. Very easy!
5,Dr. R is a gem in the EM program. He is a tough grader and is picky about what he wants  but he makes you work for your degree. Honestly he is not exactly an expert in the field of sport and music management but he will try his best to help you out and find people that can answer your questions. He really cares about his students. Get to know him!
1,He is so unclear about what he wants. He actually told us what he wanted for a project presentation  then counted us off when we presented saying he didn't tell us any of those things. He has no idea who you are even if you want to think he does. He could care less about you. He is the only teacher so it made me want to change my major.
1,He really knows nothing about what he is teaching  go back and get an accounting or marketing degree.
2.5,He's a decent enough teacher  although you will learn more through the assignments and research than from him and his lectures. Really tough grader on projects and papers and can be unreasonable. My main problem with him is that unless you are interested in venues or meeting/event planning he isn't really helpful outside of class.
3.5,He is a great teacher and you can tell he is very passionate about what he does. However  for the career profile and seminar he is super super nit picky about what he wants. Other than that  assignment in his class are just busy work.
3.5,A lot of work  but all worth it. Creates tons of opportunities to set you up for internships  and your future beyond school.
3.5,tons of busy work but it pays off. who cares what these other people are saying  the degree looks damn good on the resume. he knows nothing about sports..just learn on your own. good guy always willing to help.
3.5,Here is the thing. Yes  he is a hard teacher  but if you want to be a manager in an entertainment industry  the type and amount of work he makes you do  you will probably do 10 times more in the real world  unless you want to be a secretary for the rest of your life. Yes  it's busy work  but it prepares you.
4.5,These comments are clearly from people who don't want to put in the work. If you really want to major in EM and it's the right place for you  you will enjoy Dr R and his courses. Loves what he does and definitely gives a lot of work but it all has a purpose and I'm better for it all.
2,This man makes you NOT want to be an EM major. This class seems to drag on for hours at a time and if it weren't required to be there I would skip a lot. Material is outdated  irrelevant  and not useful to the current world. This guy is a self-centered jerk  he has his favorites and if you aren't one of them  best of luck to you!
1,i took this guy 6 years ago. Get out of this major if possible. He is an idiot and uses the information that the students from previous years researched. does not check for facts  and grades solely on presentation  not content. he will not help you do anything in the entertainment industry that you could not have done without a college education
2.5,As others have stated  there are rediculous amounts of work for what you will get out of it. It is hard to teach something that you have never been involved in. Much of the material we went over was not relavent  plus outdated. EM majors must take him so don't waste your time with a EM major. Both classes were a waste.
2.5,You have no choice if you want to be an EM major... you HAVE to have him as your teacher two times. Either switch majors or suck it up. Yeah  he gives entirely too much busy work... but it's easy. You just have to memorize slides/in class work for tests. Just do what he says & you'll be fine.
1,Dr. R is an absolutely ridiculous teacher. I thought that I was actually going to learn something different by having this major and I haven't. You basically get a management degree and take 2 extra classes where you read some articles about Music  Sports  Event and Venue Management. All the other classes are electives and have nothing to do with E
4.5,If you go to class and do the assigned work you will most likely get an A. Dr. R is absolutely not as bad as everyone else is saying! The class is fine  he is a nice guy  and it's not hard to do good.
1,This is probably the most useless class I have had in my school career. DO NOT take this class  the major is worthless and you will learn nothing about the entertainment business. The professor isn't qualified to teach pre-school.
1.5,It's all busy work with outdated reading and over loaded tests-there are only two. Shameless self promotion of his wife and God. Has yet to respond to any of my emails and his GA's do all the work. I considered changing my major-but this is the general opinion of others involved in this major.
2,When I didn't drop the class like he asked me to he treated me with sarcastic politeness. He is unorganized  unreasonable  manipulative  and basically a jerk. He acts like he wants to help the students  but he is never genuine. His lessons are fine  but I will never take another class with him as a teacher.
1.5,He will hold a grudge if he disagrees with your views. 90% of what is taught in class really did not pertain to the entertainment industry today. Was not prepared for class  and when I went to his office hours for help he brushed me off saying  ?You need to go research this more.? I had to go to another professor to help me work though the problem.
1,Rothschild will only accept things his way. He rarely updates grades on bb. However  I learned a alot and would take him again.
4,"A ""capital markets"" class that only covers fixed income - so the last unit is entirely esoteric derivatives material. He is very smart and an excellent teacher but the material is simply too complex for an average finance student. Memorize the problem sets and pray on the multiple choice. You don't need a textbook"
1,This was has been my worst class at Alabama. During the class lectures Dr. Ligon read verbatim from the powerpoints. These powerpoints were directly from the book. Making them hard to understand. He speed reads through every slide to just get it finished in the lecture time. He barely went over the math questions and expected you to learn them.
2,Ligon is just one of those teachers you don't want to take but have to. He doesn't have any interest in whether his students really understand or not. He speaks above you and looks at you like an idiot if you ask the wrong question. Spend a few weeks before the exam memorizing the 60 review problems to just get by with a B
4,While he is the very image of the aloof professor  he is fantastic  guiding students through highly dense materially and demanding as much of himself as his students. Probably the hardest course I have taken on a day-to-day basis  but also one of the most rewarding.
5,Good professor. Material isn't easy but he lets you know what he requires from you.
5,Brilliant. Best teacher at UA
5,I had JL for Microstructure.He is an awesome teacher.He presents material in a clear manner holds interesting discussions and then holds the students responsible for the material(all of the material)covered in class.He's not easy  but he's one of the best
4.5,No Comments
2,Quantitative investment analysis is hell
4.5,he's so cool
5,She is an absolutely phenomenal professor. I really felt like I was taking a stimulating class with someone who is truly passionate in both her field and students. In class discussions  student ideas and opinions are both valid and encouraged  and out of any class I took this is the one that I always wanted to go further with. Take her classes!
5,(18th & 19th Century British Literature) By far the best professor I've had at Denison. She inspires you to think critically with T&T's  which are extremely  but essential in making you think deeply about the topic. I have never devoted so much time and thought to a course in my life.
3.5,She's very smart  but her classes focus more on discussion than lecture. In another subject that might have been helpful  but in a Brit Lit survey class  I would have preferred to hear more of what she had to say and less of my classmates' opinions.
4.5,Dr.Tromp is a very passionate person. Her lectures are very involved  and she goes out of her way to make you want to do better. Her enthusiasm  both in person and when grading  made me nostalgic for high school days. I  however  lost interest in this subject due to the content covered  not how she taught it.
5,LOVE! She is definitely the best professor I've had at Denison. She is super interested in the material and gets you interested even when the material can be very tedious. Great class I'd suggest her to any and all students. Side note I liked her so much I made her my advisor and she teaches the farthest thing from my major.
1.5,She's very popular  and I've never understood why. I found her class tedious and her style annoying. She's also quite arrogant.
5,Tromp is one of those professors that I encourage EVERYONE  regardless of their major  to take before they graduate. She forced us to take a seemingly simple subject and wrap our minds around it in a way most students have never considered. Her classes are fun  stimulating  and generally unbiased. Do the work with pride and you'll do fine in class.
5,Incredibly intelligent and engaging - fair and very accessible. Genuinely passionate about the subject matter and truly concerned about her students. Challenging but very reasonable and willing to help however possible.
5,I think I took as many classes as I could with Dr. Tromp. She taught me how to write and how to think in the most creative and intense way. Engaging  intuitive professor.
5,No Comments
5,Do your work and you will love her.
5,Professor Tromp made me want to talk in class  something that no previous professor had ever done. Learning actually became fun with her.
5,Dr. Tromp is wonderful. she will challenge you  but especially if you are thinking of graduate school or honors project  take classes with her!
5,Dr. Tromp is a great professor. She is very engaging and is always willing to meet to discuss papers  thesis  or any problems. She is sometimes hard to track down but when you find her  she is all answers.
5,No Comments
4,one of the most intellectually stimulating professors i've had. she will really make you think about things you've never thought about before. difficult and challenging  but you learn a lot of you're willing to put in the work.
1.5,She misleads you. She doesn't follow through.
3.5,She is so lucid  gentle and playful. One feels as though one were accompanying her on a joyous and novel journey through the ecstatic maze of the Phenomenology.
4.5,Incredible lecturer who demystifies and brings infectious excitement to Hegel's Phenomenology  which to newbies is incredibly dense  dry and intimidating. Was frustrated and confused for every reading but in class she made it totally engrossing. Is very friendly one on one  very helpful if u contact her even about doing poorly or missing deadlines.
4,Her class was extremely difficult and dense but if you do the readings and engage with it then she's a really great teacher. Her intelligence is intimidating at times but she doesn't do it on purpose  she's just actually that smart.
5,Rebecca Comay is eloquent and brilliant. Her instruction in the Hegel course got me far beyond my expectation. The bitterness towards her coherence must be from some combination of a reluctance to read and a small vocabulary.
3,I never heard a satisfactory syllogism or argument on any topic outside of her lectures and I still doubt that her phenomenology course would score very highly in the perception class over at psychology. I haven't been able to subscribe to this proff.'s big money course in advanced tautology  which is WAY too abstract for me to handle.
4.5,Extremely clear  yet very challenging. She is very captivating if you've read the material and are determined to understand. Hegel's Phenomenology is arguably the most impenetrable text in history  so I attribute my little grasp of his philosophy entirely to her instruction.
2,I only occasionally knew what she wanted to talk about  and her syllabus lacked focus. She wanted to talk about too many different things  with the result that the course lacked coherence. Her lectures alternate between interesting and terribly boring  as she has a tendency to go off on unrelated tangents.
1,One of the worst Professors i've ever had. Her run on sentances make it nearly impossible to understand anything she says. She speaks like she is attempting to show off her vocabulary to the students she is supposed to be teaching. I suggest avoiding any class she teaches.
2,Comay's vocabulary is very rich however that makes trying to understand what she is saying harder because you are focused on her words more than the content. The lectures were mostly boring and her constant hitting the mic though annoying startled you awake.
1.5,Professor Comay focuses on Nietszche  Freud and Marx ONLY and you can't understand anything she says. Her tangents make it very difficult to pay attention. Lectures are brutal and not falling asleep is a chore. Good luck
1,"everyone who thinks this woman is brilliant is horribly mistaken. her lectures consist of run-on sentences composed 90% of adjectives which are similes of each other. ""this passage is strange... mysterious... illuding... conspiratory..."" if that is what it means to be brilliant  then brilliant is the last thing i would ever want to be"
3,Basically  as everyone else already said--- unapproachable. Indubitably intelligent. Her grading's not too hard  since I eventually did get end up with an A in the class  with this extremely difficult material. But jeez....She told me to fear her!
5,Take a class with her. It will blow your mind.
3.5,No Comments
1.5,completely changed the announced readings first day of class (to proust only)  doesn't know students' names or engage in seminar discussion  least approachable prof I've had  SEEMS smart to some  but ultimately only repeats herself over and over in more complex sentence structure and flowery vocabulary.
5,Rebecca has a brilliant mind  she gives great lectures. Regardless of what others say  I find her very approachable. And  yes  she deserves a chillie pepper 
5,Not for the lazy or uncommitted  but incredibly rewarding if you put in the work.
4.5,one of the most exciting profs at U of T. and that's not just because she's so hot. which makes me wonder - where are all her chili peppers?! is anyone more deserving?
1,Good god  I've never met such a self-absorbed professor. Yes  she has ideas - but she's not a teacher. She is unapproachable  and I wonder what exactly she says to herself each Tuesday evening when coming to class because it's obvious she does not want to be around us or TEACH us for that matter. She repeats too much - as if we're ignorant children
5,No Comments
3,He made me hate international politics. Should not be teaching lower level classes.
5,Andy Katz is a great guy  and the classes I took with him were some of the best experiences I had at Denison. He's very personable  and gets you to really engage with material. He's also quite available outside of class  and I'd suggest dropping in on office hours just to talk  not even about class. You won't regret taking a course with Katz.
5,Awesome fellow
4.5,Although he is a hard grader  Katz is very personable and enthusiastic--it has been a pleasure to have him as a teacher. Would highly recommend.
5,Dr. Katz is an amazing teacher. He is engaging  witty and cares about his students enough to have stimulating lectures. DO THE READING  b.s-ing your way through discussions does not work with him. He will push you  and it will not be an easy A. That being said  you will be better for it. You will learn more in class guaranteed. A MUST TAKE PROF!!!
4,great man. witty and intelligent professor. really makes you think. highly recommended.
5,Andrew Katz is a saint. He is hands down Denison's greatest asset and greatest professor. Do yourself a favor and take one of his classes. He'll make the subject matter more interesting than you ever thought possible. Sometimes you're a nut  sometimes your not. Cheers to you  Andy.
4.5,took him freshmen year  liked him so much that I asked him to be my adviser. You will work and he will call you on B.S. answers  always witty and friendly. Great as an adviser  cares about you as a person. DO THE READING!!! Cramming is useless  especially against Katz. Not deadly workload but you will be challenged. mix of lecture and discussion
4.5,Katz is one of the best professors I've ever had. Incredibly helpful and nice  both personally and educationally. Very very funny and presents material in an interesting way. VERY hard grader.
4.5,He is a teacher that makes class fun  interesting  challenging  intellectualizing stimulate  and entertaining at the same time. He balances his class between lecture style and class discussion based.
5,He is an amazing professor. He's a hard grader but doing well in the class makes you feel good about yourself. He is helpful and easy to talk to. I highly recommend him as a prof!
5,AMAZING Professor! Honestly one fo the BEST I've ever had. Polisci isn't my major  I signed up for the class because I needed a fourth class. I went to meet with him before and he was great  nice and passionate about teaching as well as the topic itself. Easy to ask help  kept my attention  learned more than any other class I've taken!
5,great prof
5,wonderful professor and probably the smartest man on campus. Do your reading and contribute daily and you will be fine  never make fun of his kids.
5,Katz is the man! He is the best teacher I have ever had on any level. He is funny  knowledgeable  open  challenging  genuinely interested in his students  and everything else that you would ever want from a professor. He will quickly learn everyone's name and make them feel at home. Do your reading. You will not regret it. He will connect it later.
5,best teach in polisci dept
5,Best professor I've ever had-period-. Class was demanding but interesting and when you get an A you know you've really earned it. Great guy personally  too. Take everything he offers  Denison doesn't have much else to offer!
5,Smart  funny  and engaging.
5,The best professor at Denison.
3.5,He's a great teacher  but a little too much attention to the ladies in the classroom.
5,He was an awesome teacher. Very clear and concise with his instruction. He was intolerant of students who didn't pay attention  but it was the students fault for not paying attention. I would take all of my future classes with him. Period.
1.5,"Drop the ""f bomb"" a lot. Unprofessional  disrespectful  immature    and yes I am speaking of the teacher. Got a B in the class  but teacher pretty much blows."
1,He is also listed AS LUKE BROWN. Listen to these raters. This guy is a time bomb waiting to explode - on you  the class. Give imm. quiz when he hears a cell phone. Won't explain projects  marks absent if tardy  belittle's you when you speak incorrect mathematical grammar. ALL BUT 10 PEOPLE DROPPED CLASS BY WITHDRAWAL DATE. 8/10 LEFT FAILED CLASS
1,I like the guy as a person but not as a teacher. He makes you think and if you simply don't get it  he makes you feel dumb. I never made anything higher than a 60 on his tests and I love math and have always been good at it. Do not take if you're not a math genious.
2,trust me  im not one of those spoilt brats that like easy work or need my fone in class  but this guy  no!! do not take him.. his math classes make u feel dumb and stupid and he insults his students indirectly  i do not blame all the people who dropped his class  even if you are a math genius  ull hate math for the rest of your life.. DONT TAKE HIM
1,No Comments
1,This guy sucks at life. If your a math genius then you'll be fine. I got an A in college Algebra  but i had to drop his class. he is super strict on thing like  phones  behavor  and tarties. Blows by everything really fast. Will help u if u ask but still explains everything fast and makes you feel dumb and treats u like ur not trying in the class
4.5,Easy Class Easy Professor. He tries to joke with the class 2 add humor. Likes ppl 2 participate. NE problems ask & he will help. Do reviews homework & take notes ull b fine. Easy way to make an A. Qt in a hat oh ask him to wear a skirt lol LB is the best!
1,"A total ****. Gives reviews that are completely different from the test. If you don't know math  you will not learn it from this ""teacher."" Belittles students and has a real attitude and temper. Should be fired yesterday. 30 people started and 9 hung on. Now I get to take Col Alg again. Thanks."
1,"The worst professor anyone could ever have. His attitude stinks  his ""projects"" are hard and sometimes he talks about things that are not even in the book. If math is not your best subject  DO NOT TAKE CLASS WITH THIS GUY. I now know why people hate going back to school."
5,"Hahaha guys pls give him a break. Math isn't an easy subject.First  you all should admirer him for being ""smarta$$"". Second  you should spend more time to study rather than sitting here complaining about him. He's a great professor. Although LB isn't a hottie but he's definitely a cutie[sometimes:)"
1,IF you want a teacher who is polite and respectful to others  then professor Brown is NOT the teacher for you. Take his class if you want a professor who acts too PUNK ROCK for the whole world  talks to the ladies  believes he is god and we are all his servents  and is a total geek... then take him!
1,extremely immature
1,I got an A in College Algebra and when I got to his Calculus class  I had to drop out because he was so hard and I have always been a good math student. He isn't helpful when we make suggestions  and if your phone rings he snaps and gives a HARD pop quiz!
1,Worst teacher ever. treats people like they are stupid  when he doesn't know anything himself. 7 people left out of 32 by the end of the year. If you want to work hard and get an F take this rude guy.
1,Not a good teacher at all. Talks to students as children when he is the same age. Thinks he is better then the whole wide world. Still stuck in the Nirvana rock scene when that died out ten years ago. Never take this him for any class. WORSE EVER  UNLESS YOU WANT TO FAIL.
1,he is the worst teacher ever out there. if you want to hear the F..k WORD ALL THE TIME you want to take him. i was in a class of 24 students and just 6 people survive. the attitude of this teacher is the worst ever. expect that when taking this class. WE CAREFULL AND GOOD LUCK!!!
1.5,He talks to fast while your writing down your notes. That means that while you are writing the notes from the boared you are missing out what he is explaining. That means you can not learn anything. I always came out of his class frustrated because I could not get anything what he was saying.
1.5,more than half the class withdrew
1,Could not write any faster. Very unhelpful  poor attitude towards teaching probably wanted to be something else than a teacher. Childish in his actions and word. REALLY BAD TEACHER
2,Xenophobic  self-centred  proud of himself whereas he's considered by his peers as a martian who is more interested by his glory than the success of his students.
4,incredibly knowledgeable  this man really makes you learn. Exposed me to a side of the world and another way of life all in one class. Very helpful outside of courses  he even helped me with projects for other classes. Though there's no assigned readings and not as much material as I might've wished gets covered I still reccomend taking his class.
3.5,Loved him! He totally reminded me of the father off of My Big Fat Greek Wedding! He was a little random at some points but you just had to pay really close attention.
1,This jury is still out on if his classes are either scatered thoughts of a pure genious or the rantings of an insane man.
2,Knows his stuff but worst prof I've every had. A complete nutter. Goes off topic all the time about subjects outside of the course  and makes wide sweeping comments. Rants every class about how wrong Western society is and what a utopia China was. Some comments border on insulting. Thinks the CIA is out to destroy China. Avoid if at all possible.
1,Second only to Walker in bad history profs. Scattered and unclear  and his French accent makes it impossible to understand anything. Also screws up names and dates all the time. I leave class more confused then when I go there. He seems like a decent guy  but nonetheless  should be writing books not lecturing.
3,I loved his classes. They were interesting and despite what some people said  he really knows his stuff. The only complaint I have is that he didn't assign any reading  which made catching up with the book a little tough.
2,Well  attend the class  but sleep  the finals is 100 multiple choices and u get the answers before hand =p
1.5,Very unclear lecturer. He messes up the dates often and his lack of clarity makes it extremely hard to understand what he is lecturing about. I recorded lectures and still had problems figuring out what he was talking about. Exam was easy. He gives you 5 of the final multiple choice quesions at the start of each class.
3,Wow  how could you say he knows nothing about chinese history? Possibly the smartest prof i have ever had. He does struggle at keeping his lectures clear  but that's not his problem  it's yours. He's extremely smart and his tests and exam are easy.
1,"Can barely speak English. Doesn't know anything about course material. Gives no page references to decode his impossible lectures. He once said  and I quote... ""Mandarins can't be lazy  like Mexicans who sleep under trees all day"". But it's not worth the agony and confusion. AVOID HIM AT ALL COSTS."
1.5,"Impossible to understand...it gets tough when he starts referring to dates (ie. he says ""600"" for both 600 and 1600). Lectures don't seem to flow  & he goes off on tangents every so often. But at least the format of the final (100 mult.choice) l"
2,he is crazy. absolutely crazy. i can understand his french better than his english. He is a distinguished prof emeritus  but to most of us he was crazy. However  the course was DAMN easy (the final was just 100 mulitple choice  we were given 80 in clas
1.5,This man knows NOTHING about Chinese history. His lectures are unclear  and cannot field question from students. Very arrogant  and unaccomodating. The department should look for a new prof to take over the Chinese history courses.
4.5,Entertaining. Helpful. Responds quickly to emails. Seems to like what he's doing (which is rare!) I looked forward to going to his class.
3.5,No Comments
2.5,No Comments
5,a lot of technical help with stories  not the vague emotional stuff that you get in many creative-writing courses. unlike most Rice classes  this one is a good place to make friends. it's always fun  and it creates a community of serious (or semi-serious) writers.
4.5,Awesome teacher... brilliant  and fun to have in class.
1,Stop! Please don't take ANY of this man's classes. Words to describe his classes Boring  Pointless  Confusing  Long  Boring  and Annoying. He is a nice enough man and even nicer when he is imposing his ideas and beliefs on you during ever class.
1.5,He is very hard to listen to  until he gets to talking about his own research  then it's easier to stay awake. Go to his office hours. Covers the same things in every class  but not clear in class on what exactly he wants you to know.
1,Jerome Taylor is the worst teacher I have ever had for the following reasons: 1. he comes ten minutes late to every class  2. he talks in a incomprehensible monotone voice so its impossible to stay awake in class  3.he is extremely disorganized  4. he missed the final  forcing us to take an incomplete grade & take the final next semester.DONT TAKE
1,He was an hour late for our final  and I had a plane to catch. A majority of the class left and had to get an N grade until taking the final once spring semester started.r A lot of the material is on research he's done himself so there's no way of getting around having to know everything. Don't read the book... it won't do you any good. Don't take
1,hes a very nice guy but honestly the most boring class ever. he talks so quiet and slow you can't understand anything he says and he writes on the board you wont be able to read any of it. his class makes no sense because he just throws things together and no one has any clue what hes doing DO NOT take him as a teacher.
2,AVOID AVOID AVOID!! VERY UNORGANIZED AND RANDOM.LATE ALLTHE TIME. YOU'RE LUCKY IF HE SHOWS UP FOR THE FINAL EXAM. TALKS WAY TOO LOW AND SLOWLY. LECTURES DO NOT COINCIDE WITH THE READINGS. GRADES EXAMS HARSHLY. HE MAKES THINGS MORE DIFFICULT THAN THEY HAVE TO BE AND IT'S ONLY A 300-LEVEL CLASS
1.5,Dr. Taylor's class is very BORING! Do Not Take! The material is quite interesting  yet he conveys it in such a confusing way! You might study hard  but he grades in an odd manner. Have to memorize statistics out of book! Talks extremely low  so you have to sit close. You're lucky to get an A!
1,I am currently in hell in this class. Not only does he look like a St.Bernard  but he speaks very slowly and quietly and takes lots of pauses in his sentences. It's hard to pay attention. You probably won't be too motivated to go. It's boring and the midterm is the first test of the semester.
2,This teacher has no grading system. You will not receive ONE single grade in his class and he randomly picks grades out for his students at the end of term. If you like to gamble take his class!
3,I had Dr. Taylor for Intro. to African American Family. While the course material was very interesting  the professor was not always clear. I enjoyed the class because of the course material and Dr. Taylor is a very intelligent man who offers alot of useful information to his students. I would only recommend this class to dedicated students.
4,Got an A
1,This class may seem easy at first. But He makes it so much harder than it has to be. He pauses all of the time and never gets to his point. Be careful...and the readings never correspond with class lectures!
1,I hate him.. you get like 3 grades per semester so if you **** up once  it's over
3,Nice guy  smart guy  but doen't explain concepts well. His class is deceptively difficult because it seems easy at first. Be ready to pull up pants and put your hard hat on because YOU WILL WORK. He is a tough grader and if you got an A in his class (like me) you truthfully earned it.
2.5,The material learned is very interesting  but it takes a long time to get to the point. Has long pauses in the middle of sentences. Workshops can be fun-only if those in the class make it fun. The class is needed to debate & speak up to make things interesting. So get to know your classmates soon
1,African American Families could have been an interesting class but Jerome Taylor really isnt a good teacher. I do not suggest taking this class. dull  unclear  and just generally frustrating.
3,Very nice but confusing way of teaching. Talks to low and too many long pauses. Very roundabout instead of straight to the point and doesn't go over what is going to be on the exam just say study everything! Lets students participate to much that he gets off track and waste class time.
1.5,He knows so much and is such a nice guy that it is a shame he cannot relay the information to a class full of eager students. He has too much going on outside the classroom - studies  research  etc. Very meticulous grader.
1,Sex and Racism with this professors was the worst class I ever had. Some people arent meant to teach and Jeromoe Taylor is one of them.
3,Always read the pre-lab practice quiz questions.
1,"I am a Genetics major and science is the love of my life. This awful teacher left me wondering whether I should even be in the field of science after every class. She is horrible  sarcastic  soul-eating  and her ""revered"" lab manual is the stuff nightmares are made of. My only recommendation is that if you don't have to  DO NOT take this class."
2,No class will ever be harder than this. It is not difficult subject matter at all  but the format is bizarre and every point matters. The lab manual is full of typos and straight errors. The quizzes are over the most obscure parts of the lab manuals. Come to lab organized  study for quizzes  and don't forget LON-CAPA and you will be fine.
1.5,Professor Iten managed to make me dread bio lab every single week  and she was barely in the room during lab. She wrote the lab manual  which made simple concepts overly-complicated and lab procedures convoluted. They grade the lab on accuracy rather than effort even though the point of the course is to gain familiarity with lab. Overall
5,Best professor i have ever had  if had a chance  please take a class with her
1,Dr. Iten loves to complicate everything. She also loves to waste time on clicker questions. In order to get done on time  READ the manual and do ALL calculations before going to lab. Understand exactly what you'll be doing in lab to also make it easier. Look at the sample in-lab problems because they are the exact same.
2,READ THE MANUAL! As long as you show up to lab  you should be able to earn an A or B on the lab  but the quizzes are what will bring your grade down drastically. Make sure the read the manual carefully before class and go to the Biology Resource Center for any help. Know how to do any calculations because those are a good chunk of the quizzes.
3,Upon meeting Dr. Iten she can seem rather intimidating but you need to go introduce yourself. I struggled at the beginning but then realized that If I just start preparing at least a week in advance  it is so possible to do well. Dr. Iten and the lab manual both put on a scary front but she makes a way bigger deal of it than it really is.
2.5,This class was not easy. It is definitely the weed-out course for biology freshman. The main key to doing well was starting off strong. Don't wait til week 3 to start reading your manual and the blog or looking at the sample in-lab quiz questions because it will hurt you. You can do well if you're willing to work for it though!
2.5,With the right amount of studying and effort  you should do well in this class. You have to be well prepared for each lab because you work individually  and most labs do not leave enough time for one to fix an error. Overall  it was annoying to put so much effort in the class  but by the time you finish the class you will know the bio lab  well.
1,Professor Iten wrote the lab manual for her class  hence why the labs are extremely confusing. The book is full of typos and wrong calculations  unfortunately this class is required for biology majors so there's no way around it.
4.5,Very useful information learned during class.
1,This class is way more difficult than it needs to be. The manual is very hard to understand  and you get absolutely zero help from the staff.
2,Dr. Iten isn't the best professor around. You only see her at the beginning of class when she wastes the lab time you have answering questions with clickers. The lab manuel is kind of hard to understand and there are many spelling and grammatical errors in it.
1.5,this lab course is way more difficult than it needs to be! she makes herself so unapproachable  but don't be intimidated because the only way to do well is to ask a TON of questions whether you contact her or your TAs
3,There is barely any interaction with Prof Iten.. the class is completely handled by the TAs. Do the pre labs  fully read and understand the lab manual  and go over the practice quizzes and you'll be fine. Not as bad as some people on here are saying it is.
1,Prof was only present at the beginning of class and did virtually nothing to help us understand the material. The textbook (which can only be bought from her and has no resale value) literally contradicted itself and made understanding simple things impossible. In addition  it was ripe with simple spelling mistakes. Overall  it was a bad class.
4,This is really a difficult class  but if you can keep up each time  you will get at least B in BIOL 135. Keeping touch with your TAs are extremely important.
1,She was never actually in the class. The TAs were good about helping  but I had zero contact with Prof. Iten all semester.
1,She is rude and unwilling to offer any excuse. Being an international student I was totally lost in her class. She is a strict lady which is nice but i dont think anyone feels comfortable in her class. Please avoid her class at all costs!
1,MEAN MAN  the worst at U.O.  changed my major at UO
1,Frishkoff is one of the biggest ****s I've met in my entirety  seriously  didn't make the class fun  interesting  or anything worth coming to. The worst teacher at the University of Oregon
1,No Comments
5,Simply one of the most amazing classes and teachers I have ever encountered. He may be a bit bitter  slight charming. But the guy knows his stuff and will shake up your world a bit. Don't be suprised to see the class party together  cry  smile  and laugh.It completely changed my major and my life
1,mean spirited old man- he should be an accountant
3.5,This was a very difficult class to take as a freshman. Although he was harsh to deal with  I needed a slap of reality while transitioning schools settings. I felt a sense of accomplishment when I was done. He really is a nice man when he's not teaching.
1,Horribly mean teacher who only criticized his students  couldn't even remember who the twenty people in his class were  made us where name tags  and had harder course material in a freshman seminar than upper level classes!
1,Terrible professor. His lecture slides are random quotes pasted from a journal abstract  and to learn anything you need to read all the journals. Is it laziness? probably. If you like reading 10 journals per lecture  leaving more confused after asking him a question or being stood up at his office hours take a course with mccarthy
1,THIS MAN SHOULD NOT BE A PROFESSOR
4,Absolutely amazing professor! A wonderful person as well! Labs are very easy marks and his exams are extremely fair! :)
4,Dan is a really polarizing character. If you participate in class and ask intelligent questions he is very willing to help you succeed. His lecture style is really quite strange but I really enjoyed his classes.
5,Professor Dan is amazing. I understand sometimes he can seem as though he goinf off into a completley different topic but in the end it all relates. He is helpful  passionate  kind and caring when it comes to the subject at hand and his students. He one of the best profs at brock i throughly enjoyed his teaching style and him as a professor!!
1,My least favourite prof EVER!! I am an earth science major and luckily I have choice in classes and will NEVER take another class with him!! He is very smart but does not know how to teach. You have to go to class since lecture notes online are not helpful and for a textbook it was a bunch of different books on reserve.
1,This is by far the worst prof I have ever had. He is smart but doesnt know a thing about how to teach. Lies what he says is on a test is not. It not helpful in any way when it comes to asking questions in regards to labs/ essay or even on the subject as a whole. He just makes it more confusing.
2,Prof McCarthy is a nice guy  but very scatterbrained and disorganized. He is interested in his field and I'm sure quite knowledgeable  but often goes off on tangents and doesn't tie it all together. Could have skipped several classes and still got the same info. Overall decent though
1,I took several of his classes and I wish I had found this site sooner!I found him to be extremely scatterbrained. There were several times I had to go talk to him about an essay topic and he kept changing my topic and adding things until even I was confused. He would then get upset with me for the changes he made! He blames students for his faults.
1,Horrible prof  horrible person.
2,Dishonourable treatment of students. There should be punitive measures for his behaviour.
1,Decent enough for undergrad courses but an absolute nightmare for graduate work. Will constantly blame you for stuff he demanded in his revisions. Very unorganized  doesn't have much knowledge on the graduate thesis process. I have sincerely regretted choosing him as my advisor. He will try to keep you there as long as possible for funding.
5,The best earth science teacher at Brock! He really challenges you to think. A lot of readings in his courses but you come out having learned a great deal.
4,VERY monotone however as others have said he is incredibly helpful and labs are really easy marks!
3.5,Although he is monotone and tends to speak in questions  his labs are free marks and if you pay attention to his lectures and his exam hints you'll to fine. VERY helpful if you don't understand something.
4,i knew him when he was still in GEOGRAPHY. back then his labs were the booster for my GPA. rock on.
4.5,Great prof! He's always available to answer questions and responds to e-mails usually in the same day  even on Sunday's! His exams and labs are a little tough because he expects us to remember more than he teaches us.
1,boring  couldn't be more monotone  SO NOT FUNNY
1,Spaced out guy.
1,No Comments
5,Great prof! Very down to earth and reasonable. One of the best profs in the department.
5,Irvine made the course much more enjoyable than the topic alone. Content was fairly interesting but not riveting. Most fair and clear exams and grading criteria I've experienced so far. Incredibly helpful and approachable in office hours. You need to study to do well  but you 100% get the grade you earn  which I love. Irvine is fantastic!
5,be sure to see him in his office hours if you want to do well  fortunately he seemed to have more office hours then the rest of my professors combined  papers take about 3 hours to write and about the same amount of time to edit
3,2 essays  midterm and final. Nice guy and goes over material well  but marks papers and midterm based more on grammar and writing style than actual content. Very high expectations for a first year class.
5,Probably the nicest  kindest professor out there! SImply a genuine guy. Extremely helpful and approachable for advice  decisions or help in the course. His lectures are great to attend  they are all you need to succeed. Highly recommend him as a professor  he really promotes discussions and debate. Great teacher and got me interested in philosophy
5,Such a kind  caring  through professor. Attend lectures  those are all the notes you need to do well. Encourages discussion  individual thought and expression  and is hands down the cutest prof ever!
5,An awesome prof  super clear
5,He's a casual and helpful professor. My complaint is that he stuck too closely to the readings in lecture
2,He does seem nice  but I don't think Phil 120 is a GPA booster. (Perhaps  I am not suitable for this kind of topic/stuff). The materials were dry and boring...However  if you like logic  you might want to take it  but in my opinion I wouldn't recommend!
5,Dr. Irvine is honestly one of the kindest people I've ever met. His lectures are very interesting and easy to understand. Tests are really fair.
5,This guy was made to teach. I still find the subject material boring so his lectures aren't always special  but he's always crystal clear. Great format and consistency between text book questions  lectures  and tests. Highly recommended.
5,Irvine's the man!
4,awesome prof. Irvine is a very nice  caring  and passionate prof. He is very interesting to listen to. if you ever go to his office hours  he's such a nice guy. He is very patient and makes sure you leave his room happy and confident in the material. Highly recommend taking this course for GPA boosters and having him as a prof.
5,You don't need to attend his lectures  but if you have time  you should check it out  but if you don't  read from the book and you should be fine. The subject was easy and the quizzes were fair  the average for our class was 75 so if you're planning on getting some ez credits  I'd definitely recommend him.
5,Very good at getting his message across in class. Manages to make a relatively boring topic semi-interesting. You really don't need to go to class  though. Everything is in the textbook. Going to class does help to clarify.
4.5,an easy a!
4.5,An intellectual and effective teacher. He is very clear in his teaching and he can provide concrete examples while he is at it. Very approachable too. The reading list for this class is massive though. Still  he is a fair marker  when it wasn't the TA who was marking.
4.5,An excellent prof. Can take complex concepts and teach them with clarity  insight and without the academic technobabble or high-browed  esoteric philosophizing. Good sense of humor  answers questions thoughtfully  knows his stuff and is straightforward. Inspires interest in the subject. Highly recommend!
5,He is a brilliant teacher. Makes the class really interesting. The tests seemed easy because he tried really hard to make sure everyone was prepared and fully understood the material.
5,brilliant prof  always explained everything SO well  entertaining  interactive  thoughtfully answered questions  reading wasnt't too brutal  midterm was fairly easy  great class
5,Course itself is pretty difficult but Mike's lectures are the best thing to listen to. He is loud and speaks his mind during class so as long as you can get pass that he's a amazing instructor to have.
5,He can be aggressive and loud in his lectures  but he just wants to get his point across. He is absolutely flawless at explaining things  and is very funny and friendly. I would recommend taking his class for sure  It's absolutely worth it!
3,"Not my teaching style. Tends to be aggressive and loud  using phrases in lectures like ""I don't know how anyone can't know this""  ""If you don't know this by now  I don't know what to do"". Didn't seem fully prepared for later course material. High energy and enthusiastic. Friendly. Often jokes around."
5,Mike is a great teacher to have for intro to programming. I had zero programming experience going into the class  but his teaching made it easier for me. When he is explaining topics and theory he really makes sure what he is saying is clear. The class is known for being hard  which is why easiness is 3  but if you go to class and work you'll do ok
4,I had no previous programming knowledge before this class and I walked with a B. His lectures are funny and interesting. He dumbs it down so you can understand the concepts. GO TO THE SL SESSIONS! It's free tutoring and anything free is good. They help clarify the lectures and are hands on. Mike wants you to pass so you have support there.
2.5,Mike does not care about his students  the only way you will do good in this class is if you work your ass off or have previous coding experience. This class is VERY stressful and you have to put in like 6 hours a week just on homework if you don't understand. They do offer sl (student learning sessions) but they aren't all that helpful
4.5,Good class  as long as you show up and pay attention you'll pass. If you're struggling just attend SL sessions and its almost impossible to fail.
5,BEST
3.5,Very funny personality  talks like he doesn't care but as he get's more excited he sounds more angry  which makes learning programming really funny. If you are new to programming take his class! If you already know how to program TAKE HIS CLASS because if you finish the assignments you get guaranteed 80%  rest is the tests.
5,Great instructor! Can be intimidating at first  but he just gets really excited about programming. Really helpful for new programmer at explaining concepts in plain english.
5,Mike is a total Boss. Best instructor I've had at NAIT.
5,Amazing programming instructor  able to relate programming concepts in a way that is easy for newer programmers to understand. Overall a very friendly guy. He should quit smoking though!
3.5,I am a garbage programmer but this guy is a very good instructor if you have the ability to learn programming. Easy going  helpful  will do half the code for you if you are struggling. Probably the best introductory programming instructor you could get. Show some effort and he will always help you.
5,AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING Definately one of the best teachers I have ever had. Great guy!
5,"Awesome Professor. Lots of energy  teaches with repetition  but in a good way. (song) ""Roll up your totals!"" and other lame but cute things work BEAUTIFULly as mnemonic devices. Really cares about student success  as long as the student cares themself."
5,This guy is soooo funny! Always making us laugh! He's very helpful when you need his help  too. If I had one word to describe him.... Quirky
4,First day I was in class with Mike he had sooo much energy
5,One of the best teachers I've come across in CST so far. Mike gives superb in-class examples that are relevant to the lab assignments. He'll take time to help out students  including running over code from several students in his office over his breaks.
5,One of the best instructors I've had. Very helpful in all areas. Will do anything he can to help a student understand and pass the courses he teaches
5,Promoting Student Success? Yes.
2.5,Not very clear  always had something bad to say about accountants and lawyers  never had an assignment graded by her as she leftwas removed halfway through the semester.
1,Condescending  rude  talks over students when she asks questions  unclear  confusing  chaotic - it's like watching a one person tennis match who is playing both sides.
4,Very easy to follow and sets assignment dates at a reasonable pace. A little bit too much hand-holding although based on some other reviews I can see why she might...
1.5,Horrible instructor. Picks favourites  vague instructions and at times unrealistic deadlines. When roughly 50% of the class is failing (keep in mind we started with 20 some people and fell to 10) you're doing something wrong. Please go away forever.
2,She needs to leave this department!!! She has such a low level interest with all students. She makes references to classes she does not communicate with the other professor. Her basic skill knowledge of computers is limited. Cant stand her as a teacher !!
2,"Completely agree with one of the previous ratings : ""She acts like she is friendly but she is actually not. She choose people to be nice to."""
4.5,She was really helpful over email. Most instructors are horrible at that  so props to her for that!
1,I just dont like her. She acts like she is friendly but she is actually not. She choose people to be nice to.
5,She was very helpful and lenient when my group was getting our project done.
2.5,She spent far too much time writing code on the board. Julie Lutter uses that same technique. It is to far out of date to be used at NAIT. Never really knew what I was supposed to do. Was lost by the time lab1 was out even though I got +90% on quiz 1.
1.5,her classes were AGONIZING. Almost never did her code work. And she'd spend the rest of class helping one student try to get HER code fixed. Aweful!
2,Due to illness/family issues I was only able to show up to class once a week (for our exams every Friday) and yet I managed to pass with a 80%. Class was not difficult  but it was a hassle to receive our grades and marks. And even now that the semester is over  I still do not have a final mark/grade.
5,Shane's a hilarious teacher  he always wanted to take the time to help out students do the best they could. If you try in this class its an easy A.
5,Shane is a great teacher! He always makes sure everyone understands and is totally willing to help with problems  even if it means looking into it after hours for a student. His lessons are clear and leave you prepared to complete the labs and in class assessments.
3,Great instructor. Sadly not enough variety on exercises. Lab and Quiz questions half the time are not near what you were taught. Lectures are great and he is available to answer any questions. But  his grading system is way too strict and he will deduct marks for the most minor error that has no effect on the code itself. Expect 15-20% less mark.
5,Shane Bell was surprisingly cool. He cared about the class and his students  and he always wanted everyone to succeed. His classes were fun and engaging  and he did a lot of in-class activities that got everybody involved with the course material. If there was ever a problem  Shane was always willing to help in any way he could. Very awesome.
5,Shane is a stand up guy. If you show up to class and engage you won't fail. He always gives class time for labs and allows a cheat sheet for tests. Put in some effort and you should have no problem getting a good mark.
3.5,Shane is hilarious and really good at explaining concepts. You need to practice your code and show up to every lecture. His tests were really challenging compared to the labs. He's more than willing to help you if you need it. There are SL sessions you can attend with a student tutor WHICH ARE FREE! Will supply duo-tangs for labs :) Thanks Shane!
5,Shane! This guy is the best! He's one of the funniest teachers I've had. This class is known for a high fail rate  but Shane is very helpful and wants you to pass. If you do not show up to class or do the exercises  you might fail  the content is not super easy  but manageable if you put in the effort. Hell of a guy  tough course. Go to class kids.
4.5,He is an incredible instructor for Database Fundamentals - funny  gives good analogies  and is extremely quick-witted. You could ask him anything related to databases and he would give you a well-thought out answer on the spot. Whenever a student had a question  he didn't mind taking the time to explain things over. Would highly recommend.
5,DMIT-1508 has a very high fail rate. Shane makes this class awesome and fun. As long as you show up and PAY ATTENTION  you can do very well. I suspect the high fail rate is due to people browsing their Facebook or text messages in class. You're paying for the course  don't waste your chances.
2,This class overall has an incredibly high fail rate. This teacher  however  doesn't make it any easier. His lectures are confusing  and doesn't give any chances for a retake or even to earn lost marks. If you fail one quiz or one lab  just drop the course and don't waste your time
1,Seems totally disorganized. Not helpful in any way. Doesn't really know what he's talking about. I was totally dissatisfied. Do NOT reccommend.
2.5,He started out motivated and interesting but after mid-terms barely taught at all  leaving the majority of time for lab time (uh: in-class WOW  IM and facebook anyone?) and general skipping. His notes are a dump of information which he mined for obscure things not taught/glossed over in class for mid-term and finals.
4.5,He was a good guy! I liked his structured approach to the course and got the stuff done! He was helpful  and liked to help you if you really needed it  which was greatly appreciated.
3,at the beginning of the course  he was a super nice guy  funny. Then something rotten must have happened in his personal life  cos half way through he became a miserable old coot.
4,After reading the comments  I'd say he's getting better at teaching. Probably only his 3rd or 4th year teaching. He's a good teacher  but I wouldn't miss a single class cause he'll ignore you if you skip.
5,No Comments
2.5,Typical instructor. Didn't really do anything to stand out. Being able to right quiz 1 (IST 210) on the computers made it alot easier to get 100%.
2.5,Spent most of class scratching his head  erasing and re-writing his code  and trying to remember syntax. His classes were a waste of time. He never prepared or updated himself.
1,Incredibly rude and unprofessional. Likes to demean students and embarrass them in front of the class.
5,Dwayne was a funny teacher that was very helpful in bringing realism and humor to the project management course. Be warned overly sensitive students may not enjoy him. He was available to give you constructive criticism on your assignments  and related any issues he found with them to real life examples.
5,He is one of the amazing teachers at NAIT. He has a great level of Sarcasm. His teaching method is different which make everything so easy to understand. He relates things to daily life and gives different example which makes it so easy to understand.
5,Honestly i thought Dwayne Rurka was the best professor i have even encountered at N.A.I.T.. The lectures were interesting  he made sure the students were included in the arguments and he kept us on out toes. i really took in what he taught from his classes and have new respect for other perspectives. So i want to say thank you.
4,Sure he might be a bit rough  but he explains the ins and outs of design. From Sequence Diagrams  Use Cases to Screen Designs. He's able to point the flaws and mistakes when you submit a document.
1,truthfully I took classes in DMIT expecting to receive a scholarly perspective  I dont think he even has a degree
1,He was nothing but a bully  disguised as a teacher. Yelling and taunting kids were his main teaching methods. If you can switch out of his class.
4,A big heart under his rough exterior  made what should have been a boring class entertaining and worthwhile. He does like to pick on students but it is all in good fun and he rewards students that pout in effort. Don't let his gruff hunter persona fool you either  he is one of the most intelligent people in the faculty.
4,From what should be the most boring class (SAD)  doing flow charts and drawings Dwayne actually manages to keep things interesting. He likes to joke around and pick on people but it's all in good fun. Although he can be tough on you in class at times his class is definitely my favorite.
1.5,Dwayne can be a total jerk and I found him to be unreliable and disinterested in actually helping students. He tries to be intimidating but it's just laughable -- his giant ego doesn't live up to his imagined greatness.
4.5,Dwayne is an awesome Project Instructor. He takes care of the the project team in order to ensure that both the client and the team's needs are met without being intrusive. He allows PMs to take the lead in managing the project but is always available for support. You should be so lucky to attend his class.
4.5,Like the previous person said  U never know what mood Dwayne maybe in... but he was still a very well knowledgable prof.
3,He has a unique attitude. You never know how he'll react to a situation. But more often than not  it won't be to your liking.
4,Excellent teacher and a fine human being. Highly reccomended.
4,Totally NUTS  but an amazing teacher. Had him for 3 classes and want to take another with him!!
5,Such an amazing teacher. If I could take that class again  I would in a heart beat!
1,This guy is odd  kinda mean sometimes when you don't see things HIS way. Don't like how he interacts with female students. Weird. Acts nice  like your good buddy  and then can zap you out of nowhere. Material is interesting but he can be off the wall. Be careful of him is my best advice.
2.5,I thought taking a 3 hour long class would be difficult to get through each week  but Salloway is so interesting and intriguing and always looking to make jokes. He is very smart in general and has a deep passion for what he teaches. But  he is very judgmental of his students and a strange grader with unclear parameters.
3.5,"This man loves what he does  sometimes a little too much. Class lectures include personal stories  which are sometimes refreshing  but most of the time have nothing to do with the class topic. On the exam he actually wrote ""you will not know all of the answers on this exam"". Then why ask the questions???"
3,Funny guy  picks favorites  wierd grading style and lecturer...
4,His teaching style is the best I've seen in a while. He is engaging  and forces his students to think for themselves and actually learn the material.
3,Salloway is a great story teller and I did very well in his class. If you do very well he will try and push you into the major. He will be persistant  too persistant. Anyways  hopefully you have KVD as your lab instructor because she is hot and put out to me during the semester. She's fun.
4,excellent teacher  makes Epidemiology a really fun class
5,Best Teacher I Had In All 4 Years
4.5,Hes a good guy... grading isnt entirely based on your tests/quizzes/etc - he really encourages classroom interaction so take advantage of participation points. I also took 501 with him and it was very interesting but kinda gross!
4,wicked nice guy! his grading was pretty lenient and shows he cares about his students by taking time after class to talk with students and their concerns. however  keep up with the reading because if you fall behind  youre screwed.
4,Took this class as a gen ed and found it facinating. Salloway is an entertaining lecturer and a very interesting guy but he does dedmand hard work.
2,he used to be such a great guy. i looked forward to class with him. but lately he's just grouchy and mean and sometimes hurtful. no need to crush unsuspecting former students emotions...he'll be your best friend until you do something he thinks is beneath you...then he'll make you feel like a loser
4,Salloway really wants everyone to LEARN the material. very scatterbrained in terms of teaching style and thus sometimes hard to follow  but a wonderfully jolly and kind man (he looks like santa). He really knows his stuff and tries to make class worthwhile for students. His tests aren't easy  but he grades fairly and scales. A really great class!
1,Dr. Salloway needs to retire ASAP. He may have been great in the past  but he's starting to slip. He is always angry  which seems to influence his grading/approachability. He needs to take care of his issues BEFORE he comes in to class. He tries to be funny  and gets a few nervous chuckles  but otherwise is NOT well liked  at least this semester.
1,What a harda** - I made an appointment to go in and discuss a paper topic  and he blew me off.r When I called him  I had to leave 3 voicemail messages because he's never around. A total technophobe  he's inaccessible.r He also blamed the missed appointment on me  saying he had written down the next week tho' I programmed it into my phone's calenda
4,Totally awesome  everyone's right about his lectures  they get off topic easily...so you have to take whatever you want from his teachings
5,Best professor I have had at UNH. Interesting  entertaining  and always willing to help.
5,Words can't explain her greatness. My classmates and I all agreed that this was one of the best courses at York. Dr. Geller is extremely respectful  helpful and professional. She's not the kind of professor who enjoys torturing you. You will have no problem doing the papers and presentations as long as you do your work. I really enjoyed the class.
3.5,she is totally awesome!! she might not have the time to meet up  so if you're a student who likes to meet up with her after class to dicuss things  she probably wouldn't appeal to you. What I loved about Prof Geller is that she provided a hand's on approach to learning. Very knowledgleable  fair  engaging...i always looked forward to her class!
4,Great prof!!! She is a great lecturer  involves the class and has lots of interesting movies. The tests are easy if you do the reading. They're directly out of the text book for the multiple choice  and lecture notes for short answer. Her lecture notes are available in the library. Very good prof!!!
4,A great teacher! One of the best I have ever had. She's very clear  has great examples and attemps to make the class involved in the lectures.
2,She is very knowledgable in what she does  i give her that. She may be an amazing therapist  but as an instuctor she is quite bad. Not flexible (even re meeting)  unclear about assignments  lectures too fast with too much stuff on overhead. She teaches only part-time  she's mainly a therapist.
5,Dr Geller was so organized! All mc questions were from text and short answers from lectures. YOu know what to expect and can study accordingly. Know your stuff and you'll do well! I got an A in her class. I actually looked forward to attending.
4,good prof
3.5,She's a really smart prof and willing to help out. But the notes she provides are worse than bad  and there's not much to add during lectures. The readings were interesting but it was hard to apply them to the paper and final. I wish she relied more on her own teaching than on outside literature. Leaves much to be desired.
5,Great prof. Very personable teaching style and a knack for breaking down complex ideas. Expectations were clear and she was very approachable for clarifications. Also great at answering questions.
3.5,she's a good professor. very engaging & her teaching style helps keep students interested. the course could have been organized better.
4.5,Enthusiastic  intelligent  and interesting! Professor O'Mahony teaches very well and is a good marker. She is always willing to help and she is well-read in her field. Recommended!
5,Awesome prof!:-) She is very enthusiastic about the topic  extremely knowledgeable  and her class made me much more interested in the subject. She makes a real effort to make assignments interesting and non-repetitive. She is also super approachable and willing to help students out. I highly recommend taking a seminar course from her.
5,well organized course  good lecturer  shows interest in topic  easy papers
5,She'll make you work  but she marks fair and communicates clearly in her lectures. You won't do well if you slack off  but if you are interested in the topic  you'll definitely learn.
3.5,Take econ before you take this class  but it's really not that hard even if you didn't. She's great as a person  very fun. DO THE READINGS. It's a bit much  the SPERO+HART is useless. Wild swing in marking.
2,its a good thing she's helpful outside of class  because i guarantee you'll be going to her office hours for help after you've sat through her dry and discombobulated lectures
4.5,She's very fun  but talks too fast. She's more organized this term. The Econ is the course is okay. Marks things really fast  returns you the essays the next class! A fair marker.
4,Very nice person and she is very helpful and approachable as well as being very knowledgable about the class. However I think she marks a little on the hard side and her lectures are sometimes disorganized.DO NOT take this class unless you have taken ECON
4,fair but challenging marker. not an easy course  but she is very knowledgeable and helpful when you need it. difficult to take notes off  however. needs a powerpoint presentation or something
1.5,Please don't take this unless you really have to. She goes way too fast to understand new concepts and assumes you know a lot of economic shortcuts. Very unorganized lectures.
3,laid back  easy-going  and she definitley knows her stuff ... just wish she knew how to teach and give lectures
2,Although she is very nice and approachable  she mumbles  not talks  VERY fast  and gets off topic easily ... no overhead notes or powerpoint presentations  which make lectures unclear and difficult to follow/understand
3.5,The only thing difficult with his classes is the volume of information needed to have an understanding of. Doug is eager to help any student though  if confused at all ask for help
1.5,He tells the same stories over and over again. he reads right from the textbook and points at the board with a lazer pointer. He can barely walk and makes his tests hard  he expects 70% to fail.... Worst prof ever
3,Tests and bell ringers are VERY HARD. You really need to study. His lectures are interesting to say the least. His sex lecture if by far the best/funniest lecture I've ever been to in my 3 years at BU!
4,Doug Macintyre is Brilliant. He is extremely intelligent and very helpful - you just have to know that if you need assistance  you have to ask and he will do whatever he can to help. Go to class. Although it is mostly straight from the text  his little random pieces of info are interesting and helpful for remembering other processes.
4,Definetly knows his stuff. Go to class even though the same info is in the text. Midterms and Final are hard! Study your butt off!!!! Many people take the class many times. Will help you if you need help. He makes the class interesting with his little stories
2.5,Get a second opinion if you see him for course advice. I know lots of students who had to come back for another year because he told them the wrong stuff. Good at teaching A & P  though!
4,great guy  expects a lot but works hard himself... knows his stuff well. I recommend.
5,Doug is a great prof - go to the lectures to hear his `tidbits` that will never appear in any textbook!

2,Read the textbood and don't bother going to class
4.5,No Comments
4.5,Very nice  lectures well.
3.5,Too smart to teach A+P altough he is a very nice guy.
3,Andrzej's lectures aren't well structured so there's a lot of self learning in this course. Exam questions come from assignments  the textbook  and a test bank. His use of MCQs can be good and bad  good because you can guess  bad because you don't get part marks. It's difficult to do well in this course but it's also difficult to fail.
3,His exams are fair- half multiple choice and half long answer  and he gives partial credit even if you mess up. I didn't do a whole lot of work and I still almost got a B-  so try and it's an easy course.
3,Ok prof- he likes to talk about concepts instead of solving lots of problems in class  which helps with understanding but all the tests are only on the questions. You have to attend DGDs for that. But all past tests can be found online with answers and he seems to reuse the same questions every year so its not too hard to do well on his exams.
4,"Overall a good professor. With all the bonus marks and ""gift"" marks  he makes it pretty hard to fail his class. He does extra review sessions before midterms and the final exam and it's really useful to attend them. He's a great lecturer but be prepared to do a great amount of work in his class or you won't get a good grade."
3,Probably the funniest prof I had last semester. He is a fair guy and gives you lots of opportunities to do well in the course. He tosses free bonus marks. Go to dgd's there are quizzes that can result in bonus marks. For 1321 (or 1331) he provides you with all of his course notes which has everything you need for the course. FInd old exams!!!!!!!!!
5,Very fair at marking and is really really funny! His classes were the highlight of my semester  can't wait for PHY 1322!
4,How can you hate him? Lots of extra bonus points and he recycles his questions. He really tries his best to keep the class entertained. I believe he wants the best for his students but his teaching technique isnt really the best. Make sure you try to understand the content before class and his teaching supplements whatever youve got. Go for DGDs
5,Hilarious guy. However  I found I was doing lots of self-learning. He is not the best at explaining concepts  and some parts felt a little rushed like rotational dynamics. However  he is so generous with marks. He gives tons of extra credit and the questions he asks on assignments and tests are very fair. If you did well in grade 12 physics ur good
5,Prof Czajkowski is the only prof for this course and is the best. He can be intimidating  but he is hilarious. His marking is really fair such that you will not be able to fail his class unless you put in no work. The final was multiple choice which was good. Midterms were quite hard but he gives many opportunities to bring your mark up.
3,He gets angry at students from time to time  and I can't remember ever being on schedule in his class. He skips over some content in class (sometimes would ask TAs to make up for it in DGDs). The assignments are hard  but if you can do them you're good for the midterms. Exam was more challenging in addition to being entirely multiple choice.
4,Great prof! While the content is hard  he is a funny lecturer and makes it really difficult to fail! Wouldn't take the class as an elective but Czajkowski makes it easy to enjoy. Hilarious emails too!
3,Sends the most hilarious emails  if you don't get his sarcasm you will hate him  accent is thick but still easy to understand. Attending the lectures is a must  content isn't posted online. Doing an assignment every week is annoying but easily brings up your grade. Midterms and exams were fair to what we saw in class  posts old tests and breakdown.
3,Not the best teacher. He goes over a lot of the assignments in class and makes it VERY difficult to fail. I failed a midterm and the final and still managed to pass with over a 60. Also  DO THE EXTRA CREDIT  It can take pretty close to 10% off the final exam. Very difficult class if you didn't take high school physics. GO TO CLASS  it's worth it
5,Reviewers say Czajkowski is rude  but that's because no one understand sarcasm these days. I found him to be very nice/genuine outside of lectures (office hours)  where you can talk to him 1 on 1. Many complain about how heavy the course is  but assignments are optional (bonus points). 1331 kids are also salty since they didn't take HS physics.
5,There are assignments every week  which although is a lot  only 240 of 310 possible points actually counts which leaves out 2-3 assignments. You only lose BONUS marks from him if you ask questions from a lecture 2 weeks ago. There are many practice quizzes at the DGDs to help you. He's a great prof and wants to help  but it's a difficult course.
2,He has a huge ego  he likes to single out students in class and embarrass them for answering questions wrong and thinks he is a lot better of a teacher than he actually is. He also takes away marks if you ever email him or go to his office hours
1,This class will take over your life. The prof is extremely egotistical and thinks he is the best thing since sliced bread - he isn't. No written feedback until the midterms/exams. If this course is a requirement for you  I'd recommend trying to get another prof. Or get well acquainted with Khan Academy and be prepared to self teach!
2,Just a Jerk. He expects you to pick up the material immediately  and is shocked if you don't get it like he does. Says some funny things in class but that's about it. Otherwise he's a hard professor not looking to help you.
2,He is rude. When you talk to him  he turns your back towards you and starts talking to somebody else. On the final exam  he changed the order of the questions but forgot to change the order of the answers. In addition  the scanner missed some answers. We were shocked when we received the results but he would not believe us that something went wrong
5,Favourite first year prof  genuinely cares about students. With pre-lecture quizzes  assignments  etc.  he gives you more than enough of a chance to bump up your grade. His midterms/exams are very reasonable. DO THE ASSIGNMENTS and GO TO CLASS: oftentimes midterm questions will be taken straight from assignments and in-class questions.
3,Osland is a very nice man. His intro marketing class  however  is tough. The lectures are fun  but his grades are not posted on Moodle. Also  he grades very subjectively by always requiring essays on exams vs. multiple choice. Study very hard for this class.
1,Very dull course. Tests are difficult  and the class is a bore to sit through. Am not a fan of him or his teaching methods.
2,Attempting to stay conscious in this class takes skills beyond the average human. One of the most boring professors  I've ever had. Lectures the ENTIRE class period and takes no effort to engage his students. Especially in a subject like marketing  this is pure torture. Takes random points off on exams and bores you to death. DO NOT TAKE.
4,Dr. Osland is a fantastic guy and an intelligent professor. Nice as could be and I really enjoyed his lectures (most of them were interactive with the class so that helped to keep things interesting)  but he was somewhat weird when it came to grading.. basically on all assignments and tests he took off a couple points and I wasn't totally sure why.
3.5,Hard grader on tests and doesn't really give reasons for grades most of the time (especially on tests.) Other than that he is a solid teacher and would recommend him if you are trying to play it safe.
2.5,Lectures were fairly interesting  but the were no where near captivating. Dr. Osland was intelligent  but his arrogance made class a chore. Also don't tell him if you speak Spanish
4.5,He really engages his students  and I absolutely loved his GHS - I wasn't expecting to enjoy it  but he did an awesome job!
5,Great professor! He explains everything clearly and provides study guides for the tests. He grades fairly and plans his assignments so students can keep up with the workload. I hope I will have the opportunity to be in one of his MBA classes.
3,He never gives real homework assignments. Your grades are based solely on a few papers and the tests you write. He is very vague about what is going to be on the test  and reviewing just confused me more. Nice guy but needs to clarify what we exactly need to know succeed in the class.
5,He is excellent! He knows his stuff  makes it interesting  shows ads and example throughout the semester to make it interactive. All-in-all he is great professor and I hope I get to take him again.
5,No Comments
5,VERY well prepared for class. Makes class interactive
5,Try to take him for marketing classes if you can. He knows his stuff and will work to make sure you understand everything. Can be a tough grader on assignments  esp. papers.
1,College geometry is a self taught course. She literally doesn't teach anything. If you don't know what proofs are or have a good sense of geometry  this class is NOT FOR YOU! She doesn't teach  she expects you to already know everything and if you don't know she won't help you.
1,She is terrible. Just the worst teacher ever. I have had a few mediocre teachers in my life but I have never actually had a BAD teacher and she was just awful. She does not know the material she was teaching and one of the students basically taught our class because Dr. V got so much wrong. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS!!!
5,Great  caring teacher! Always willing to help and actually wants you to learn the material. If people don't like her  its because they don't want to actually work for a grade (its college... you are going to have to actually try .)
4,"She's nice enough  goes over a lot examples  a LOT of times. there's entire class days devoted just for practice before tests. The only thing I hate is that she USES WILEY A lot and those darn quizzes sneakup on you.Take em early! I hate teachers that are lazy/depend on websites to ""keep track"" /grade quizzes AS sometimes the website WAS WRONG!"
1,She doesen't really know what she is talking about. She can't always explain questions from students in class -and when she does some are incorrect! Relies to heavily on CourseCompas.com to do her work... all she does is grade your blue books! If you have no problem teaching yourself  you'll be just fine. She really uses website as crutch!!BAD!
1.5,WARNING. If you want to keep taking this course over and over again...take her...she is Str8 horrible.
1,Horrible
4,I enjoyed her group assignments. We learned a lot in group. Her tests are very reasonable.
5,Political Theory was reading heavy but the tests were directly from the reading. One paper. Brings up interesting topics for class discussion
5,Professor Rooney never missed one class meeting throughout the semester. You must get the book for class. The semester in all was 2 quizzes  midterm and a final and extra credit was available. No homework. Everything for the tests are in his lecture don't miss his class if you want an A. I missed 4-5 classes and was able to get a B. Good class!
5,Good professor  just read the textbook and you should be fine.
4,Knows what he's talking about. Everything is explained on the syllabus. You have to read the instructions and follow them. If you don't follow instructions  you lose points -- no duh. Not confusing if you know how to read. If you ask questions via email  he responds.
1,He is a VERY tough grader. He docks points for almost anything. All his tests are completely fill in and are very confusing. He is biased towards his book  being that he is the co-author & doesn't try to explain concepts in a different way even when students don't understand. He does not show interest or concern about his students. DO NOT TAKE HIM
3,Where do I begin. First off  Professor Rooney is a VERY knowledgeable person. However  I believe that this was the hardest class I have ever taken. I expected to be able to get by from doing all the homework  reading  and attending every class session  but for some reason I could not succeed the way I wanted or expected to. Good Luck!
5,Professor Rooney was great. He is very funny guy but sometimes thinks he's a little funnier than he really is. As for the class it's pretty simple. The only homework is read and it's a must to pass the class. Unless you can listen and learn. Also there are practice tests online that he pulls questions from  so do those too!!
5,Challenging class but smart and funny teacher. You must READ the book and take careful notes on how to do the exercises on the quizzes and tests. If you memorize the definitions and follow the examples  it's not that hard.
2.5,Pretty funny which makes even 3 hour lectures feel short. Although  he is probably more skilled on how to make his students feel stupid rather than the actual subject of Philosophy. I started out the class with about 30 classmates and half way through only 8 of us were left. You have to work extremely hard to even receive a B. Would NOT recommend.
4,The class was 3 hours long but his lectures made it feel so much shorter. He's clearly passionate and extremely knowledgeable about the subject. He has high expectations of his students so be ready to make an effort if you want to pass. As for those of us who survived to the end of the semester  we loved him.
4,Do ALL the work. To get an A it is ESSENTIAL you understand the material. It is not simply knowledge based  but application. This class is basically using COMMON SENSE/LOGIC to see if an argument is bad or good. It will be HARD if you don't understand the material. if you actually pay attention and understand it  it is EASY. Extra Credit Possible.
4,I really liked him! He is intelligent  funny  and clear. If you're taking him for Logic in Practice  YOU NEED THE BOOK! You won't pass without it - the class is entirely based it. He conducts lectures through student participation. He is a bit of a tough grader  but you shouldn't have a hard time as long as you pay attention and know the material.
5,Mr. Rooney is a excellent professor  his lectures are long  but crystal clear with the use of humor and enthusiasm which makes the class interesting. His class is composed of written work only  and he is a tough grader. You REALLY need to take notes  study the book  and avoid skipping class in order to pass the class.
4,I am taking the final for this class tomorrow but overall a good class. The lectures are long but it really clarifies the concepts. At first he was very repetitive but with more material it was very helpful. His examples are funny  and if you don't think he's funny at all then you probably have boring classmates. You have to work but it's worth it.
1,Lecture are incredibly long and boring
4.5,He is one of the best teachers I had in this community college. Although he is hard  he is the fairest grader I have ever met. If you want to learn how to think critically you should take this class. He is very serious and isn't afraid to tackle very critical logical misconceptions. But if you want an easy A this isn't the class for you.
4,Here's a new concept students should try: Studying. In order to pass his class  one must actually study  he teaches the material and it is up to the student to try to understand it  you actually have to use logic in his class not just learn definitions. Although he doesn't check the homework  it is the difference between passing and failing
4.5,Amazing teacher. Intelligent & understands what hes talking about. Hard but well worth it. He teaches logic not writing logic. Very funny & loves his work. He only uses one small $20 textbook. Expect to use it a lot. My advice
2.5,It felt like a high school class going through the motions  but I didn't really learn because it was so basic. Mostly practice problems that didn't count for a grade. Class was not stimulating  but rather boring.Also he thinks he's funny  which can get annoying. Don't buy the book because he requires online text. Take the class only if you have to.
5,This professor is great.He will teach you a lot about the subject. He is a hard grader  so pay attention and do the HW. he doesn't grade it  but its help-full. his assignments are short and his test are hard. take home quizzes too.
4,sharing articles that we read during the week is a very good idea.
3,It's a weeding out class for pre-allied health students. He's very successful at losing students too. When those who are left after 2 months and the average on his exam is 60% something is wrong. Not very interesting lectures  lab is fine. It's all memorization and identify tissue - we don't put to use anything learned. I wouldn't recommend.
4,Works hard to help students
5,he's great. very clear  very helpfull and fair. he knows his stuff very well. he's great! just great! merci :)
5,He is very helpful and nice. He is clear + fair
1,Avoid this teacher if possible. Does not test fairly at all. Makes mistakes frequently and is not equipped to teach at this level.
2.5,Nice teacher  respectful to students and willing to offer help  but is unclear on his expectations for assignments. Never knew if I was doing what he wanted  usually a hit or miss situation
5,best professor in the world....
2.5,long forogt about what the environment really is
2,WAS interested before taking the course  assignements were a joke  & he butchered the course material--what a waste of $.
4,This is the second course I with him. I got an 82 on the first course. Not saying its easy  lots of reading  and for assignments you have to use basically everything you know. He is boring at time  but its the materials fault. He'll get you through it! An over all good proff!
3.5,he always acts as a gentleman  very polite  very clear speaking  and really helpful to my studying.
5,Great teacher  great lectures  great material.
3.5,he is quite****but an overall nice guy :D I enjoyed what I learned even though it was not my major. I got an A on both havles and it was not a very difficult course compared to other sciences. Love the magic pointer wand!
5,always there to help!
4.5,awesome prof.!!
3,Boring class... I liked OAC environment better
1.5,Wasn't crazy about her teaching style. She used handwritten overheads the whole quarter which included abbreviations that no one understood.
3,she's such an easy teacher. all her tests & quizzes are based off the notes in class. she has some pretty ridiculous things to say  though. like if you eat a candy bar you should skip a meal. get a good seat in class because her big hair blocks the overhead.
2,Surprisingly tough class. She's very quiet  try not to sit in the back. Gives extra credit on tests  but you have to really study to get those points. Multiple choice tests on scantron with some short answer.
5,No Comments
5,tough class  lots of things to remember  but not much different from any other class. She gives you a break by giving you LOTS of x-tra credit and make-ups. Really knows her stuff.
1.5,this class was harder than i thought  basically you have to study everything in order to get a good grade  there is a lot of information and she talks while youre writing notes so by the time youre done writing you havent heard the lecture
1,Ms. Bittenbender would be far better suited teaching at a junior high school. Easiest A I've ever earned. She is very opinionated and her teachings are definitely biased.
5,One of the best professors I have ever had. If something was not understood  he stops and makes sure that everyone understands before moving on. He actually teaches instead of lectures.
5,He is tough  but fair. You cannot skip class because he does not allow any make-up for the unannounced quizzes. One of the best professors at CCSN. I recommend him  but be ready to work.
5,Great teacher

1.5,I don't like him... He makes me sleepy.
1,He is so snubby. i hate his personality
5,I wish that I could take a class from this man every semester of my school career. Papers? Too hard. Tests? Too hard. Readings? Too many. But man  did I learn a lot. Thanks Ralph.

4.5,Ralph is awesome at applying these things to your life as a believer...and he's funny and easy to talk to!!

5,Lovely! Simply best ever prof. highly recommended!
5,A very smart professor  a good lecturer. If you need help  just ask  he's very helpful and friendly if you approach him.r He honestly wants you to do well and to teach well so if you come to learn  you shouldn't have a problem.
5,This guy is one of the best professors I had. Extremely helpful both during class and afterwards. Was very understanding about my varsity commitments!
1,Arrogant! Only an associate prof. Associate dean is just a useless title to make himself feel superior. Terrible engineering administration. Anyways a REAL academic would not sit in admin positions!
1,This guy thinks he is the king of the universe (since he is just an associate dean). He is going to be a bad reputation for Carleton. I don't know a single person who likes him. try to avoid him.

3,BG I owned you!!! If you do not like this class you are not an academic  drop out now! I have never laughed so much in a class in my life  he's so funny. Oh yeah  no matter what BG says the Temple was destroyed in 70 CE... NO other historian will give a different date.
3.5,BG owns
3.5,He is very knowlegable about history! He really knows his stuff and can answer pretty much any question. He can be difficult to approach with questions at times  but he tries to be available to his students.
3,"If you get lost during the class you can resort to writing BG quotes in your margins..such as: ""I'm good at geography!"" or ""Not everyone goes around saying 'I'm an Incritite!"" or ""I am not sure of the Catholic doctrine of what happend when the food and wine is digested."" He has a puzzling dislike for pentacostals though..."
3,Don't ask questions  he will ridicule you.

3,Attention Deficit Disorder describes Brian. Can't sit still and talks a lot during exams which is very disruptive. He knows history well and could answer most questions that were asked. During exams he assigns people places to sit and seems to add tension to the situation.
1,No Comments
3,A good lecturer who tried to make things interesting  but lectures were sometimes boring (it was the material I guess). A tough grader (spelling of terms needs to be exact)  but a fair variety of types of questions on exams. Fairly approachable  and fairly caring.
4,Dr. Untereiner is passionate about what she teaches  which helps stimulate interest. Class attendance is a must  as tests come from class notes. Show her respect and she will show you the same. Cares about her students. Is reasonable about expectations and can definitely get A's in her classes. Would take again.
3,Pretty bland module  but passionate about what she teaches.
3.5,Lectures are really clear  but she is a horrible marker. She will take marks off for anything  spelling  underlining..etc. Marks dont reflect how well you know the lecture material  but how picky she decides to be when marking your test/assignment. She is very friendly in class  but not so friendly one on one.
2.5,Absolutely terrible prof. Hardest marker ever and not fair at all. Watch out for definitions. You need to put down exactly what she says in class to score marks  and if you spell something wrong  your whole definition will be wrong.
4.5,Extremely well-prepared for class. Organized lectures. High degree of enthusiasm in lecture and lab. Inspires you to be a better student.
3,Power hungry
4,is a good prof  has good notes for class  but tuff marker for tests.
5,Great lectures  fair.
3,if you're a favorite  expect a free ride  otherwise watch out.
5,Very good prof  great notes  but tests are not so easy. Very helpful at any time
5,makes you interested in Botany! Excellent Prof.
3,This professor is very knowledgeable  but has a very hard time dumbing things down. You have to be able to teach yourself a lot of stuff. This is not an easy class (a tip: seek out psych profs for help). He's always trying to make jokes  they are never seem funny  but it's amusing. It's required for psych majors so good luck! Don't give up!

4.5,Not sure how he got the negative ratings  but the Prof was the exact opposite of what was stated on here. Prof was very clear  very good  and the class was really interesting.
2.5,Knows what he's talking about  has trouble teaching it. Very unorganized. Lazy
5,Knows his stuff
1,This guy is very weird. He is like a high school kid. He got his so called Ph.D by licking his supervisor's feet(Kelvin Plette). This guy must be in the mental hospital.
1,this guy is an old trailer trash proff who thinks he's some kind of king cause he has his PHD. his exams are crap and his turtle necks don't help. he's a sessional that thinks he has some kinda pull since he is stuck on the 5th floor on his knees.
1.5,One of the worst professors at the University of Alabama. The only reason people take his class is because it is required for the GIS certificate. He cares very little about you and the class. It is a shame that he has been allowed to get this far at the University of Alabama. The class is just power points and you have to teach yourself.
2,Ridiculous professor. Tests on subject matter he doesn't teach. Very dismissive when you ask for help. Worst professor I ever had at UA. Somebody break his Iphone  please.
4.5,The best professor I have ever had
1,Knows his subject of expertise  BUT doesn't know how to teach his subject of expertise. Should be a researcher  not interacting with students since he lacks the necessary communications skills. Yes  we are all impressed with your boat. Please!
1.5,This guy is an Associate Dean. He needs to stop teaching and just go be a full time admin because he isn't a clear communicator. I got tired of him leaving class to go talk on his iPhone or how he HAD to mention that he owns a boat. We get it  you get paid a lot of money  but it's not because you're a good teacher and he isn't friendly to students.
1,Doesn't treat students with respect. Dude is on a power trip.
1,On a power trip.Maybe they run the computer labs like he does in redChina. 'Communism comes to the Capstone'.Disgrace to his profession.
1,he made interesting subject kinda boring  which is hard to do. if you try to get things clarified by him  he will make you more confused since he does contradict himself all of the time. Disappointing. You can pull off a B pretty easily. An A is attainable if you study and can get lucky on some confusing questions.
1,OMG! Hard 2 understand. He seems knowledgeable
1,One of the worst I've had and I actually like the subject matter. I can't believe they made this guy the head of the entire department when Webster left. it is disappointing that our school rewards such incompetance with a department chair.
1,Terrible professor. Useless for help. Not a straight shooter. Contradicts himself all of the time.
4.5,Great Professor. Very demanding but you get back what you put in to hig classes.
4.5,Very thorough  tries to be as clear as possible. Uses PowerPoint a lot.

5,Dr. Snider was an awesome professor. I had him for my Freshman year first semester of Chem 113. Dr. Snider has meaningful lectures and describes the material very well. In regards to asking questions  anything you don't get he will make sure you understand what he is talking about by the end of the class. His office hours are open and helpful.
4,Snider is very caring and uses humor to keep your attention. He wants to help you but you need to ask! His tests are hard but as long as you study you will do fine
5,Dr. Snider is amazing. It's true his tests are very difficult and his lectures are in depth  but he makes you want to do well in his class. Very easy to get help outside of class and makes it worth your while to go talk to him. He is also great for lab!
5,LOVED LOVED LOVED Dr. Snider. Perhaps because I love Chem Lab  but Snider is amazing to take for Lab. He's hysterical and a great professor. He is there to help you at any time and has a great personality. Also doesn't make you do all the post lab work- AWESOME. I'd take him again in a heart beat!
4,Dr. Snider is one of the best professor's I have ever taken. Yes  he is a tough grader  but he made me a better student. If you do not like online homework/quizzes  DO NOT take him. Very caring  entertaining  and helpful.
4,He is hilarious  but a tough grader. if you go to office hours he would be gladly to help. Overall just a great person to talk to.
5,Snider is not an easy grader. If you want an A in his class  you will work for it. On the other hand he is hilarious and never fails to keep your attention. SIAB for life!
4,First off  Dr. Snider is hilarious! He adds humor to the chemistry which makes it a lot more bareable. The only complaint is that he grades formal labs extremely hard - it's almost impossible to get an A. Luckily  the other assignments will boost your grade and he was always willing to answer questions inside & outside of class.
3.5,Dr. Snider is a good professor. His lectures are interesting  informative  and he's got a good  funny personality. Just don't expect an easy A. You have to put a lot of effort into the class  and the tests are very challenging for a CORE class.
5,He is an amazing teacher! SIAB for life!!!
5,SNIDER!!! best teacher i have had at kings...switched from biology to chemistry major just so i can have him as a professor again...warning: not a walk in the park but his door is always open for students that need help or just want to talk and yes his take home tests will make u cry like a little girl but and he tells you that from the start
5,very very helpful ! It was a really tough class  but he gives extra work that boosts your grade. He's very funny and keeps class interesting . I go to him for help even in my other chemistry courses I have with other teachers. Recommended prof  just dont take the class expecting an A.
5,Great teacher helps you out when ever you need it makes things fun tough grader though dont expect an A
4.5,I LOVE  LOVE  LOVE DR. SNIDER. He is so slick and neat. He is extremely helpful and makes chemistry so fun and easy to relate to. His take home tests will make you want to die  but other than that you will love your life if you take him.
4.5,The best teacher at King's College. He is always willing to help his students out and is passionate about what he teaches. I would have certainly done poorly in a chem class taught by anyone else. Dr. Snider is surely a professor I would suggest taking.
5,Hands down my favorite prof at King's! Snider is hilarious and he makes the material fun and interesting to learn. For once  I was actually looking forward to chem instead of dreading it.
5,Snider is one of the best teachers I have ever had. He's pretty funny  and he learns your name very quickly. The work is not very hard  and he gives you a lot of extra assignments to make up for less than desirable quiz/exam grades.
3.5,He's funny.You ave group work  which was fun and helpful.Some of the test questions sucked like the which is bigger problems. He rambles a little but otherwise he's a great guy
5,great teacher!!! highly recommended
4,this is one of the best teachers around i had to chem classes before him and knew nothing now after having him for just one semester i know a lot..def take dr snider..awesome guy and will help u in any way..also very funny chem humor!!!
2,This person is masterful at implying content to what he says and does. I prefer substance. Seems to have a predilection towards the avant garde  and is dismissive of many types of work he feels has been sufficiently represented historically  although his personal work looks like lo-grade 1950's Ab-Ex. Go figure.
1,Allen cannot communicate. He dominates critiques and goes on for hour unending about irrelevant information. He insults his students (he called my work crap). He is unprofessional and should not be teaching. Avoid him at all costs unless painting is your life- otherwise he will not respect you.
4.5,Alan is awesome. I knew the first time I met him that I wanted him as an advisor. He does digress and this bothers some people  but I find it interesting... he has so much knowledge and so much to add. If you want an inspired and inspiring prof. he's for you.
4,Alan is a master of interesting/informative digressions and oozes passion for the art world. He has a bias towards the extreme avant-garde  so traditional artists may find the class a bit disheartening at first but the inspiration he imparts will drive you to push yourself in directions you wouldn't expect. A very knowledgeable  fun prof.
3,Very good guy  but unfortunately his teaching style caters primarily to students interested in pursuing very postmodern  nontraditional artistic methods
4,At first  he may seem a bit confusing  but give him time. He is truely one of the most caring and understanding individuals I've ever met. One of OSU's best!
5,Allen has opened up my mind to the possibilities and talents i can explore within myself. He allows you to give yourself permission to explore your own creative spirit and grow with it. A HUGE influence on how I make art. I am blessed to have known him  and have nothing but gratitude for what he has taught me.
4.5,He is one of the best
4.5,you just have to like Allen
4,Prof. Crocket is very knowledgable and very nice.
5,be patient with him and the good stuff will be there.
4,Tough grader  but helps a lot throughout the class period with individual's works. Very encouraging  but can be a lot of work. Mostly drawing still lives with the options of pencil  charcoal  or conte crayon as your medium.
5,Professor Taylor is a very good teacher and he always helps to give advice on what could make your art project stronger. One problem I see with him is that  for a beginning drawing course  I think he expected more previous experience than some of the other students in my class had.
5,Great professor  willing to help  available via office visits  email  and in class. NOT an easy 'A' but definitely a fun class to 'work' in.
5,I am a senior now and Taylor has been  by far  my favorite professor. The classes are well structured and he gave up plenty of class time to get projects done. Instructor Taylor encouraged me to develop ideas (but if I was stuck he was always able to help). His classes set up a solid foundation for any art student.
5,Great professor. So amazingly nice.
5,"Great professor! Loved to talk about art as well as other subjects. Very helpful and willing to give personal attention to everyone. Encouraged students to think for themselves. A+ Oh  wait  OSU's grading system only goes to A. OK  an ""A"" then!"
5,i have taken many classes with chris  he is one of the best prof. i have had  he is always lookin to help and make ur project better.
5,This professor is very involved and loves what he is teaching  if your not an art major or have art experience in highschool this class will be vary hard. He expects you to have basics! Don't do it if you want an easy A
5,I had him before i transfered to OU. I miss his art classes and he loved everything I did. VERY cool guy  loves students who do more work than asked. I got an A in every (4) class I took of his!
5,I also took art 208 with chris! He's soooo awesome! and very helpful... chris rocks my world! GOSH!
4.5,Chris  you rock man! I friggin' love you!

5,not an easy A  but a really serious artist
4.5,Ernie obviously knows what he's talking about and is very arrogant at times. However  I find him very helpful and he is always willing to go over things again  even though he looks at you like you're stupid. Not an awful class.
4.5,I have to say Ernie Rice is helpful  no doubt about it. However  he is authoritarian in class. He confiscated an adult's cell phone. He is really crass  unprofessional  verbally abusive (he will try his best to make you look stupid). He IS very full of himself  his opinion is to be taken as gospel. Overall  not a very likeable person.
4.5,He does a good job teaching Photoshop and will give input when asked. He does take role and you must attend the lab to turn in your photos.
3.5,Ernie thinks very highly of himself...can be a bit rude at times and i guess you could say he over teaches some material...very simple lab it doesn't take much to get it so i don't understand why he explained everything over and over...he also encourages people to ask questions  but tears them down and makes them look stupid when they do!
5,Gotta love this guy! He's hilarious and he knows his stuff! He's definitely helpful if you stay for the entire lab and ask questions!
5,so knowledgeable!!!
1.5,Talked too fast. Gave too much information in too little time. It was very frustrating for those who didn't already know the computer programs. Dealing with him in lab was a bad experience. Glad it's over. I guess I don't like him very much. Sorry. Avoid him if you can.
5,Ernie is a helluva guy. He'll go out of his way to help any student who takes the class seriously  or non student who's interested. His experience and technical knowledge make him an invaluable asset to the department.
1,He's not really a professor  just a glorified lab attendant. Either way  he thinks way more of himself than he should  and is terribly rude and condescending. Unfortunately  there's no way to avoid him if you take Photography. Just beware!
1,He was a jerk. Had favorites  which he chose the first day of class and if you are not in that group he occasionally pokes fun at you for not knowing an answer and humiliates you in front of everyone. Says you are making up stuff too  and humiliates you in that manner also. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS  he can HURT you if you are sensitive!
1,Never helped students  was quite bias toward students also.
2,this prof is teriable i will never ever take him again. sucks at teaching anything. however he will give you extra credit.
1.5,Has an insulting way of teaching. Makes fun of students for not understanding material. Not reliable out side of class. Never take his class ever.
1,This professor is ridiculous  his teaching method is insulting and annoying. That and he does not help anyone who doesnt understand the material  he mocks them.
4.5,Easy to understand  easy to excel. Gives extra credit questions on tests. If you can pay attention the whole period  you don't need to do the homework.
4.5,He is very helpful and will help you with any question you have  he wants you to understand and pass his class. Test aren't too bad and he is a fair grader.
1.5,Often put students down for asking questions  tests were somewhat dificult  but if you study at all you shoul dbe ok. if you can stand him  its not that bad. He wasnt very helpful inside or out of class. Vague and somewhat awful. Would never take again.
1.5,He's a nice guy  and will try his best to pass you if you show effort  but he just cant teach. He goes rediculously fast in spots  painfully slow in others  and has all his notes on overheads which he changes out b4 you finish writing. A decent prof to take but you'll wind up learning most of everything from the book. Does help in office hours.
1.5,This prof knows what he is doing but doesn't know how to explain all the points to the class clearly. He has a different way of doing math than the book. He also speaks to the class as if everyone is five years old. Another downside is that his tests are pretty much harder than the AP test itself. WORD OF ADVICE:Do the review  but it won't help you
3,Not bad on grading  not the best at getting his point across  better than some but not the best.
1.5,He was a horrible teacher. You must avoid him if you can. His exams are hard because they have tricky questions. He comes off as a very approachable guy  but beware. Gives you problems from the book to study yet none of them relates to the probs on the exams. He'll try to help you during the office hour  but still doesn't help. Goes WAY too fast!
1.5,No Comments
5,I thought Weiss was a great prof. He explained exactly how to do the homework consistently  day after day  and is extremely helpful if you take the time to see him during office hours.
5,I took calculus in high school and his class was great for more in depth understanding. However  I would not recommend his class for students who have never had calculus before  it's just too many picky things to remember when just learning the basics for the first time.
4,I think his teaching style is good. You actually learn the stuff he teaches. Thats the good thing. The bad thing is he sometimes goes really fast in class. My suggestion is that if you had calc in high school  take him. Keep up on your homework. Some of the test problems are right off the homework or review. Good Professor overall.
4.5,good for students who have had calc before  if not see him during office hours. do the maple labs right or they will screw you.
4,I've had worse math teachers in the past. I really don't understand all of the bad ratings here. If you do your homework EVERY DAY  ask questions  and do well on the tests  you should be fine. His tests aren't particularly hard  if you know what you are doing.
5,it was Precalc and that was easy but he is a great teacher  lectures and notes are helpful  tests are not difficult if you study your notes and the weekly quizes...he wants everyone to do well but had no curve  you have to earn your grade but it is not hared to do with old fashioned hard work and study.
5,This professor is awesome. I'd love to take him for every math class I have to take at Kettering. His lectures are very clear and he's always willing to help.
5,Pin-cushioning  Proportioning  and LowBalling. If you do any of these things will be ran over by a man with a pipe full of cherry tobacco  wearing a authentic Scottish bagpipers hat  plus he will take your house too. Obviously  live fast or die is a good mindset going in  but you'll never find a better teacher to prepare you for the real world.
3.5,Prof. Shangraw will come at you like a raging hawk in the very beginning of each semester. Don't worry  he gets better as you get through the program and will eventually be a nice guy to know and learn from. He is very smart and loves BLUF  Bottom Line Up Front  and will tell you exactly what he wants for each assignment.
4.5,He comes across pretty strong at first. Scary  even. I thought that he would eat me alive if i ever asked a question. Not true  he is incredibly helpful and respects you for trying and actually asking for help. Great guy  great teacher. He is too funny.
4.5,"Don't let his big bad  ""this class will kill you or I will"" attitude scare you at first. He is a really nice guy and has had a profound impact on many many students. classes not too hard  just do your work and FOLLOW DIRECTIONS  or he may eat you up for that. Is quite willing to work w/ you on things. sense of humor comes across as anger its not."
5,To say that this man is one of the best profs on this campus only begins to describe the incredibly positive impact he has had on the lives of so many of his students.
5,This guy knows his stuff. Just make sure you get things handed in on time.
5,I loved his class! I think Prof Shangraw is amazing  very knowlegeable and concise. Tough grader  but what do you expect? Its a tough field. Very helpful. He knows his stuff  plus a VERY nice guy  with hot daughters.
4,What a guy. No suprises out of him at all. He'll help you out with anything. Just show up and you'll be fine. His quizes are nothing more than writing your name on a piece of paper. We had 2 tests the entire year  which were a mid-term and a final. If you can't pass this class  do something good for yourself and change your major.
5,Well organized. Knows his stuff. Show up for call on time and hand in homework when it is due. Don't let his classroom personna fool you  he really a nice guy who cares a lot for hthe student.
5,I learned a lot
1,no one can get A in his class. He dosent change the materials over the years. If u have all essays and exams u will get an A. i dont like him personally.
2,Holy cow this is a law class not an army english class. Get a life man. This man may be the biggest jerk on campus. He is also a big fat liar.
2,What a prick
5,You will work very hard in this class but what you learn will amaze you. An excellent prof.
2.5,He cares about the formats more than the essay. I wrote a very very good informative paper  and i got 65% because my outlines weren't the way he wants them to be. Very picky.
5,The course work is demanding but rewarding. It's a weel taught class  but be sure you turn your cell phone off before you enter the classroom. I really liked this professor
5,Good Prof  very knowledgable.
5,Shangraw is the man  he reminds me of my grandpa cause he tells lots of stories but they all have some sort of meaning. He's also a big hunter- cancelled class for us today (NOV 15-firearm deer season) cause ferris univ. is too gay not to. I'm stuck coming to my other classes this afternoon.
3,He is extremely anal about how you do things. He is also extremely cocky.
4,lodi dodi
1,If you have an amazing  photographic memory  you will do well in this course. You better be able to type 100 wpm  otherwise  you miss the slides on the overhead and you need every word for tests and exams! She is very unreasonable and finicky the way she marks tests so MEMORIZE!! If you take this course  be prepared to STUDY!
1,I'm amazed at the students who praise her  and can only conclude those were students she decided were good enough to favor  as she does this a lot. She covers way too much material at an insane pace. I type faster than average and could not keep up. You better be taking ONLY this course or have an amazing memory.
3,Hard to understand  but tests are pretty straight forward
1,Has obvious favourites  is rude to people who are not her favourites. Is NOT whatsoever clear on any explanations for any type of project even after being asked many times for clarification. Is very picky as to what she wants on tests  papers and presentations. I do NOT recommend this prof  avoid her classes at all cost. I learned the hard way.
2,This professor almost made me switch my entire career plan. If you do not need her  do not take her! She is not receptive to any feedback on her teaching methods and will make you feel like an idiot if you are struggling in her classes! Overall she is not pleasant.
1,if you want to feel like a stupid idiot  this professor does a great job at it.
1,unrealistic expectations that this class takes up ALL a students time. She does not give clear explanations and gets mad at the students for questioning her. She won't let you finish writing the 1000's of long drawn out sentences on her slides so get ready and learn how to write short hand notes if you take this class. She provides NO resources.
1,This is the worst professor at BU. She provides a disrespectful learning environment and is a bad teacher. Do not take this class with this professor  most people do very poor. Take this class with another professor.
1,"Worst prof I've ever had. Rarely follows the text  ridiculous test grading scheme (.5 marks per point on 4 mark ""short answer"" questions)  uses definitions from the 70s making modern definitions ""wrong"" in her eyes  rude and unclear in explanations  talks quickly (need a laptop since notes won't be in text). If you don't need her  DONT TAKE HER!"
2.5,Dr. Edguer was extremely kind toward all her students. However  I found that she had a lot of tough material on biological terms and info in psychology courses  even though biology is not a prerequisite. If you do take a class with her  you will have to study really hard  but she treats all students with respect and is always open for questions.
3,I took her abnormal psych class first then intro to bio psych. She is a very nice person and genuinely cares abut her students. Honestly taking her classes taught me how to study better. Basically study everything especially test notes i only used textbook for clarification & if she couldn't cover something in class. Work hard don't procrastinate!
2.5,Tough class. She expects endless amounts of detail in your short answer questions on tests. The M/C are tough too. Nice lady though who is very knowledgeable in psychology. Reading the textbook helped me a lot in the class. She has in-class assignments worth marks so make sure to attend all classes to get some easy marks!
4.5,Took Behavioural Neuro with her and she's awesome. Willing to help with anything. Not an easy course  but if you work hard  you'll do okay.
1.5,Probably the worst prof I had while in university. If you do not need to take her classes  I suggest you stay away!
1.5,Mean  critical and makes fun of students. I would not recommend this professor. Unclear instructions and unreasonable expectations. I would never take a class from her again!
2.5,frustrating  hard to listen to-explanations are not clear and strait fwd like they should be making it hard to pay attention. Opposite to Olsens teaching.
1,No Comments
1,I really hate this prof. Accent makes her unintelligible. Spends way too much time on stupid things  as a result we are way behind in the course material.
4,amazing! very   very tough marker and expects a ton of detail! but so kind and caring and interested in your learning as a student. it's a grade for great-prof trade-off  but worth it!
4.5,One of my favourite profs! But an extremely hard marker. Once you get used to all the details she wants though  you can pull off an A. If you need someone to talk to  you can always talk to her  she is wonderful. I kept taking her classes because I liked her  not necessarily how hard I had to study!
5,Dude rocks  his web site and down loads helped.
4,Better than Davis I sure say that
5,He is way cute! And totally brilliant
5,This was a very difficult course  but he always took the time to make sure you understood the material. Homework was optional  but I highly recommend it since his quizzes are based off the assignments. Overall  if you work hard and seek help  this class isn't going to be too bad
5,He is great  explains things in multiple ways and can answer the questions asked in different ways until you understand. Homework is optional but is closely related to the weekly quizzes and exams. He is silly and engaging which encourages class participation. Do the homework and ask questions in class and you will do great with the professor.
5,I love this guy  he really wants his students to succeed and he's a funny guy. There's a quiz almost every week and only 2 exams. If you read the book and do homework problems on the stuff you don't understand you should be set for an A. He lets you have a cheat sheet too for the exams.
5,Great teacher! Easy to follow & understand. Show up  take notes  do the optional hw  and you will pass with an A. Quiz every week  helps you to know material and prepares you for the 2 exams. Funny  when you least expect it. Would take another math class with him as my teacher! EC at the end of semester if you come to class everyday.
5,One of the best math professors I've ever had. Attendance isn't optional  however if you attend most of his classes  he'll give you extra credit at the end of the semester. Final was lightweight and took half of the period. Real chill prof  will be taking him again in the future.
5,The best math professor in his field. Makes difficult concepts very easy to understand. Gives homework everyday for practice but also solves it for you next day  do those and you are all set. Extremely intelligent  helpful and knowledgeable. Makes learning easy by the way he teaches. Take him if you want to learn  be good at math & get a good grade
5,Great!
4,This teacher is amazing. Best math teacher in the whole department. You will never regret taking his math class. I am terrible at math but he is helpful and makes his goal to make his students pass. He is like a friend.
4.5,Quiz once a week  2 Tests. Lets you have a sheet with equations and formulas for the tests. He's a good teacher. If you try  you should be able to pass. Homework not graded.
4,Good professor. Has an accent but its easy to get over. Fair grader  simple quizzes. Really makes sure you understand the material.
4.5,I've always hated math and have only been average at it  but Professor Wang makes it so easy and straightforward! His class was a really easy A  and like I said  I'm not great at math. He's also super cute like he makes jokes  is passionate about math  and is overall very likable :) Would definitely take him again.
5,His accent is easy to get used to. He does have a sense of humor. Homework is not graded and he only suggests 15-20 problems each week. Quizzes are once a week as well but they are max 3-5 questions and exactly from the homework. Exams are based on the quizzes. If you hate math-take him! Lectures are simple and to the point-he is a great teacher!
3.5,He grades fairly easy. The hardest part of his class is understanding his accent. Once you get past that  class will be a pretty typical math-lecture class.
4.5,Very concerned with your understanding easy to understand once you get used to his accent. Quizzes are once a week and exams are based on what's incorporated on quiz. makes math easy to understand
4,Made calculus easy to understand. Ungraded homework everyday  but it really helped for the weekly quizzes. Tests were based on quizzes  and let you use note card for the cumulative final. Extra credit for attendance. VERY lenient for grading
5,Excellent professor. I've had him for Algebra II  Trigonometry  and Calculus. He's and excellent professor  cares very much about your understanding  grades fairly  and is always available to help.
5,He is a wonderful math professor! I had him for the fall 2012 semester. He knows his stuff and explains concepts really well. He assigns homework for each section but it is not collected or graded. Theres a quiz once a week  and its usually only 3-4 problems. I would definitely recommend him! He also is very funny
4,"Very nice guy and shows alot of enthusiasm and humor when teaching. His accent is not that bad and he doesn't speak in any broken English. Get ready to do Homework everyday and go to his office hours when needed if you expect to get an ""A""."
5,Not a blow off class. You should probably put 4 to 6 hours a week if you want to understand the material. Definetly a really good professor  one of my fav.
5,If Bingwu taught every math course at EMU  I would be a math major. He is awesome!
5,very good teacher
1.5,woo !
5,good

1,Avoid this professor who doesn't even have a CPA.
2.5,good news  he's not teaching at temple anymore took him for summer 1 2005 and reuctantly i survived  the rumours are tru  he's fu ckin crazy  he's a prick  makes u feel dumb if u ask or answer a question. Study ya a ss off go over the slides and make sure you read and find a copy of the solutions  cuz wit this mad man a prayer aint gonna help!!!
1,this man is ceazy
3.5,I was really scared to take his class after hearing all of the stories about him. He really isn't that bad. The problems on the test come straight from the homework. The multiple choice questions can kill you. I don't sense any malice in him as others suggest. I can't say the same for Brennan.
4,He really isn't that bad  if you do his work and study for his test you will get a good grade. I took him for 2 classes and I think he is a good teacher  I actually learned in his classes.
1,not recommended to take
1.5,I do well in all accounting courses except his!!! My 2nd time taking him  shows no mercy and makes you feel stupid if you answer a question wrong in class!
5,I don't know why everyone is complaining about this professor
5,He's not so bad....
1,The worst teacher I have ever had. DO NOT TAKE HIM!!! He failed me  he has no mercy. Good Luck if you do  I am going all the way to Ambler  so I don't have to take him.
1,Very mean professor  grades tough  and doesnot teach good.
1,This man is unbelievable. I study hard and always do well  except with this teacher. He is not nice and tests are knockout hard. I can't stand to even think I took this man  after all the warnings about how terrible he is. The rumors-- ALL true
1,This teacher is mean to students  laughs at questions  and unhelpful. He has been teaching advanced accounting so long  he forgets it is new to us. He needs a reality check by being forced to teach Audit for a semester. Tests are impossible to pass
1,No Comments
1,DO NOT TAKE this prof. if you are close to having a nervous breakdown before signing up for his class. YOU WILL have one as a result of taking this class.
1.5,do NOT take this professor - out of 25 ppl who initially signed up for his class  only 9 finished the class...a tiran with very tricky exams and not very clear explanations.
1,No Comments
1,If you see him on your roster run away quickly. He failed a man with 10 years of accounting experience. This student worked at a computer company audited by PWC. He knew his accounting  Sami did not. His web page--> http://www.sbm.temple.edu/%7Ehsam
5,Professor Chung is a great teacher! Sometimes  he copies and pastes HW questions directly from the textbook onto the exams  and he usually tells the class beforehand what kind of questions there'll be. Be prepared for free response questions along with multiple choice & T/F. Overall  if you study hard  you'll get an A.
5,Prof. Chung is very straight forward. If you go to all of his classes  you'll definitely get a good grade. Utilize the opportunity to go to his/his TA's office hours. He goes over test reviews in class and shows us how to do them.
1,Although Chung is a knowledgeable man and understands the material he teaches  he is an extremely rude and inconsiderate person. I witnessed a total lack of sensitivity as he heartlessly gave this student a very difficult time during office hours for no apparent reason  to the point where she was in tears and he was still giving her a blank stare.
5,No sympathy for anyone who struggles in this class. Prof. Chung gives review guides and his exams are quite similar to his exams. Even if you're not a finance major  this class isn't difficult and he is a good prof. The material isn't challenging and really it is an important course. Make sure you attend class because the powerpoints are blank
4,I really like Finance and this class was a bit of a challenge. Gives hints on what's on the test and lectures are clear. I read the book for a better understanding. Goes through a lot of information during lecture  so make sure to go because powerpoints have many many blanks.
2,Peter is knowledgeable. My problem with him is he is straight up rude. UCR should be more careful about hiring ill-mannered professors like Peter Chung and Long Gao.
4.5,Professor Chung is one of my favorite finance professor. He knows his stuff inside out and very clear in explaining concepts with real world example. I don't know why others are saying his 106 is difficult compared to others. His exams are not multiple choice  but it's not easy to get an A. The best thing is he curves the class by a lot.
4.5,Took two finance classes: BUS 106 and BUS 134 with Professor Chung. His midterms are fairly easy compared to final exam like most of the classes. He gives you study reviews before every exam and you are pretty much guaranteed B+ given that you studied all those. As long as you know his lectures  HW set A and study review  getting A is not difficult
3.5,"Smart guy.. Tells you what to study so going into his exams aren't too difficult  given the assumption you actually studied. The median is set at B-  so passing this class isn't too hard. Overall the class is good  but Chung himself can be a bit ""insensitive "" although  it doesn't take away from his overall knowledge."
4,Definitely one of the best Finance professors at UCR. If you are a Business Finance major  then it is in your advantage to take Chung for 106. Chung knows his material and is a very knowledgeable man.
3.5,I took this class twice because i never understood NPV  FV and fell behind early in the class. took this over the summer. one midterm and a final. Homework is easy. I got an A- and ill tell you how you can succeed. I READ every chapter after lecture and before discussion. Take notes during class of his PPT and ATTEND CLASS!
4,Make sure to learn NPV  PV  and FV early on in class. Understand these three key concepts and how they work. If you do  then it'll be less hard to understand the course later on. Be careful if you're taking this class with 104  106  or any Jasso class. If you do  work HARD. I like Chung  he knows his stuff  which is why he's not easy.
2.5,Class is tough. He is not very helpful and is very snarky towards students. Practice midterms don't really help because the problems are completely different on the test. Only good thing about the class was the huge curve because the class average on midterms was 60%
1,Slides have blanks  so he requires you to come to class to get the notes. His exams are extremely difficult and nothing like his practice problems. He is sarcastic and rude. He does not care about students at all.
3,Very arrogant and sarcastic. He thinks his funny but he's not! Exams are ok  have to study a lot. He is clear in his lectures  notes are always posted on ilearn. TA sessions are mandatory and also homework about once a week. Don't like his attitude at all but he explains the material pretty good.
3.5,He knows what he is talking about. All his tests are free response  so do not expect multiple choice. Depending on your class  the curve is either really good or really bad. He gives you everything you need to know for the test and drops major hints about questions. If you did not do well  its your fault not his. He does his part to help you pass.
1.5,Awful instructor. Intensely focused on theory and over-complicating subject matter to feed his own ego. Zero interest in students  arrogant  and more interested in failing students. Class average for midterms was below 70%  showing he can't teach the material he expects students to know. Avoid at all costs.
1.5,My honest comments about peter chung: Has absolutely no interest in students. No charisma. Poor manner. No passion in teaching. Cold. Unhelpful and arrogant.
4.5,Best professor I had at UCR. Took a different approach at this class. Group presentations every week. Basically a self-taught course.. No book. If you like real world finance and investment this will be a great class. And you won't have to worry about quizzes and tests.. Just learning.
2.5,This guy answers his cell phone in class. It would be one thing if it happened once  but it happens almost every day. Total disrespect for a graduate class.
5,Michaels is hands down the best professor I have ever had at PhillyU. He is incredibly intelligent and funny. I don't get bored in this class because he is always telling stories and showing us videos. Incredibly helpful  all around amazing guy! (Oh  and he brought his adorable dog to class one day. It was awesome.)
5,Take notes=Good grades!! Concise and fun professor. Very intelligent. Highly suggest taking his courses!
5,Dale Michaels is the bees knees.
5,Michaels is super awesome and super hunky. Enough said.
5,One of the best professors I've had. I would love to have him again.
5,I never took his class I am one of his patients. Dale is nothing short of a living saint. Knowing that someone like Dale is in this world makes me think if I could learn to be half as awesome as him all the pain is worth it.
5,The greatest professor at phillyU no! the world possibly the universe. I recommend u take his classes every chance you get.
5,Taken a million of his classes  and would recommend each one. Love him!
5,def the best psych professor at phillyu!! he always keeps it interesting...tests are SUPER easy - just study the topics he gives you on the study guide and guarenteed A. shows lots of videos in class  too. definitely take Michaels!!!
5,god is to creation as michaels is to awesomeness
5,Great Teacher!
5,This professor is truly a God. He is so incredible and he doesn't even know it. The way he talks is mesmerizing and he can keep your attention for hours (that is if you can concentrate without staring at his gorgeous body). He is one of the smartest people I have ever met and is so willing to help students in need.
5,Well...besides being a beautiful man  he is brilliant and mysterious. I love his class..lectures are easy to follow
5,Ok  so the guy can't help that he is very attractive  however he is a great teacher who makes sure you actualy learn the info  not just memorize it for the tests-that's impt if u want to be successful.
5,Prof. Michaels is an absolute genius. he's very willing to help students.
4,No Comments
5,clear  interesting lectures  the infamous study guides  one 4 page paper about anything you want  welcomes comments and questions. all around great prof. and by the way  he is not a Dr. he only has his master's. brilliant.
5,"Great Professor! Outlines for every lecture make note taking easy  study guides for tests  and specific handouts = Easy A! Good quality material and a great speaker. ""From a developmental standpoint..."" Take Michaels if you can."
5,Best teacher ever! The one thing that sums his teaching style up is that you will remember everyrhing for years to come... He is so effective that its sometimes creepy... Its all in his perfect communication skills! LOVE YA DALE!!!
5,One of he best professors philly u. has. Truly wants his students to succeed and will do almost anything to get them there.
4,Todd's really fun in class and defintiely into what he's teaching. Be ready for him to get really side tracked and share quite a bit about his personal life. It's almost always hilarious though. He really cares about what he teaches and when he assigns readings  you really do need to do them. If not  you can get by but it'll be difficult.
5,Todd is a great prof and film can be a difficult concept but he is able to put it in simple terms for new students. His quizzes are based of the film  lecture  and readings so as long as you attend class and screenings you should do well. The exams are straightforward and everything you need to know is on the study guide. He's super sarcastic too
5,Ask him a question  he'll always answer. He explains complex theories in ways you can understand  he's understanding if you're strugglingcan't turn something in on time. He's hilarious  and he's the best!
1.5,He is excited about class and knows a lot about film. Though he gives quizzes on random days and never discusses the readings on which the quizzes are on. The tests cover material that he has not discussed and you must learn on your own. I would have never taken this class with him if it wasn't mandatory for my minor.
5,Todd's class is one of the best classes I have ever taken--certainly one of the funniest. To do well on the quizzes  you have to do the reading  but the tests are usually pretty easy. He makes lectures and silent cinema fun and exciting. Smart and funny.
5,Charismatic...Can make jokes at himself and others. One of the best guys I've ever met. He infuses a love of cinema in you!
4.5,Really passionate and his enthusiasm is contagious. Has a tendency to go off on tangents  and on tangents of tangents  but always gives the class an offbeat  positive atmosphere. I may have more of his personal quotes written down than actual notes  but his teaching style is so engaging that abstract concepts become much easier to grasp.
4,As someone who has awful ADD and no interest in movies  I still looked forward to coming to Todd's class every day. The material is easy enough to grasp  although he tests directly on readings that are never discussed in class. Still  Todd is always good for a few laughs.
5,I love Todd! I thoroughly enjoy attending his class  he makes it extremely entertaining.
4.5,Todd is my favorite teacher that I've had  ever. He is such a good person and makes every class fun- I hate missing his lectures. If you can  take a class with him and get to know him  you won't regret it.
4,Brilliant and has a great sense of humor.
4.5,Charismatic guy  loved going to class and he made all of us laugh a lot. I didn't do the reading ever  not so great on the reading quizes  not so great on the tests  still got a B-. Definitely recommend this guy  especially if you do the reading  but even if you just want to laugh for an hour and 15 minutes twice a week.
5,I have to agree with everyone else here - Todd is the best teacher I have ever had. He's a really quirky and hilarious. His higher-level courses are difficult  but if you make a real attempt at understanding the content he is decently lenient with grading. If you EVER have a chance to take a class with him  DO IT. Great advisor and mentor too.
5,I have attended 3 schools  and Todd is the best professor I have had at any of the schools. I was not really interested in the class content at all  but he made it interested anyways. His lectures are hilarious they are better than sleeping in.
4,i think i could videotape his lectures and make a very good tv show about him. he is very interesting and keeps me engaged. very very funny and insightful. i would recomend it to anyone  this is my last semester and i am very glad i signed up for this class
5,Funniest teacher I have ever had. And really hot.
5,Todd is the best professor i've ever had (like many other students here). I honestly believe he is a complete genius. His lectures are absurdly interesting (and laugh-out-loud hilarious)  his assignments are relevant and reasonable  and his ability to relate complex information is unparalleled. Todd has changed my life and i couldn't be happier
5,The best teacher at UVM. Hands down.
5,Todd is one of the best profs I've had in 2 years at UVM. He's hilarious  insightful  and really knows his stuff. His lectures are pretty much like a comedy act  and throughout them he makes 5 or 6 critical points that are easy to pick up on and understand. Take a class with this man if you have the chance!

2.5,Dr. Gfellner in her prime was apparently an amazing professor. I think she's gotten burnt out over the years and her class content reflects it. I passed because I bought the textbook and just took notes from it. I blocked her out during class and just did my own thing from the textbook. Her wardrobe is super jazzy though. Interesting to look at.
1.5,Memorization & regurgitation seem to be paramount. No powerpoints made available. Unrealistic in her expectations. Confusing lecturer.
1.5,She is boring and not very clear  she speaks very quietly so sit near the front of the class.
1,Beyond brutal: doesnt give you enough time to even finish writing what's on the powerpoint (which are not given). Talks about irrelevant studies constantly. You must keep up with reading the text. Tests are ridiculously difficult.
1,I'm in grad school and looking back at all the prof's I've had over the years  she sands out as being horrible more than anyone. Should've been fired back in 2002!!!!!!
2.5,Notes are horrible and doesnt give you a chance to write them down  also doesnt post them online. Very very boring classes. Prof says 'um' at least 300 times a class. May be a nice person  but prob the worst prof on campus...not even exaggerating
4,Okay  I am taking my third class with her. I've got to agree with the majority. At first she was my least favorite teacher and I found her useless..etc..boring..etc...scattered  you get the picture. But I ended up with an A and A+ in the two prior classes i've taken with her and you really do start to understand her teaching methods
3,Very nice but not a great prof. You spend the whole class trying to write down notes from the overhead (while she talks about someting else) before she whips them away. Tests are way too long for the amount of time given - don't take this class if you're looking for an easy A!
1,Horrible! very disorganized  all over the place. I got an A but because I learned the whole book on my own  I do not recommend her classes!!!
4.5,amazing  beautiful person. so caring and passionate about her subject area. more than fair tests  interseting lectures  and always willing to offer extra help! super fun lady! awesome classes.
1.5,I took this calss with her and it was terrible. I didnt know what she was even talking about because I was too busy taking her useless notes. I admit I failed. I toke it again with another prof and now I have a 89 average!!
4,Herr exams are tough  study it all  boring lectures
2.5,i was really looking forward to this class... and it was a total let down. boring lectures  out of the blue questions on exams... she's a very nice person  and quite helpful... but i still don't recommened this class.

1,this prof is the worse prof ever! if i knew how bad she was i wouldn't of even taken that course and too bad no one told me about her sooner! thanks alot guys! i think she should be FIRED!
2.5,Study the chapter highlights and the multiple choice from the study guide and you'll do fine. Her notes are useless when it comes to the tests.
1,I never had her but my roomate did and she cried all the tome caus eshe studied soooooooo hardthen the tests would be on nothing they covered in class(she had her twice). Avoid this teacher she seems a little crazy
1.5,No Comments
1,She is the abo****e worst teacher that I have ever had. I skipped her class for three weeks and still aced her test. All she does is highlight the textbook.
4,Dr Arrey is an extremely funny and smart professor. Many people find him to be mean  but he truly wants everyone to pass. His class is extremely hard  but its pretty straightforward. STUDY EVERYTHING IN HIS PACKETS
5,Dr. Arrey is the best professor I've ever had. No other professor has ever given so much of their time to help me succeed. Accelerated ochem 1&2 are no joke but if you put in your time (at least 5 hours/day)  go to office hours  and participate in class  you can get that A.
5,Dr. Arrey wrote the book on Organic Chemistry. Literally. He uses a textbook that he wrote himself. The funny thing is  it's more helpful than traditional textbooks. Dr. Arrey has such a unique  and often hilarious  way of explaining difficult concepts that achieving highly is inevitable. Study hard  go to office hours  and don't be a Chlorine Guy.
4,Dr. Arrey is a great professor  and one of the best I have ever taken. His class is definitely tough  but as long as you work pretty hard and go talk to him in his office when you have questions  you won't get anything less than a B+.
1.5,Very hard to understand what he wants. The material is very difficult  but if you get on his good side he can be an enjoyable guy.
2,I stopped liking Chemistry because of this professor. He would not hear comments and will try by all means to not give points back even if it was his mistake.
2.5,His classes are not easy. It can be hard to understand him. I suggest going to office hours and talking to him after class. Be active in his class. He seems mean  but he can be very pleasant.
4,Now being in medical school and thinking back to undergrad  the only class that remotely compares to the work load and amount of material is Dr Arrey's Organic Chem. If you want to know what med school will be like   this is the class to take. and trust me   i complained as much as anyone else. Dr Arrey is an excellent instructor.
2,Dr. Arrey  as he constantly refers to himself as in the third person is terrible
2.5,Hardest class I have ever taken. He always puts questions on the exam that we never have talked about. You have to memorize an ungodly amount of notes for each exam. The highest grade in that class anyone has yet received is a B.
1.5,Very self-centered. Very egotistical. Hard to understand & does not care whether you get the material or not. Has a God complex  so don't get on his bad side. Do NOT recommend.
1,"""The son of god""  as he once referred to himself in class  is probably without a doubt the worst teacher I have ever had. It would also be nice if I could understand half of what he said  which makes an already hard class even harder. Couldn't be happier to be done with his class."
1.5,Impatient  unpleasant  rude  insensitive  I could go on. Shamelessly favoritist and egotistical  bordering on megalomaniacal. The only teacher at Capital I've ever disliked. Do yourself a favor and take OChem in summer school or somewhere else at all costs.
3,One of my least favorite professors. He is impatient and expects you to already know the new material and is frustrated when you don't understand. He teaches his lectures in a screaming tone-usually end up with a headache afterwards. He assigns ridiculous amounts of assignments that useless to the content of the class. Never again.
2,Terribly hard class
1.5,"Not a great teacher...at all. he is funny sometimes  but it would be more useful to hear information on the class rather than how many ""friends"" we have."
4.5,Good
1.5,So hard and you can't understand him with his accent
1,He is very selfish and arrogant. On one occasion he threatened to put a curse on everyone (NOT KIDDING). In my opinion  he puts a black mark on capital. I would strongly advise anyone considering capital summer school to avoid Arrey.
3.5,I had Dr. Arrey for a year for ochem and I think the class is very challenging but he works very hard to help you and I enjoyed him as a person as well!
2.5,This prof. is hard...this class is hard and you HAVE to study for it! he is a good prof. but not easy. The lab does help and try to show up to class it seems like that makes a difference to him...If this is the only class you have then probably will do good.
5,This course was tough but he explained things really well and told you exactly what would be on the test so you didn't waste your time studying worthless crap.
5,Shannon is probably the best psych prof at BU (however my 2nd and 3rd choices are right behind her!) She always tries to make examples relatable so you are able to remember them better! She also tries so very hard to be available to you and correspond to your needs! If you have a chance to take a class with Shannon  do it!!!
4,Tests are reasonably easy if you prepare  you are given test outlines! She is very helpful  gives opportunity for extra marks (bonus assignments) at the end of the semester. She is very well organized and to the point  one of my best professors.
5,Professor Gadbois was very organized
4.5,Gadbois is entertaining and easy to listen to. As long as you commit to learning  she will do everything she can to make sure you are successful in her courses. Fair grader  gives lot's of feedback and even outlines for her exams. I LOVE her! Almost makes me want to switch to a psych major so I can continue taking her courses.
1,More work required for the final exam than 4th year major projects  and minimal feedback. I feel like I'm guessing to find the exact study she wants cited.
4.5,Absolutely LOVE Shannon's classes! She's hard to catch in person  but always available through email and gets back to you really fast! I found her tests super easy as long as you pay attention in class and study! Definitely would take ANY class with her again! Best class ever.
5,Gadbois gives you the best feedback on your exams because she goes through each short answer question and we exactly she was looking for. Also the night before the exam she has group chat online so you can ask her any last minute questions you may have which helps everyone so much! Definitely taking more of her classes in the future!
5,Amazing! She genuinely cares if you do well  provides excellent feedback and as long as your putting in the work  she will work with you! Never seen someone care as much as her and especially in a course with very challenging content. Down to earth  easy going and very brilliant. Wish she taught all my courses :)
4.5,Very straight forward  blunt at times. But its strategic  and she truly is a remarkable prof and genuine person.
5,Shannon is a professor sent from the heavens. Not only is she sarcastic and hilarious but she's compassionate and genuinely wants her students to do well. She gives detailed lectures and gives you time to write down your notes. She respects how hard it is to be a student and she has helped me not only in her class but in my other classes as well.
5,Best psychology prof that BU has by far!! I enjoyed going to her classes and listening to her stories. Her tests are fairly easy if you study enough. Gives bonus marks to help boost your mark. She also gives out test reviews  and make sure you go to class and know what information will be emphasized on for the tests!
5,Greatest professor I've ever had. If you print her slides off moodle that is basically your exam. If you go to class she makes it very exciting and interesting to listen to not boring at all she references celebrities and tells funny stories to help clarify information and is very approachable if you need help. Take her for every class possible
5,Outstanding prof! You know exactly what to study for the exams. One time she referenced Pitbull and Shakira and that's when I knew it was going to be a good semester.
5,BEST PROF EVER! and I'm not even that interested in psychology but I needed some social sciences.. totally takes an interest in helping her students succeed! :)
5,Dr. Gadbois is a fantastic prof  definitely one of the best profs I've ever had. Her tests are extremely fair  she gives outlines so you know exactly what to study  her lectures are engaging  she WANTS you to succeed. Take a class with her  your GPA will thank you.
5,Great prof! Really knows her stuff  and makes it easy to study from tests. Gives real life examples that help to make learning more clear. Great sense of humor. Very honest. Really awesome person  and great prof. Recommended!
4,Awesome prof!! Is very clear about things and marks fair. Used many helpful real life examples. Helped me enjoy Psychology and keep on taking it.
4,Gadbois is a wonderful professor. She knows her stuff  she is very personable and explains things in non-psych terms so it is easier to understand!
4.5,She was great  I can't think of anyway she could have possibly made it easier. She gives you all the lectures on Moodle  she tells you exactly what to study for tests  gives you practice q's. Plus she's interesting. As you can see from the pic being present  she's really into utilizing online tools.
5,Very informative and obviously knows what see's doing. After you get to know her she becomes a really great person to talk to  whether the questions are about her classes or others unrelated to her at all.
4.5,Paciocco presented the material in clean fashion. Sometimes he jumped around  especially during the winter term  but his lectures are inspiring and amazingly knowledgeable. If you want to learn criminal law the right way  Paciocco is your man. Just be prepared for rigorous fact pattern exams.
5,This class will stand out as one of the best you will take. Paciocco has a phenomenal understanding of the material and is one of Canada's leading experts. He is also an equally brilliant orator/lecturer. The materials and exams are challenging  but absolutely worth it. Do whatever you can to take his classes.
4,Excellent professor  focused and detailed in all of his lectures. Passionate about the field and expresses this in his lectures.
5,Paciocco is one of the top professors at the law school  and one of the best I've ever had. He has high expectations for his students  but he teaches well and sets out his expectations. His lectures are completely stimulating. There is a reason this man is so popular even though his courses are relatively difficult.
3,Although Paciocco is a leader in his field  he does make the material more difficult to understand than need be. His classes are incredibly stimulating  but  again  he should keep things simple. I found his final  compared to the mid-term  particularly difficult. Beware of this. Expect him to ask you to do a memo and essay for the final.
4.5,"Pacioccco is ""God"" & if you have him count yourself lucky. His lectures are fascinating  and I'm always tempted to clap at the end of each lecture. He's an excellent speaker  although I wish sometimes he would allow us the opportunty to digest some of his ideas. His exams and marking are fair."
4.5,He doesn't teach bird courses. Teaches some tough material  but every lecture and the whole course are always well-organized and well-structured. The structure is your friend. Use it  you'll get a good Paciocco mark.
4.5,This man is so brilliant that he can barely explain the law to you  as he focuses too much on its inherent problems. Still  figure it out and you're learning from the best..
4.5,Professor Paciocco brings a practical point of view to both criminal law and the law of evidence. Very good writer and teacher. You'll learn a lot.
5,Super Nice! Great teacher. Super helpful. If you show up and put in effort she will help you to get a good grade!
4,I had Deb for several classes  and she is a good professor. She tries very hard to give her students the independence and respect they deserve as adults. She is very straight-forward and willing to help with any issues you may have.
3.5,"this class was extremely boring  easy  but boring  the teacher although enthusiastic and willing to help didn't use one of the books that was ""required"" for the course. This course didn't really require much teacher student communication and was too easy to require help  the real problem is having the motivation to show up to class."
4.5,Excellent teacher. Provides all the necessary resources to succeed. As for me  I hate economics. I basically just memorized the material and regurgitated it back out for exams. Not the teacher's fault  though. She tries very hard to make the subject digestible. I just have a hard time with ECON stuff.
5,Deb is a great teacher. She clearly explains the material and lets you know right where you stand. I highly recommend this teacher.
5,Class is very clear  if you pay attention to what she says and take notes class  it will be a breeze. Tries to present real world examples of class material.

5,WONDERFUL professor. Makes a tough subject easy to understand. Wants you to know it and enjoy it  not memorize things and puke them back on a test. Somewhat flighty  but funny. Makes jokes about her husband that are funny since hes also a prof at CCC. Would take more classes if I wasn't graduating.
5,This class is alot of reading but all of the novels are really good! I had to take this class for my major  and ended up likeing it!! He is kind of a goofy guy but super nice.
5,Funny that I'm rating a professor when I haven't had him for a class for a few years - but he is definitely one of the best.
5,I adore this man. SO awesome. Such a great professor.
4.5,My favorite class of the semester! Dr. Borders is hilarious  insightful  and a talented professor. He is very straightforward and doesn't take crap from anyone  and his tests are a little difficult. I loved this class so much that I was truly disappointed when I overslept once.
4,Good over all  just be prepared for A LOT of reading very quickly!
5,Well I've had DB for tons of classes  not just 1400. He is hilarious  insightful  inspirational. He doesn't put up with bad work  lateness  or attitudes. He is one of AU's best  and I don't even think he knows how good he actually is. His classes are something to look forward to. GOD BLESS THIS MAN.
5,Dr. Borders makes literature come alive. He allowed me to see depth in passages that I would never have seen myself. Excellent professor!
5,This man cracks me up! I absolutely love going to his class everyday! He is an awesome teacher! I think everyone needs to take a lit class with him! Yah  go DB!
5,I had several classes with Scott in my years at AU. He's a great person  and loves the subjects he teaches.

5,He makes you do the work  but he makes the class alot of fun.
5,Loved the class  he made it enjoyable and fun. He was helpful and clear about his expectations and everyone knew what he expected from us.
4.5,Extremely helpful and available. Highly intelligent  you will learn alot from any of his classes if you will let yourself!
3.5,He is very funny. I don't really enjoy reading but he makes it worth it.
5,Great prof  very knowledgeable and funny.
4,very enthusiastic and fun! definitely has passion for the subject!
5,VERY energetic and fun!
5,Very challenging  yet in a way that the class knows exactly what is required. I promise that you will learn more than you ever expected!
4.5,No Comments
5,Great professor  would highly recommend him.
1,She was so nasty to students and embarassed everyone whenever she got the chance. Terrable teacher. Why did she become one if she hates students????
1,No Comments
1,What a clown! We all couldn't stand the class! Glad she's gone - her book is a joke.
1,worst teacher ever. does not know how to teach to the students. degrades student .. and tell student they will make it towards their proffesion. she knows a lot just dont know how to teach for anything. serious power trip and her best friend is the the book .. shes terrible ..
1,this prof. is not helpful at all.she tells you to go back over your and read it again.if you do not have a one word ans. on your test you can not give her a sentence she will not accept it even if it's right
1,The worst professor I've ever wasted my money on. I don't think the space is enough to write on her inefficiency of teaching.
1.5,Doesnt know how to communicate to her students. Degrades her students by telling them they'll never make it in the health profession. Has no professor student interaction at all and refers to the book when questions are ask. Teaches to 1 sec of class.
4,The best preparation for MCAT's (biology section(
1,No Comments
1.5,I had to drop this evil woman's class. She is apparently getting everyone ready for the nursing boards     even those of us who don't have to take it! I never had trouble with advanced Physics  and have a 3.52 average  so beware Avoid at all costs!
1.5,"She doesnt teach to the whole class  only to about 10 people  she never repeats anything  if you miss it  too bad! You cannot ask a question of the related material  her reply is ""it's in the book!"". She writes small and God help you if you nee"
1,She is a very unreasonable tough grader. Attendance is mandatory although you are allowed to miss four class days she will not respond to your emails about missed work. She hardly teaches so be prepared to read and seek tutoring . If you have educational questions about a lesson she will embarrass you and ignore you as well.
3,she will help you learn a lot about writing. you need to be organized and do your work.
4.5,She is a tough teacher but she will make sure you learn how to write a paper on a college level and make sure you come to class on time everyday cause she will point and snap you out her class. very funny.
5,Best professor ever
1.5,She will give out homework  but she never picks it up. She will also tell us to not be scared to ask her questions but when you ask her questions she will explode and no answer your question.
5,Dr. M. Jackson-Jones is the professor everybody wants. She is always on point  very knowledgeable  understanding  charismatic  and interesting teacher. I had her for World Literature and there simply isn't a better teacher. She doesn't play any games and definitely doesn't put up with foolishness. She gives and deserves respect. RESPECT
5,I took Professor Jackson-Jones in 1991-92. She is an outstanding instructor! The skills that she has bestowed upon me has helped me with term papers  essay  etc. I am so thankful for her!
4.5,I love her!!! We get along great she is a wonderful teacher!!!!
5,I Love Her Class...I Have Learned A lot!
5,Im very happy I was able to hv Dr. Jackson-Jones as my writing professor. She is very passionate abt her work.
5,I've been out of school for almst 20yrs. Dr. Jackson-Jones made my new endeavor very interesting. Im very happy that I was able to have her as my professor.The work at times was overwhelming but well worth it. She is very passionate abt her wk. She will always be a professor I will hv the upmost respect for. Evrythg in life is not easy.Thk u Dr.J!
5,Dr. Jackson-Jones is a very well structured teacher. she tells you what she wants and pushes you to do your best. She TRUELY cares about her students. she will go above and beyond for you. I wish I had her for 101 and beyond.
4.5,Mrs. Jackson is a character and she expects you to work hard. She explains her material clearly and gives a lot of hand outs. I would recommend her to someone who has been out of school for a while. You should pass her class with a B or better.. She is not a hard teacher and do not get on her bad side!!!!!!!!!!
5,I AGREE WITH THE PRIOR STUDENT...THIS IS NOT HIGH SCHOOL!!!SHE IS A GREAT TEACHER!THE BEST ENGLISH TEACHER I'VE EVER HAD.DISREGARD THE NEGATIVITY BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE MORE FOCUSED ON HER THAN HER TEACHING!
5,Dr.Jackson-Jones is highly recommended. She knows so much about her subject
1,This instructor is very hard  and shows much favortism towards men.She is very arrogant.No matter how good you think your work is believe me she will pick it apart in a hot minute.She braggs about being tenured  and her grading is more subjective than objective.All I can say is good luck  and it will be benefical to you if you stay on her good side
2.5,she is a alright professor just get u ready for the real deal so it's on how ready u think u r for college GOOD LUCK.
1,i was out of school for ten years before i took her class and would not explain anything she is the worst teacher ever
2.5,If you are a student who has been away from school for an extended time  I highly recommend that you do not take this instructor. She will belittle you and shake what confidence you have in your writing abilities. She is disrespectful  and a bit of a narcissist.
1,Uses intimidation to control students. Is more concerned about personal time than helping students. Most students in her class do not enjoy going because she is demonstrative and rude. My advise is to take another teacher because it is clear that she is just collecting a paycheck. There are much better teachers at the school.
1.5,boring! dis-org-a-nized! no flow or logical sequencing to lectures. but exams are given to you before writing  so know what to expect. easy grade  hella long classes.
3,His lectures are all over the place  but I love how he tells you a lot of what's gonna be on the exams. Good guy.
2.5,Too much to say in too little time  almost half of what is said is over my head. He is very smart  but hard to follow. I have a hard time sitting through class. The more you know the higher your mark (as it should be)
2,Very unorganized  but very fair. He is very helpful one on one  but in a group  he tends to be unclear.
1,Awful prof!! Most horrible boring class you'll ever take. Very unorganized and his lectures make no sense. Half the time he talks about some house he built!
4,Great course! He made class enjoyable! very laid back and easygoing!
4.5,very very intelligent! Funny  helpful  and a cat lover!!
4,Why dont you try to improve you lovely news paper and actually make it more professional and instead of insulting everyone
5,I have never have had Greg as a teahcer but he is a wonderful advisor for the Hudsonain at HVCC. HE is relaxed and around if you need help. We appreciate you pork chop.
1,OMG!!! RUNNNNNNNNN!!!! Horrible professor!! His tests are so hard!! His slides are a waste of time! No review sheet. Very unprofessional !! Makes you look like an idiot when you as a question. Does not deserve to be a professor!!!! RUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!
5,Outstanding professor  possesses a charisma and passion for subject matter that will keep you engaged and learning the whole way through. Knowledgeable and willing to answer any question. Tough in the sense that you have to do your work. Highly recommend.
4,Before I lament on the difficulty  I did receive an A in his class. The only way this is possible is if you study a great deal  don't wait until the last minute. Hint: his tests are harder than the final  but make sure you do as well as you can on them. If you're a nursing major  this class is a joke compared to 150  so his difficulty will help you
2.5,This professor is no joke  ridiculously tough. Although a nice guys and tries to lighten up the mood in class. His tests are extremely hard because they're on a powerpoint and you have a minute to answer. Better off reading the textbook than his slides. Gave a very small curve. I studied hard and got a C. Nobody in that class got higher than a B.
2,Okay.... His class is BEYOND hard. He has good intensions but is NO HELP. He feeds you such interesting things that will have NOTHING to do with anything on exams. You will HATE this class. My tip is  If you want to pass the class Read the chapters you need atleast 3 times and answer all of the review questions after the chapters. YOUR BEST BET.
1.5,Ridiculous - lectured as if we had a phd in bio - has to be the worst teacher I've ever had
2.5,The hardest class i have ever taken  he teaches as if we are all moving on to pursue our careers in medicine it's ridiculous IT'S AP HIGH SCHOOL BIO! HARD TESTS! STUDY YOUR ASS OFF! I wouldn't recommend him if you are only taking this course just to take a 100 level science and a lab but if you are pursuing in nursing take him.
3.5,He is an interesting teacher who tries hard to entertain the class. My only problem with him was that his tests are very difficult even if you study. He is very intelligent and knows his stuff. I would suggest him  but just be prepared for hard tests!!
1.5,professor scherb goes by the slideshows really fast and his tests are hard. you would have to work really hard in order to pass the class and he puts the lectures on blackboard. choose another professor if you can!
1,Honestly  Half of what he teaches is based on experience. You know when a teacher tried too hard to make you laugh?.... He honestly made my freshmen year taking biology SUCK so bad. I hated every second. I'm an A student and this class made me struggle. His PowerPoint are 10% based on the Test you're on your own in this class. STAY AWAY
4,This professor doesn't play any games. Test are on PowerPoint slides and you have a minute to answer each question. He teaches off PowerPoint but you have all the material you need for the exams on the slides and in your textbooks. You HAVE TO STUDY. Point blank There's no getting around it. Half the class dropped after the 3rd exam. U study u pass
3.5,Professor Scherb wants you to pass but tests are extremely difficult. I studied my ass off and barely passed each time with a curve. This guys is brilliant  a wealth of knowledge  I just wish somehow the tests were easier. I studied each chapter and review sheets I made three times each  took off from work to study and still had difficulty.
2.5,Nice guy  but ridiculous teaching. His lessons are straight from the PowerPoint. You pretty much have to learn all the material on your own. He treats the class as if we are all going to be continuing with biology. This class will lower your Gpa.
2.5,he forgets the concept of Gen Eds. he's harder than he has to be considering half the students in the class are forced to be their by the curriculum. why powerpoints exams? everyone has their own speed and the right to look back at the questions. who's he to eliminate these options? and why are the questions worded like the lsat?
4.5,Very personable and easy to approach. Teaches mostly through PowerPoint slides. Gives no HW only reading assignments. Tests are PowerPoint slides  50 slides  50 minutes and no going back. Final was multiple choice and three essays to choose from out of six. Utilize his office hours  study the material and the course is not that difficult. Grade: B-
1.5,he does not explain or review anything..i found myself looking on the computer for help!!! take another prof quick!!
4.5,~ Use Power Point Slides & has a good sense of humor. If you read the chapters and understand the topic and go through the audio clips that he provides on blackboard  it an easy pass. Just give in the effort to read and understand the topic and you do extremely well on his test.
1,csi needed to have fired him long ago. everything you read here is true. not only is he an unqualified teacher but for students that struggle-hell make sure to point you out in class for an answer. horrible teacher and person.
1,DO NOT!!! AND I REPEAT DO NOT TAKE HIM!! HE MADE ME HATE BIOLOGY. HE EXPECTS YOU TO STUDY 6 HRS A DAY LIKE YOU DONT HAVE A LIFE. HE DOESN'T ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS -NO REVIEW... AND 75% OF WHAT YOU STUDIED ISNT ON THE TEST. ONLY TAKE HIM IF YOU WANT TO SIGN OVER YOUR SANITY... WHAT A FREAKING WASTE
1,Professor Scherb was terrible! I took his bio course and was so lost! I am a very smart person and an even better student but professor Scherb changed all that! His tests are very difficult  he belittles you and embaresses you among your classmates and he flirts with alot of the girls  very unprofessional. AVOID THIS CLASS BY ALL MEANS
5,Dr. Estrada is awesome. I had her for 2 semesters. Her class isn't too hard  but you learn a lot of Spanish. She makes you participate  which helps you learn really well. Her test aren't too bad either. Just study up before them.
4.5,She's kind of annoying with the way she teaches and assigns- it's a little juvenile. But you come out of it really knowing the material  and she really does want to help you.
5,Dr. E is absolutely one of the best professors on campus. She knows more about Spanish than any professors I've had  and does her absolute best to help you learn everything you can. She integrates the language with the cultural experience and encourages students to expand their world  and to have fun while doing so.
4.5,Dr. Estrada is an extremely helpful teacher. She keeps Spanish fun and makes you want to learn the material. Although sometimes a little too peppy in the morning  she always knew how to keep the class exciting. She knows her stuff and I would recommend her to anyone
5,Dr. E is by far the best professor I have ever had. She helps you understand the Spanish languages so well and she is very very nice. I high suggest taking her if you have the chance. She spends so much of her time helping you  its crazy.
5,Dr Estrada is a wonderful teacher. She makes everything so clear and easy to understand. She inspires you to reach your potential while being understanding of your problems. Her tests and assignments are easy if you come to class and try to learn the material. I highly recommend Dr E!
5,Wonderful prof. I didn't plan to continue on with spanish after I fulfilled my requirements  but she inspired me to do that. She's very helpful and is always helping plan very cool activities.
5,Very knowledgable! I learned more from her in one semester than I learned in a couple of years in high school.
4.5,Very friendly and helpful prof. I enjoyed the class  even if my own lack of effort put me behind at times. Class was always a lot of fun  and we usually managed to learn some things too.
4.5,I'm really glad to have taken Spanish with Estrada. She gives too many handouts  but she's great! And she's pretty funny.
5,She is a mentor to me.... truly my hero Thank you Nancy Estrada I feel really connected to you.

4,I didn't do that well in the class  but was mostly my own fault  plus the fact that I wasn't really prepared by HS Spanish. Dr. Estrada is a good teacher  and very friendly.

4.5,Richard Shockey is a hottie!
4,I loved Professor Sadkowski. He's a very funny guy with somewhat interesting lectures. You have to read a lot in his class or else you won't pass. His quizzes are based from his mini-books you have to read along with the class one. Read or else you won't pass. It's pretty hard to without them.
5,I loved his class. His sense of humor was amazing. He also attempted to learn everyone's name. The only problem I had with the class is that I didn't care for some of the books.
3,WAY too much work for an LAC Humanities course. He's a great  funny guy  but this class was difficult and I went to every class and hardcore studied. The course guidebook helps IMMENSELY- it has study guides in it  but tests are still difficult. Make sure you read the books he assigns. The grading scale is SUPER lenient- I got a 75% which is a B.
3,Sadkowski was a nice guy but his lectures were really boring and there was a lot of reading involved. Tests were difficult but he has a pretty nice grading scale  so it evens out a bit.
3,Sadkowski is one of the nicest professors I've ever had. I took humanities 3 with him and his lectures can get really boring because all he does it talk and you have to look through your course packet and write down what he says. If you don't follow along then you won't pass. He gives study guides to use before the tests  but overall I liked him
1,Sadkowski is the worst professor I've had at UNI. Sadkowski lacks organization  shows up late to class daily  is regularly not prepared  and fails to make this course interesting. He relies on the textbook to cover all of his material. Sadkowski teaches heavily through pointing at maps and listing European countries  dates  and leaders rapidly.
3,Sadkowski lectures the entire class and it can get boring. There are only 4 exams and a couple of quizzes for grades and even with doing all the reading they were pretty difficult. He gave EC on the last two exams which was really nice. He is a nice guy and has some funny stories to tell at times. If you ask him a question he is glad to answer it.
4,Overall I was pleased with the class mainly lectures  some movies every now and then  and you don't need to do the readings. Sometimes it was hard to stay awake  but it got better as time went on. Tests were easy if you paid attention  and is very humorous. One of the negatives is that you now have to pay for the course packet  but overall great.
3.5,I absolutely LOVED him! He made his lectures interesting  and I actually looked forward to going to class. He made a booklet of all the study guides and lecture outlines for us to take notes on  all you had to do was go to CopyWorks and buy it. There were a few videos  but mostly lecture information was on tests.
3.5,He's a nice guy  but very boring lectures. I have zoned out so many times. Tests are pretty tough. He does give you a study guide though. Lecture every class. Quizzes on short books and tests over a few weeks of material.
3.5,Sadkowski is pretty cool. He likes to lecture a lot  but does include some discussion and movies. His tests are difficult  but he gave us all of our study guides on the first day. His papers are demanding though.
4,Took him for my capstone. You have to buy and read several books.Grading goes as follows:attendance participation  3 exams(each exam is a essay/paper).Expect to write 3 exams around 6 to 10 pages each.Lectures are long and boing.If you read and participate-you will do fine.He is a nice guy.Not tech-savy so no powerpoints. Take notes. Good Luck!
1,boring lectures  not direct  rambles  unorganized  time better used on reading textbook and studying. Material on tests aren't always covered in lecture/textbook/study guides. hard to know something when you're not told about it..take a different teacher  he's a nice funny old guy  but needs to update/review methods of his lecturing cause they suck
4,Let's be real here  people who rate professors poorly were probably poor students to being with. His classes are easily understood and you'll do just fine if you take notes and participate in class  like you should in any class. He's a nice guy and will answer your questions if you need help and hands out a guide at the start of class.
1.5,Didn't give the course packet to us at all  so it was very difficult. No powerpoints so you have to write everything down from what he speaks. You'll miss things. Tests are hard. No homework.
4,Show up to class and take notes and you will have no problem passing this class.
4.5,He gives you all of the notes in a coursepack at the start of the semester and attendence isn't required  but he will bump up your grade if you're there frequently enough for him to recognize your name. The tests come directly from the study guides he gives you  and all of the answers are in the course pack. Very good prof and easy class!
4,You must attend class or you will miss something you need to know for the test. He just talks at you the entire time. Try to keep up with notes and start studying days in advance for the test. Use the study guide  very helpful. If i were you id get a different teacher.
3.5,Contrary to what you might have read  this is an awesome class. If you love history then you will get tons from this professor. Tests are difficult but that is made up for with the curve. Off topic discussions started to revamp the class. There was so much I thought I new before this class  but I learned more than I ever thought I could.
1,He had terrible handwriting  wasn't organized and skipped around in lectures. His tests were AWFUL even though he had a study guide  half of it wasn't on the test and you had no idea what to expect. He was always late to class and just NOT GOOD.
3,Peters was good but the class was a lot of work. For an LAC class  I spent more time doing tests and homework than for my major classes. There are 6 tests and they are all online (30-40 MC with a strict time limit)  but the final is in class (100 multiple choice). There are also 4 article reflections throughout the semester that took a lot of time.
5,There are a lot of readings outside of class but he covers the main ideas in lecture well. Papers are pretty big but manageable and he leaves feedback in a timely fashion. I feel like I learned a lot in both Law and the Courts and Law and Politics and would definitely recommend those classes.
2,Only grades are papers and exams  he is a tough grader! You have an extra credit opportunity where you can type three papers  but you can only get a total of ONE combined. All tests are on quizlet but you only get 40 minutes for 40 questions. I thought the class was super boring. You have a total of 6 papers. Attendance is required.
5,FYI Professor Scott Peters is listed on MyUniverse as Christopher S Peters. Dr. Peters has been an amazing professor for every class I have taken with him. He is so knowledgable on our county's courts system  and he is so good at teaching in a way that is understandable to those with no knowledge of law or politics. Highly recommend this professor!
5,Peters is a really great professor. This is the 3rd or 4th class I've taken with him  and he always has very clear grading criteria  clear explanations during class  and a real passion for what he does. He's extremely knowledgeable  but if he doesn't know the answer to a question you have  he'll take time to find it for you. Excellent guy!
5,Whole outline of class is done by working in groups. Very very little class time spent on lecturing and more focused on working at your respective groups. He's extremely intelligent and further sparked a passion in politics for me. Don't take if you're wanting an easy class. He makes you work for it.
4.5,Professor Peters is a good teacher. He is passionate about politics and has interesting class discussions. His lectures can get long and boring. He does a good job of not letting his personal views get in the way of his teaching. His quizzes can be difficult and he can be a tough grader. You definitely have to work for your grade.
5,Dr. Peters is great - he's a tough grader  and you have several shortish papers  but the lectures are always engaging  and often entertaining. He's very clear in grading  so there are no surprises when it comes to that.
3,Class consists of six exams and two papers. Hefty reading assignments and no break between exams. Tests are online but are very difficult. Final is cumulative. One of my favorite professors on campus and one of my fav classes. Wish I could take more classes with him.
3.5,He was a pretty good teacher. The tests are a little difficult  but if you show up to class and take notes you will be fine. Really smart guy.
4,Dr. Peters does a great job keeping his political affiliation out of his lectures. His class is not easy but he is a really nice guy and helps you succeed. All his exams are online (6 of them) and there is a cumulative in class final (based off previous exam Q's). The online exams are tough but it is not to tough to get B- or B. Tough to get an A.
3.5,Attendance counts for points. I finished the class with 89.99% but he gave me an A- cause I was always there and participated. Four papers  six tests (online). Cumulative final. Tests can be kinda vague  so definitely study. Textbook really comes in handy. Dr. Peters is a really nice guy and a decent professor.
5,Dr. Peters is the type of professor every prof should strive to be. He exudes passion for his material and for student success. Yes  his class is difficult  but you learn so much. And  if I'm going to go into debt  I want to LEARN. I also might add the difficulty has nothing to do with lack of clarity or lack of helpfulness.
4.5,Almost impossible to get an A
2.5,Dr. Peters is very smart and interested in student learning. structure of the class wasn't lecture the whole time and we got freedom to work at our own pace. He has you do a ton of readings at the beginning of the semester though and gets pretty mad if you don't do them. He's a good professor but pretty hard  especially for a lower level class.
4.5,He's a very wise guy with a lot of studying not only on his teaching area but in general. Will make you study a lot and lots of non related readings. Exams are easy as long as you do the study guide  will make you work hard for your grade  but if learning is your thing it should be worth it.
4,Peters was a tough professor. He assigned lots of textbook readings  along with supplementary materials every class period. He has pretty open office hours though & really knows his stuff. His class's definitely passable  but he's a teacher that makes you work for your grade & legitimately wants his students to learn  no matter how rough it may be.
3,I personally cannot stand Peters. I had him for 5 classes because of my minor. He is very intelligent  and knows his stuff  however his grading standards are ridiculous and as a person he's a little arrogant.
3.5,Peters is a nice guy  his office is open a lot if you need to ask questions. His classes involve a lot of reading  lectures almost everyday  a short paper  a research paper  and about 3 exams which are challenging but not impossible.
3.5,Very good teacher. Knows his stuff. Must show up to class. Don't be late  he's not fond of that. If you're going to miss a class  let him know. Uses email ALOT so check it often. Definitely do the readings or you'll be lost in class.
2,Extremely nice prof who knows what he is talking about but not an organized or interesting class. I was excited because I have an interest in astronomy but the class is completely dull and a bit of a downer. The assignment are tedious and do not promote learning at all. The testing is adequate if you have time to read the entire textbook.
4.5,As an arts student with terrible math skills trying to fit in with honors physics students  professor Tindall did an awesome job helping me out and explaining things in ways that were alternative to the textbook. Yes  he may not be the young hot-shot that buffs himself as the most contemporary astro-physicist  but he's a great professor.
4.5,You can tell he loves the material  and it is boring sometimes  but this class was definitely really cool. He made the tests SO EASY  you get a cheat sheet for every one  so theres no way to NOT get a good mark. He takes test material right out of the book and only does more challenging math on assignments  which he will help you do if you ask.
2,David Tindall is a very nice prof and tries to help but I feel that this course - 2451 - is way beneath what he knows
1,HORRIBLE!! run away  NOW! Worst prof and class ever. I thought it would be really interesting but I was wrong. I never thought it was possible to make something so boring.
3,This class was brutal! The tests were so unrelated to the lectures and the assignments were all math. He didn't give examples  and classes were a waste of time. He was good at answering his email  but spent way too much time talking about his e-mail list in class too and meetings.
1.5,I was really excited to take this course but it didn't live up to my hopes. The prof is obviously interested in what he's doing but he doesn't succeed in making lectures interesting at all. Those who attend usually sleep. And the tests are not related to lecture material.
3,His tests are brutal! There is no point even going to class  he just picks the most obscure facts from the book and makes a test out of them.
1.5,class gave me nightmares of the laurencetown beach
3,Hard to follow sometimes  but he's always willing to help as best he can.
2.5,"""For the question J^j  to find the cost is like to find the dampning of the water waves or in an engine oscillating motion."" To sum things up  he is rarely on track with what he is doing"
3,this teacher is very nice but she is very hard to understand the whole class felt like a huge waste of time. i can truly say i didnt learn one thing knew from her. the class really felt like she let students teach more then she did. lots of test with very little extra points. also lots of random papers online you have to do. i would never pick her
2,HORRIBLE. SO MANY PAPERS. SHE IS A TOUGH GRADER! At least 5-8 papers due EVERY SINGLE WEEK! I'm not sure if it is different in-class but I will never do this again.
1,Lot of writing  but I'm fine with that. Great textbook choice. Test match the coursework covered. The issue is if you don't regurgitate the views she shares (not the text or material) the way that she wants  your grade will suffer.
1,I could tell she loves her subject but she is a bit scattered and that makes it hard to learn from her. I enjoyed being in this class because of the classroom discussion but her lack of preparation is hard to learn anything from her. So if you take her GET THE BOOK!!!! READ THE BOOK!!!!! Do those 2 things and you will be fine.
5,A lot of assignments. Clear guidelines  fair grading  answers emails quickly. Surprised by the bad feedback.
2,Please avoid this professor at all costs. I took this class online and every week I had written 6-10 pages of research work just to pass. She takes off for idiotic things and doesn't help you what so ever. Please avoid taking this class with her online. It is almost impossible to keep your sanity.
2,I toke her class online. Most of the material I learned was from the text book. Be sure to underline important sentences and paragraphs. You will also need to write a lot  at least 2 1/2 to 5 or 6 pages per each essay assignment. There are two essay assighnments due each week. Follow my guideline and you will get an A in the class  just like I did.
4,I think that she is a great teacher. If you are haveing issues in her class all you have to do is talk to her and she will help you out. She will not fail you if you try in her class.
1,This is by far the worst teacher I have ever taken. The only advice I can give is DO NOT TAKE THIS LADY!!!! She asks questions in one way and grades how she wants. She asks an opinion question and wants your answers backed up with research.
1.5,What I don't understand is how she is the chair of the department and still be the worst professor? Students have been saying she is horrible for years and she still has her job. I don't understand that. I guess the college and division don't care how bad she is at teaching. Someone else should be evaluating her besides her dept.
1,She is the worst teacher I have ever had. Everything people say on here is true. I wish I would have never taken her class.
1.5,"Took this class online- and I have taken online classes many times before. By far  this is the least helpful professor I have ever had. If you ask questions  she treats it like it's a nuisance. Gives vague instructions- and then takes off major points for not ""understanding"" what was being asked. Would not recommend her."
2,"Her usual feedback for discussions and essays are ""ok"". What kind of feedback is that? Takes off points but not explain why  thats not helpful. She is a hard teacher and a there is a lot of reading and writing plus some questions on exams are from the next chapter or not at all in the book."
1,(online) Her directions are clear as mud. She counts off for seemingly random things with no explanation or prior warning. Does not respond to questions and is very rude if she responds to anything. This course was insanely writing intensive (2 essays a week) and the tests were over unimportant details or not in the book at all. Avoid at all costs!
1,This is by far the worst instructor I have ever had. She takes for ever to grade assignments but yet she never takes the time to correct her typos. It's like she leaves them on purpose. Her tests are really hard and most of the things she tests you over are not in the book or lectures.
1.5,Dona Fletcher grades unfairly. She is closed-minded & isnt willing to accept differing views. I found her docking me points undeservedly. She has a discouraging teaching style & all-around professing for the wrong reasons
2.5,"I feel bad here  but all I can say about the online class I took with her is ""third time is a charm""....Partly my fault for not studying as much as I should have..But she wasn't all that helpful either..."
1,Dont take any of her classes!!
3,When you write out an answer to a question on her tests please write an eassy. You will get an F if you do not do that. Why is she the head of the Sociology/Social Work/Geography Department in the first place? There are many other qualified Professors that should have that position.
1,Recommend not to take her. It takes forever to get grades back and you can forget about e-mailing her  sometimes she never replied back. Very rude and unorganized.
3.5,Don is very much what you will find in the industry. Very much ego driven. If you aren't in his click  you'll know it. I believe Don is a good teacher. But  what he taught was sometimes wrong and overall  didn't cover what I needed to enter into the real world of production. If you can conquer Don  you'll do well in the industry.
1.5,This guy is so into himself and thinks hes tough stuff. If you dont get involved 100% and go on remotes you are not liked. Favorites are clear in his classes.
5,Excellent man.
5,I enjoyed his class  very clear  gives a lot of examples to better understand
3,wow. this class was challenging and redirected my focus on the future. and the briefs we prepared were key in learning how to communicate the essentials of a msg concisely. wtg  boggs!
5,Comm Law is probably one of the toughest non-science classes at AU. It was hard  but enjoyable. Some find Dr. Boggs hard for classes  but I've always thought he's one of the wisest and best profs at AU.
5,Professor Bloom is the best. He's so helpful and wonderful. He's the most approachable professor I've ever had at Smith. I highly recommend his courses. He's also a fairly generous grader. And he's adorable!
5,Almost 40 years later  I remember Peter Bloom for inspiring me to become a scholar. Peter taught me the joy of reading critically  writing well  and thinking logically. He changed my life  and I am grateful.
3.5,The class curriculum is very interesting  but I wouldn't say he teaches in the best way. He talks to his classes as if he's a parent lecturing to a thirteen-year-old. He's the type of professor who always thinks he is right  so he is very critical of his students' work.
4.5,Peter Bloom is one of the hardest graders in the music department  but a fantastic professor. The exams are based mostly on listening so it is much more difficult for nonmusicians. It is important to ask questions  challenge him  and go above and beyond for his class. Music Majors should take a class from him before graduating.
5,He is one of the most intelligent and well-informed (and not just about his subject matter) people I have ever learned from. I think his class is extremely informative on the subject of music (and world politics and history). Yes  his listening exams are hard  but as long as you study for them well  you will do fine. This class is worth it!
5,People make Peter Bloom sound like the most inhumane pompous person ever to inhabit the planet. But he's really an excellent professor. I have learned more from his classes than any other classes I've taken here. Even his tangents are informative. Take his seminars  they're worth it.
3.5,While much more cantankerous and demanding than most professors  Professor Bloom retains an incredible degree of integrity. It took me a good seventy percent of the semester to warm up to him  but venerable and somewhat-scary character that he is  I hold him in the highest esteem.
2,Prof. Bloom is a brilliant but arrogant man that will not hesitate to make fun of anyone in order to make himself look better. Be careful as you can learn a lot from his classes  but can get a lot of grief from them as a result of his perfectionism and high handed manner as well.
2.5,Although you learn a lot in his course  there is just way to much music to memorize for his listening exams. He expects you to know a great deal about music coming into the class  which not only means being able to read music  but also to be able to easily explain synphonies  string quartets operas 
1,The tests and papers are largely based solely on reading and outside work. I could do as well on them not having ever gone to class  and I got a B+ in the class. Hes mean  unhelpful  plays favorites  and spends too much time talking about france.
5,Really tough class but you will learn a lot. He's really funny too.
2.5,No Comments
2.5,This class is a ton of work  and the exams and papers are bad (his exams are hard  the papers are easy but graded harshly). He really knows his stuff  but he's a little unrealistic when it comes to his students. He also plays favorites.
2.5,No Comments
4,I loved Dr. Grabe's telecom class. She really knows all of her stuff and I found her lectures interesting and at times very enjoyable. She uses a lot of examples and often asks for people to participate and I often felt bad because hardly anyone beyond the same few would participate. She's really cheerful and has a great sense of humor!
2,Her lectures are extremely boring and a lot of the things on the tests are from the lectures. She uses the entire hour and 15 minutes every class. I recommend attending every class  but after the 3rd week you will start to question why you are attending.
5,Awesome professor  really tries to get you to think. The tests can be a bit tricky but if you show up  listen to what she says  skim the readings  and do the assignments you should be golden. The topic is interesting and she teaches it well. Highly recommended!
3,Lectures were interesting but class was harder than it needed to be. There were exam questions from the textbook about things that were never discussed in class. The grading system was unfair for the papers as points were taken off for no reason  making it hard to get the grades you deserved.
1,Do not take her for any classes. She is terrible with handling grades and getting papers back on time. She is very unorganized  and rude when people go against her perception of what is right. URGE you to take someone else!
3,Lectures are interesting  but she can be very close-minded. You need to go to class every day  no exceptions  you'll miss too much. Grading for papers is mostly fair  but can be fairly arbitrary at times. The tests are multiple choice  but with short answer type questions  which makes them tricky and sometimes potentially wrong.
5,"I am now in the ""real world"" of journalism  and I credit her for helping me build the right skills and encouraging me to see that I can be successful in a tough business (I say this 3 yrs later). She is tough  but it's worth it. I'm not sure how she is in telecom  but if it's similar at all  take the class!"
2,the assignments were extremely easy but she tried to trick you for the tests which made them impossible!
3,Very hard class. She's organized  posts helpful class notes. Tests are hard. She finds a way to trick you. Assignments aren't that hard  but the TA's take off points for no reason and all those missed points really add up. Not many people get A's. Although she uses videos as examples alot  I find myself staring at the clock the whole time.
3.5,This class is highly recommended. The tests are FAIR  so GO TO CLASS and STUDY. She is a good teacher and uses a lot of video/image examples. Just hope that the AI grading your papers is Fair as well.
4.5,Although she is a very difficult teacher  she is always there to help. She is one of my favorite professors I have had. Highly recommend as long as you are prepared to attend class!
5,Honest to God  she's the best Prof. I've had. Very intelligent and extremely helpful - you can't help but like her.
3,Class lectures were interesting at times...she seems like a nice woman. Her tests can be kind of difficult and she is rather strict with the grading of assignments. Just make sure you go to every class and take notes during the lectures and you'll be fine for exams.
3,class is pretty interesting but can be pretty boring...tests are pretty hard!
2,This professor is very knowledgeable and her tests in J210 were cake  but she was very rude to me and other students. She promotes class conflict and makes assignments more difficult than they need to be. Her personality is very abrasive.
1,"This class is completely subjective and she teaches it very unfairly. She let half the class have cameras for a week longer than the rest of our class and still considers it to be a ""fair"" assignment. She told us to pretend it was like ""Survivor""  sorry but I don't remember signing up for a tv show at registration..."
1.5,Hard Grader and went to all lectures studyed all notes and materials given and failed the mid term...ended up dropping class
5,A superb journalist and person. Excellent writing skills  she will force you to think of a million different methods to convey a thought. It doesn't matter if you want to be in front of the camera or behind it  she will support you 100 percent.
1.5,No Comments
5,Took 2 of her courses in Broadcast Journalism track. Loved her. Challenging. Prepared me for the real world of journalism.
5,This is the second class I've taken with Dr. P  and she never disappoints. For someone who is enormously busy and hugely respected in her field  Dr. P always comes prepared to class  always has excellent feedback and knowledge to impart  and always makes class engaging. If you do the reading (there's a lot)  you'll learn so much. Highly recommend.
4,Radhika is intelligent  charismatic  and tough. She'll push you to think about race and gender in a new way  and she'll push you to do the work. This is not a class you can skate by in without doing the reading  but putting in the effort is worth it. She's a great instructor  and the class is enlightening and entertaining. Highly recommend.
4.5,One of the best classes I have taken at IU and that is because Professor Parameswaran was so fantastic. The nature of the course is interesting so that really helps when there is a lot of reading assigned. Prof. P. makes you work for your grade  but she is very genuine and is one of the best personalities of the IU Journalism faculty.
1,Radhika is by far one of the worst teacher I have ever had. You MUST attend class everyday to take the participation assignments that are REALLY hard! The exams are impossible because they are completely based on the articles/textbook readings which are 30+ pages per night). DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!
1,"She is one of the hardest graders ever. She makes fun of the journalism degree constantly and says that she's going to make us work ""twice as hard"" when we come to her class. Her assignments are ridiculous and she makes it very difficult to have a good grade in the class without staying up all night to finish her assignments."
1,Her lectures are NOT interesting at all and the material on the exams is all based on the textbook readings (which are easily multiple chapters  and multiple articles per night). She is useless when it comes to help and she's unforgiving about students specific situations. The inclass assignments are like mini tests.DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HER!
4.5,She's very helpful and her class is interesting. You have to read a lot but it's a research course so you kind of have to figure that. Fun teacher though.
4.5,Awesome professor. Intelligent  lively  funny  enthusiastic. Do the readings or you will be screwed at the end of the semester. Be active in class. Ask questions if you need help. She's a hard grader and her tests are tough- if you pay attention in class and do assignments you'll be fine. One of my fave classes at IU
3.5,have to do readings every time they are assigned. on tests she is SO specific. if you dont say what shes looking for its wrong. have to work veryyy hard
4,"She gives extremely thought-provoking lectures  and is great at sparking discussion. However  I can't say I learned anything new  mostly we discussed current events. Worse  she encourages ""creativity"" on papers  but in grading them  she just wants students to spit back the reading. And there's way  way too much reading. Class=fun  homework load=bad"
1,help
5,Great professor  she did not say we should not critique the readings  just asked us to do it respectfully.
5,She is passionate about her subject and it comes through in her teaching. Breaking down readings in class  encouraging students to voice their interpretations  giving clear instructions and guidance on her expectations for each assignment are just some of her strong points. Fab professor  approachable  great sense of humor. Prof Parameswaran rocks!
1,She is so full of herself and PATHETIC. Prof. P stands for Pathetic and Positively ghastly. DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS. She has no substance and you don't learn a single thing in this class.
5,Prof P is the best! To those who said she was biased: She's only biased against people who don't care about the class/don't show up. I wouldn't recommend the class to people who aren't interested in advertising or people looking for an easy A. But if you show up  hand in decent work and participate she's a great Prof and you will do well!
2,Bad Class  final study guide is more than 40 pages  books are dull. If you have no interest in race gender or media DONT TAKE.
5,Great class!! Radhika is fantastic. She has great energy and is brilliant ...but not condescending
1,Oh God! She is aweful and biased. Don't ever take her class unless its the last class on earth and you have no other choice. even then  it would be better without HER class.
5,Prof. P is the best professor I have ever had. She is so helpful and you can definitely tell that she loves her students and her job. Make sure you take at least one class with her!!!
4.5,Radhika is awesome. She is one of my favorite profs at the j school. Definately take Race Gender and the Media. It should be required.
4,Good teacher!!
5,Dr. Farrer is by far my FAVORITE professor at Cal. She will help you with ANYTHING. She really is there to help you succeed. Her class is a lot of work  but if you do the work you'll get an A. She is very organized and her class is fun! Take Dr. Farrer's class if you can!!!!
5,Wonderful techer! She makes learning fun. I wish she taught all of the education classes at Cal. She truly loves teaching and will remind you every day why you are in school for education. Wonderful wonderful lady!!
5,Great teacher  she was helpful and do anything to help a studnet understand an assignment. Loved the class and would recomend her for any course.
5,Extremely nice teacher. She is excited to teach and will help you with any questions you have. The class is really easy as long as you go and turn your work in. I didn't use the textbook much-her powerpoints are wonderful.
5,What a wonderful lady! VERY EXCITED to teach and be there  which is sometimes hard to find with professors these days. Cares about her students doing well and will help at any cost.
5,Awesome professor. Pay attention in class  do the assignments  and you will learn a lot AND get an A.
5,Dr. Farrer is the BEST professor at Cal. I highly recommend taking any course you can with her. She is very thorough and clear with what she expects. Excellent experience.
5,I took an online course from Dr. Farrer. I learned a lot and she is very helpful. I am working on a Master's and would definitely recommend this program to my friends.
5,Dr. Farrer is excellent and her enthusiasm is contagious!
5,Dr. Farrer is a terrific teacher! She cares about her students  and wants them to do well. She teaches the material in the class very well and in a way which most to all of her student grasps and understand it. I would recommend taking Dr. Farrer in all the classes you can.
5,Amazing professor. She is concerned with helping you learn how to be a great  not bogging you down with busy work. Always there to help you out with anything. Complete assignments and go to class and it is an easy A.
5,Great professor. Easy grader. Always willing to help. A's are very easy to attain.
5,The best teacher I had so far at Cal! Very involved with her students success and very easy to talk to.
5,Dr. Farrer is the best professor I've had so far here at Cal. She is all about student success. She will bend over backwards to help you in any way she can. Wonderful teacher. The class can be very repetitive esp. if you have the intro class too. Just go to class and you'll be guarenteed an A. =)
5,Dr. Farrer is a great teacher and really cares about her students. Attendance is not mandatory however if you miss three or more classes 15 points will be lost from your final grade. Class is easy and the teacher is great!
5,One of the best professors you will every have. Organized and fun  will listen and help you understand. I recommend you take her for any class she teaches. You will learn.
5,Dr. Farrer is by far the greatest professor at Cal. She is organized and clear which are great attributes to model to future teachers. She was my absolute favorite.
5,Great teacher. Enjoy every class. Learned lots!!!!!!
5,She was a great teacher & the class was so much fun! I learned alot & actually wanted 2 go 2 my 8am class. There is alot of work but its so much fun & u will b so happy w/ the final project @ the end. She is so helpful & she prepares u 4 the 2 tests she gives in class. Show up 4 class & u'll get over 100%!!! I loved this class & her!
1,Worst professor I have ever had. Lectures jump from topic to topic  it's hard to follow his train of thought. Type of professor that somehow is convinced that the shape of the letter G has to do with some deep meaning in the text and the author definitely meant to do that... no. Sitting in class right now with him ridiculously annoyed.
2,His lectures were very confusing. He pretty much talked and occasionally wrote words on the board. You can get by without doing much of the reading and it was an easy B+.
4,Great Professor. Essays and tests are straight forward. Good class for people who do not want to participate because it does not count.
2,Professor Fogel is a very nice and smart man  but he is extremely confusing as a lecturer. We constantly skipped around in every book we read  which made it very difficult to understand what was going on. He is available for help  but his explanations or answers to questions are often confusing. Grading is pretty fair.
4.5,Professor Fogel is simply the greatest. He is so incredibly knowledgeable  but not intimidating at all. He is super-helpful during office hours and in e-mails and is always willing to meet with students even if it means coming outside his office hours. He is tough  but so open to hearing other students' ideas. So glad I took his class!
3.5,Professor Fogel is my favorite! He's so interesting and funny. He's also sort of an old hipster prof  which is kind of funny. At first I was thinking about switching out of his class because he mumbled so much and acted so nervous on the first day  but I'm glad I did it. His grading isn't too hard  and the reading is pretty light. Take his class!
4,Such an insightful  hilarious man! At first I was put off my his mumbling ways  but trust me  once you get to know him  all his interests  manners  tastes  asides  and honest skill as a professor become entirely endearing. Helped me to look at poetry in a new way.
4.5,I had Fogel back in the mid 80's  and he sounds like he's still the same guy: funny  encouraging  remarkably insightful  and sparks insights into lit that I never had from any other prof before or since. Run  don't walk  to be in one of his classes.
3.5,Ive taken Fogel twice-- you gotta love him. He'll get so excited about lines or words in poems and tell us his theory about them that will take up a third of the class. Always makes jokes about having read things over and over for 30 years. Come up with an interesting new idea about a poem or book and if he gets it in any way he'll appreciate it.
4.5,Has been teaching English for 30 years. Loves lit
3.5,Staggeringly intelligent  very funny and kind  Professor Fogel is wonderful  albeit very scatterbrained. His grading varies from fair to hard
4.5,Words cannot describe the love that I have for this man-he is MY hobby-horse. But seriously- his methods of teaching are extremely sophisticated and innovative  and I recommend him to anyone who seeks alternative teaching methods  especially in English.
4.5,This man is a genius. Plain and simple.
4.5,I wish that I could have only him as a professor for the rest of my life. He is so wonderful and encouraging  and he doesn't force you to speak if you don't want to. Incredibly intelligent and nice  and he deserves some sort of award (or at least a raise!)
4,asks relevant questions about the text
4.5,Took him for HU221 and EN536 American Poetry. Hands down my favorite English Professor at BU. Basically a genius and such a kind  humble  and funny person. Take his courses if you love to close read. He really gives you the freedom to offer interesting  off-the-wall readings. Basically  can't say enough. Take his classes.
5,He's an incredible professor. Modern British Novel was my favorite part of Tuesdays and Thursdays. The material is difficult  but Prof. Fogel is very encouraging and helpful. In addition he's probably the funniest professor I've encountered. His mind seems to work at lightspeed.
1.5,No Comments
5,Passionate  funny  and very clear in advice on how to improve both writing and comprehension!
2.5,Loved him in HU 221  but his modern lit class was the worst nightmare of my senior year. He was unclear in giving paper topics then would complain later and make you rewrite the paper...argh  it was so frustrating!!!
1,DONT TAKE HER. She is extremely unprofessional  talks about personal life in class A LOT yet still expects you to somehow learn materials and take tests on them. Basically a huge waste of time and money. Tests are confusing and unclear  will tell you you're wrong when you question her. Have to teach yourself basically.
3,Dr. P is an odd character but overall Psych of Women is very easy. The class consists of 3 or 4 take home exams  and no homework or quizzes (very easy). She will go off on a tangent for hours if you let her.
3,easy A for sure  administered the wrong exam twice to us. still made us take the correct exams. I'm sure she lost exam 2 because we still haven't received our grades & the semester is about to end. Gets off topic  definitely didn't feel like a 400 level course. She is a nice lady and accepts late work. 4 Exams
1,Absolutely horrible. Does NOT teach at all. Class is a waste of time. She just reads the powerpoints out loud to the class. Never learned anything from her  just taught myself everything with the book. If you read the book you'll be fine for the exams. /If you can avoid taking her then do  bc social psychology is very interesting  just not with her
2,I didn't buy the book because she wasn't here for the first week of classes. Ended up with a B- and I don't normally get B's. She does not teach  she reads. 4 tests  all multiple choice. Last 2 tests she gave study guides because no one was passing. She's pretty out-there and rambles a lot. May have done better if I bought the book but unnecessary.
2,She is a great person  funny and personable. But  she can't teach. You'll be happy if it's just a ge class  but if you're a psych major you'll be disappointed about how much you don't learn. It's an easy A though.
1,Dr. Perdue is the worst professor i have ever had. She does not teach well  at all. The only grades you get for the class are 4 exams (including the final) and the wording of the exams is difficult to understand. Very awkward teacher and she doesn't care about the students. SWITCH IF YOU CAN!!!!!
1,AVOID HER. doesn't teach at all  only gives 3-4 tests that are multiple choice  the only way you'll pass those is by reading the book because she doesnt make powerpoints or write notes. rambles a lot  class drags. withdrew out of this class  never taking a class with her again.
1,Worst professor at CCSU. Avoid her if you can because you won't learn.
1,Worst professor at CCSU. Avoid her if you can.
2,"I honestly have trouble coming up with how to describe her as a professor. She's disorganized  off-topic  irrelevant  and even contradicted the assigned textbook material often enough for it to be an issue. However  I barely showed up to class  never bought the book  took all her tests at the end of the semester (she allows ""makeups"") and got an A."
2.5,I was so hot and cold with this class. There were some days where she actually taught the material and other days where she just rambled on about nothing and made me wish I'd have stayed home in bed. She can be pretty funny and sometimes her lectures were interesting.
1,Dr. Perdue has her good moments but I would avoid her if you have the chance! She is super opinionated and shoots down others opinions before they even try to share. Very intimidating  does not like to answer many questions and rarely answers emails. She does allow for make up exams. The study guides she gives don't help much. Read the book!
1,This professor is not clear about her expectations AT ALL. All of her exams are take home and you will not learn anything about the material in class. Use the book to find the answers. She clearly hates men and fights stereotypes about women using stereotypes about men. Avoid this professor at all costs. She is petty and spiteful in her grading.
2.5,"She is the least conventional professor I have ever had. She is fearless in sharing her opinions and experiences. She's an incredible person to learn from. If you're a young woman looking to be inspired to ""stick it to the man""  take this class. Not a hard class if you can articulate your opinions and are a good reader."
5,Very easy class. Attendance is not mandatory but if you sit in the front row and are absent she will remember your face and wonder where you are. She's very accommodating to those with disabilities. Gives a make up exam session at the end if you miss the one in class. Get ready to hear about her own sex life..
2,"If you have a choice  do not take her. People say she is ""honest"" but it's more like disrespectful. Its her opinion or nothing. Her tests aren't easy and I end up teaching myself because she talks in class instead of teaching. She does have makeups if you miss the test though. attendance is not mandatory. I never look forward to this class. :("
5,Dr. Perdue is a real person. Very honest and interested in making sure you understand that life outside the classroom isn't gum drops and lollipops. I love her grit and her approachability. She gives many first hand examples and her laugh may startle you  but she is fabulous. A very very smart Professor.
3.5,I took her for social psychology she is sweet and outgoing. she'll help you a lot if you need it  but get ready for a weird  but awesome teacher her class is easy i barely opened my text book. whatever she goes over in class is on her tests and she'll let you know whats on it the class before. TAKE HER!!!!
4.5,Great teacher that makes you actually think  not only about the lecture but about what's going on in our society and the world. Can be a bit boisterous at times but I think she's doing so to get people's attention.Come to class  take notes  read the text  you'll walk away learning alot.
2,Dr. Hadley is a teacher of the past. Students can learn a lot from him  if they overlook his nastiness (which occurs a lot). He expects a lot from you  and he wants you to expect more from yourself. He is also getting older  so that is why he sometimes seems forgetful. Overall  a wonderful and funny man  who has an incredible amount of knowledge to offer.
3.5,Hadley could be harsh  but you just have to take it in stride. He's an old man who knows by now that not everyone is going to like him  so he doesn't try to be the favorite professor. You don't have to be a drama major to make him like you
5,"I think Dr. Hadley is an amazing person and an amazing professor. I was neither a theater major nor did I make him food  and he liked me! I found in my experiences that the students who disliked him really were ""the idiots."" After my undergrad and master's degree  I have yet to know another professor with such balanced knowledge AND experience."
4,Dr. Hadley can be an aquired taste. A lot of what he says  he doesn't mean  all you have to do to get decent grades in his class is do do your homework and participate. And he's right though  as a generation we know a lot about technology but not a lot about world affairs.
1,Hadley is very mean  and a very unclear professor. Needs to work on his people skills  although he *should* have them figured out by now. Will NOT like you in class unless you're a DRAMA/THEATRE major  be forewarned.

1,This man is horrible  she should be fired and put in a mental ward. Me talks about how me knows so many famous people but beyond that he is a nobody as far as I am concerned. His tests make no since  you have to make him food to get a good grade!
2.5,Dr. Hadley can be downright mean. He once called our entire class idiots. In short  I did not enjoy being in his class  although I did well.
1,Dr. Koury used to be my advisor. Then he was promoted and never told me he was no longer my advisor. I went a whole semester with no advisor and never even knew it because he never returned calls or emails and never had time to meet me. When I did speak to him  he was rude and lazy and knew nothing about anything. He is a waste of space. Avoid him.
2,wow... I'm not sure that there was even a teacher in the room most of the time. really off track this semester... would have rather had seman and learned something
2,I agree...he's nice but I'm constantly lost.
2,he's a really nice guy  but the class is often unclear of his expectations and requirements...If you love suspense and want to be left guessing the whole semester  he is your guy
5,Very nice guy  good sense of humor  very helpful
4.5,He is in my opinion one of the better professors on this campus. He is also a pretty easy going and funny guy.
5,No Comments
5,VERY EASY!!!! and nice to look at.
3.5,Try having a Physics Professor as a father. #HighExpectations You must go to class. Read the text. YouTube for more clarity and then Ask questions and go to office hours. Yup  that's my dad. Lol.
2,Dr. Garner is so unorganized! When teaching  he writes all over the board with arrows everywhere and so unclear to read. Do not take him whatever you do. And the tests are difficult.
2,"Intro. Physics teacher.Did not like this class at all. He was a nice guy and he obviously knew the material but could not teach it to students. He assumed you would just ""get it"" after a practically no explanation. Try to avoid."
3.5,he's a great guy a nice teacher and his class is kinda easy if you take notes and read the book.. i took him for lab and it was really easy as far as for lecture he's really nice and will take time to help you out of class but he is a theorist and most of the answers for the homework in the book he made are wrong  very unorganized.
1.5,He's difficult to understand and he wrote the text so the book becomes useless as well. Tests are hard  attendance is needed to get a grade for clicker problems  and homework tends to be complicated as well. It's difficult to know your grade  thus my entire class was left wondering whether or not we were passing with an A or completely failing.
4.5,Good guy. A lot of people don't like him but I think they are bl
4.5,Good guy. A lot of people don't like him but I think they are bl
2.5,Class is very stressfull! Luckily he curves his grading scale and I somehow managed a B-. Too often the questions on the exams were nowhere in the book or notes we took. I would stray away from this professor if possible.
1,if you have to take intro to physics  take it at FCCJ. basically  do NOT take garner for intro to physics  he is horrible. the worst professor i've ever had.
1.5,Very inconsistent and unclear. Adds unnecessary things that trip you up. Very intelligent man  horrible professor. Writes his own textbook for Intro physics  basically useless. Maybe he's not used to teaching introductory courses???? Do not take him for intro to physics.
1,Most definetly the worst professor I've ever had. I am a straight A science student and failed the first test. The book is impossible to follow (he wrote it) and is littered with mistakes. He treats intro physics students as if they've had physics before. I can usually learn from the text if the professor is horrible but he wrote the book  too.
1,Dr. Garner is by far the worst prof. ive ever had. His notes in class are pointless because all he does is prove 2 or 3 equations and where the equations came from  then be able to work complex problems with little examples. He doesnt care about his students at all. We started the class with 100 plus students and today in the final there was 50.
2,Lectures are pretty well organized  but he feels like he must prove every formula. Tests and quizzes are similar to examples and homework. Gives extra credit on Friday classes for attendance sometimes. Not a bad class if you study
4.5,He's a pretty good lecturer. His lectures are organized and straight forward. His quizzes are pretty much like the homework problem he assigns. The exams are mostly multiple choice (w/one written prob.) and he gives you a formula sheet to use. I find it to be easy if you study the hw problems. He posts solutions online before the exam. GREAT PROF!!
1,"Wish he was a Gardener and not a Teacher. Must have trained Lev  cuz they both are the two worst professors i have ever had. I passed Calc 3 with a ""B""  so math isn't my problem. Bad Teacher. Some reason tests are scantron. It is a math class....how does that make sense...ah he is too lazy to grade"
2,nice guy  really loves physics  he tries hard but is not too good at explaining physics good enough for people to really understand it
1,The worst teacher I have ever had. He cannot explain how to do anything relevant. The main points that you need to know come after 40 minutes of nonsense proof. Do not take him for Calculus based Physics worst teaching job ever.
2,He makes it harder than it has to be. Course moves very quickly. The gradding scale is the only saving grace. 100-80 is an A  79-65 B  64-55 C  54-45 D. And he drops your lowest test and quiz grade. Seems ridiculous but you will need it  our class average on the last test was a 50%. Good Luck!
1,Dr. Garner has a God complex. I took him when it was still 3049 and he told us this class is too easy to be upper-level. I went to see him during office hours to discuss homework I couldn't complete. His advice? Do the homework.
3,Seems to have a hard time explaining physics  although he tries hard. I did think the tests were pretty fair though  I studied little and pulled off an A.
5,Great class  easy  but you do learn a lot both from the text and instructors experiences. Great guy and easy going but can put you to sleep sometimes......especially after a lunch at Speeds Deli....MMMMMmmmm Speeeeds...

5,Easiest professor I've ever had in my life. If you don't get an A in this class  you're an idiot. Exposed to a lot of great info  sometimes a little dull. EXTREMELY respectful and considerate of students.
3.5,One of the easiest teachers ever  with a goal of giving everybody an A. Also one of the nicest guys ever!
1.5,I have to agree the mid-80's vidoes suck and you can go maybe 1 time every two weeks and get an A all open book tests.... i didnt even read one newonce in the book and got a A. anyone need a highlighted book with test ?'s letme know
3,"This is one of the most retarded classes I've ever taken. Every single class has a video  and none of them are new than the mid-80's  most of them are terrible quality. Yet the tests are taken straight out of an outdated  redundant ""textbook"". Poor teacher."
5,What a cool teacher.This is one of the best teachers at this school.Easy but you learn A lot.
3,Too many videos  too much reading straight from book/slides.
4.5,Not a hand-holder for sure  but if Nodine causes you to have a mental breakdown  you probably need to reconsider your ambition to be an artist in a highly competitive and ambiguous field. She's tough but fair and does not cater to slackers or those who think they are special snowflakes. She ALWAYS helps those who work hard and have the guts to ask.
5,I had Dr. Nodine for Printmaking I  and while she nearly killed me in 3-D Design  she was AWESOME in this class! Have to work hard outside of class in order to finish your projects on time  but it's work you'll actually ENJOY. It's obvious Nodine adores teaching this class. Take this class if at all possible! Funnest art studio class I've ever had!
3,Very hard teacher  makes you work like a dog for a good grade. Very condescending and unclear. Got nicer and easier halfway through the class  but only because one of the students nearly had a mental breakdown. Last half of the semester was fun. I learned a lot but still  I don't recommend taking a class with her unless you absolutely have to.
1,I hated the course and the way the professor interacted with the students. I think she needs some people skills.
5,I adore Ms. Nodine. You earn whatever grade you get in her class  and if you are really trying you will be proud of what you create w/ her. She is always willing to help  don't be afraid to ask. I know she can seem a little intimidating at times  but look past that to one of the best professors and artist in the state.
2,I would tell you to avoid her at all costs  but if your major is art thats impossible. Just keep your contact down because she is a person who will treat you bad and then make you start to believe you can't do something.
4.5,"the best professor in the art dept. willing to help you  if you ask. is a difficult ""A"" but well worth the effort. i learned a great deal in her class."
3.5,The made me feel bad about myself 3 times in one year  but i think that just taught me to be more confident in myself. So she helped me out in that manner. I think she has one mind set. Its her way or the high way. I dont let her bother me  but I can't say i like her  actaully i dislike her a lot.
1,She likes to make you feel small and like you have no value. I was thinking about seeking therapy after her course  but I realized she just gets her jollies from making others feel bad. I guess she is on a power trip...maybe at home she beats her husband
1,Thinks she is the queen and we should all bow to her. I think she needs to retire or get a personality
5,At first I was afraid to take her class because of her reputation  but she actually wasn't what all I had expected. She has high expectations for your art work  but that's only to improve you  not criticize you and make you feel like crap. She is open to
5,Nodine is was she is. If you are willing to advance yourself she is willing to help you do it. She loves what she does and does what she loves. Keep a pocket dictionary as she prides herself on a sophisticated  multifaceted vocabulary. Academics  educati

5,Very good at what she does.
5,Dr. Das taught classes while waiting to get his residency to become a doctor. He really new his material in human phys and made the class interesting. He realized that students take more than one class at a time (something most professors dont understand!)
5,This was one of his first classes to teach and you could tell he wasn't interested in it. Still  very nice guy  very helpful and always remembers students. Has a really funny sense of humour  too. Got an A in the class without a whole lot of work.
5,Awesome teacher  great personality! I can't reccomend him enough!
5,Dr. Das is a wonderful teacher. I took his class 2 semesters ago and whenever i walk by him he remembers me by name and says hello. Very personable  makes you learn without being painful!
5,No Comments
5,Excellent personality! This is a teacher you can talk to in a down to earth fashion. He is always willing to help with any problems you have.
5,This teacher is excellent! He is super helpful  and wants his students to succeed!!
4,VICTORIAN POETRY is a great class that challenges you to think in new ways that expands your knowledge of the 19th cent. the assignments are very demanding and your thoughts/ideas are held up to a very high standard. sometimes it feels as though what you write is never what robson wants  which can be very exhausting/frustrating.
4,Tough grader. Thought the class would be easy and didn't work to improve my writing as I'm not pursuing a degree in the humanities. If you're serious about becoming a better reader/writer/essayist  I would highly recommend her. Nice person and seems passionate and knowledgeable. Take your essays seriously. She is not impressed by stoned rambling.
4,Sort of a tough grader but she makes her expectations very clear and gives a lot of good feedback
4,Lectures are always interesting and well organized. Likes class participation but it doesn't guarantee you a good grade. Tough marker but her suggestions will make you a better writer. Be prepared to put a lot of work into assignments if you want to do well. Essay/exam topics come directly from class discussion so read the books and go to class.
5,She expects a lot from students but you will learn more from her than any other English proff. Very helpful. She loves what she does.
1,This prof is archaic in that content and presentation need work--a lot of work--. Time to retire unless she could update her teaching style big time  really big time  Don't take.
4,HARD MARKER! That said  she's pretty knowledgeable. Hard to know what she wants at times. Don't take for a first year class.
2.5,Her class is awful. Hardest marker i've ever had  very boring lecture. And don't disagree with her ideas when writing a paper. You'll get an F. She'll say you're reaching from the text. Avoid her class.
1,Time to retire. I looove English but have been bored and sleeping due to lack of stimulating texts and content and way of getting the point across. When willl profs get with the program and be inventive  learning will grow exponentially.
1,She's pure evil...gave me an F because i'm not religious or a feminist...easily the hardest marker i've ever encountered in university  don't take her classes!
4.5,WOW! Amazing lecturer but horribly hard marker  she seems receptive to new and different ideas but even when a student has support to back up their claims if it isn't the same as hers you will do badly! BE CAREFUL when taking one of her classes...be prepped for a lot of work and not so great of mark in the end!
4,She's a good teacher  willing to help. She is CRAZY when it comes to marking  I think she forgot it was a frist year class marked way too hard would be great for a 3 or 4th year class
3.5,Tip: Write down EVERYTHING she says  except for those topics that she repeats over and over (just put a star beside it). I know its a little geeky  but you probably should reread your notes and rewrite them to fully understand. HARD MARKER! You'll be sucessful if you agree wuth her.
1,she's horrible  annoying to listen to  and picks favorites  it's VERY hard to get a good mark in her tests  even if u have asked her for help and she does  you'll still do bad...NOT recommended
4.5,"Last class she said ""sure"" 79 times. Emphasizes words to the point where you can't even stand to listen to her talk. Emphasizes S's --soo annoying."
1,evil woman  only gives you an A if you pretend you agree with her feminist/biblical agenda
5,Fair marker  clear lectures  helpful comments. Pro-feminist theory (I'm male). If you're a real English student you'll like her.
1,A horrible prof to take english with. Gives bad marks and dumb essay questions
4.5,She marks FAIRLY  and her classes are interesting. Good Prof.
4,Great lectures  but she marks hard. Not too bad!
5,Amazing professor. Highly intelligent. Will remove anyone's stage fright. Too bad he's leaving Seneca. Great asset Seneca is losing. They should give him the schedule he wants. Seneca making a huge mistake. Best teacher ever.
5,BEST PROF hands down  extremely helpful guy. Goes out of his way to help and definitely someone to use as a reference.
5,Frank Foster is a great professor. He is very knowledgable. It's nice to be taught by someone who is in the business field!! Would recommend him!!
5,Best Teacher
5,Awesome Teacher. Take it and go !
5,Great teacher  pick him if you actually want to learn something and get an A
5,He is a really good professor. He gives his real life examples in his lectures. Tests are easy and is a very lenient marker. He is very polite and goes easy on students. He is one of the best professors I've had so far.
4.5,Frank is a good man  I highly recommend him to you.
5,It had been a pleasure to be in this class. Frank has a world of knowledge he is intelligent and resourceful. Also  if he does not have an answer to your question(s) hexe2x80x99ll research it and attend the next class with an eagerness to share the information he has found. I would definitely suggest you take a class with this professor.
5,Frank is an awesome teacher! I love the way he speaks and lectures. He makes classes fun and enjoyable. He will turn the book that is filled with definitions to concepts that are easy to understand. I highly recommend him.
5,He is a great Pro.  easy marker very nice and helpful.
5,Is there to give u A+
5,He is explains things thoroughly. He uses example in real life and he makes it interesting.
5,Awesome teacher!! Always ready to help. helped me out personally. If you show that your trying hard hes ready to boost the marks abit..
5,I took Frank for MRK 320. He's very knowledgeable about his field of work and can provide real life examples of marketing and sales theory in practice. He marks pretty leniently. If you do the work  you will get a good grade. He makes himself available via email or office hours. If you have him as an option for any course  don't hesitate. Take him.
5,great teacher..easy marker..tells you everything you need to study for the quiz
5,Mr. Foster is hands down the best teacher out there. He teaches you the course in a way you don't want to miss any of his lectures. Never did I find his lectures to be boring. Extremely nice and very knowledgable. He is the only teacher that explained marketing so well to me.
5,Really nice professor. Explains everything clearly. Has really good powerpoint slides so you dont really have to read the textbook. Marks everything quickly.
5,Nice teacher and he explains everything.
5,He is a really easy teacher and tells you everything you need to do to get a good mark.
5,I agrre with the other things ststed. Just be respecful and show that your'e trying and you'll do fine.
4,I agree. Stay away from personal comments--about him--during your speech. He might not mind a wise crack  form time to time  but why risk it?
4,dont make fun of him and do the work he gives you. its not much but prepare each speech and youll do fine.
5,screwed some pple with grade in end  but he doesnt show up too often  and he s a nice guy. Just make sure your e on his good side  and do whatever meager work he tells you-well.
4,This class was really easy. Everything that was on the exam was somewhere in his lecture notes that he has for you on canvas. If you read those  and do the assignments  then you should be fine.
5,"Not a whole lot of formal teaching (there were some lecture notes  but not every week)  but the textbook he uses is very informational and easy to understand so ""teaching myself"" wasn't that much of a problem. Lots of extra credit opportunities. Would take again"
5,Great lectures  homework assigned helps with studying for tests. Practice quizzes were similar to tests. He responds to emails within the same day.
1,Say goodbye to your GPA after this class  did all the extra credit and assignments early. Yet the quizzes didn't match up to the exams so I bombed them.
5,Best teacher I've had at Pierce in my two years here so far. I highly recommend taking his class if you get an opportunity. Very clear grading with very manageable work loads. He always sets dates and lets you know what is due when and how to do it. Gives answers on all homework. Lots of extra credit opportunities. I ended the class with over 100%!
2,I've spoken with a few other students and we have all had similar problems this past quarter. The practices for exams are nothing like the actual exams  and the questions on homework can be extremely confusing. Doesn't really post much in the class or answer messages in a timely manner. No notes allowed  even though you must memorize a lot.
5,One of the easiest and best classes I've ever taken. Homework was a breeze but exams require a little more work. Textbook is FREE online! Lots of extra credit  he raised my 93% to a 4.0 amazing.
3,This economics class was a solid choice  for the most part. His online readings were very clear and had good insights into economics. However  He makes you do at least one exam in-person at the testing center. His two online exams were all multiple choice except for a few calculations. His in-person exam was all short answer and was quite harder.
5,This professor was awesome! He gives a lot of opportunity for extra credit  way more than any other professor I have had. It's really hard to fail this class. He drops the lowest of 4 exams which means if you like your grade  NO FINAL! Homework and discussions you get full points for just for turning it in on time. There are no surprises!
1,Give grade with no rules. You will not understand were your lost the point. And he will gives low grade to who has controverisal to him. It's unfair. And you will not get time to make up your assignment if you missed homework  even you have any reaosn. Too much detailed things that you mighy missed. Be careful to choose.
5,I enjoyed Sorem's teaching style and clear cut expectations. He actually reads your posts and provides you with specific feedback. I would take him in a heartbeat! Who knew I would love Econ. Thanks Prof!
4.5,Blake's lectures and examples are so clear I was able to easily get an A in this class. There's always opportunity for extra credit
5,Easy class. A good and nice professor and very very easy class. Can find most of the answers via Internet and assignments are clear cut.
4.5,Amazing professor. Class was easy to follow. Took it online and he included lectures every week to go along with the reading. Usually his lectures helped so much I didn't have to read the book. Easy to get in contact with  super helpful  and responds quickly.
4,great teacher  took this class to see I would like to go into business. hes a great guy long lectures and easy homework once a week i missed a few but he gives out alot of extra credit options
4,Awesome professor who made Economics lectures interesting. I was well-prepared for exams and all information tested on was covered during class lectures in detail.
5,It is pretty easy to get an A out of this class  as long as you finish the assignment and put effort on the test.
5,Mr. Sorem is by far my favorite instructor at pierce. He is very helpful  and clear as to what his expectations are. You do have to work for your grade  but he gives you all the tools needed to be successful in his class. I would recommend his class to anyone who is a serious student and ready for a great educational experience.
4.5,I thoroughly enjoyed my Econ 110 class with Sorem. He's very knowledgeable about his subject  and goes into great detail about what he wants you to learn and take out of his lectures. He'll emphasize what he wants you to get out of his learning  and the parts you need to focus on.
3.5,Had Sorem for Micro & Macro and have to say that Macro with him was much easier than Micro. He goes through the process of graphs with Supply & Demand rather quickly  so you need to be paying attention or you'll fall behind. Macro was much easier and a lot of fun with him. He definitely knows his stuff and keeps the class fun and interesting.
2,Jerry is a very nice guy outside of class  but two or three times he singled out students during lecture seemingly for the sole purpose of assuming they had made a stupid mistake  for the sake of discussion. His organization was poor  and I think he has somehow gained a monopoly over this course. Others could teach it far better.
2,It's been years since I took Calc 1 with this professor and I still avoid him on campus - never has a professor made me feel so low and stupid  and I don't even think he knew my name. I used to love math/front row student - now ...
3.5,I spent a year and a half getting to know math again and was just starting to learn it  love it  breathe it. After this class  I almost never want to see another math equation. All love for the subject was nearly obliterated. Great guy  but ruined my confidence in my math abilities completely.
4.5,Jerry is an excellent professor. I have had fairly poor experience with math instructors here at Western  but Jerry made the class very enjoyable. He is a great man and cares about each student. He learns everyone's name and tries to get to know you personally. Take a class with Jerry  you won't regret it!
4.5,He is unlike any other math professor. This class had many challenging concepts  but he was always insistent on making it fun (ie to learn about hyperbolic geometry  he brought in pringles)! He learns your name quickly and is always very personable. If you have to take a hard math class  take it from him!!
4.5,Jerry  as he insists on being called  is an excellent teacher and a great man. He really cares for his students and has a fun time getting to know them and teaching them. Holds plenty of review sessions for tests and will do whatever it takes to get you to pass as long as you try. Sometimes he's not crystal clear  but he will explain if asked.
5,Jerry is awesome  he really cares about each on of his students  his lectures are interesting and informative  I found myself actually looking forward to attending class(something i didn't think was possible in a math class). That being said his test are not easy  if you are gonna skip class and not do the homework don't take calc with Jerry.
4.5,Jerry is an amazing teacher. He's super helpful and involves everybody in the class. He's super easy to talk to-- in office hours and out. He takes time to learn about each one of his students. His class is so much fun-- he's hilarious! He'll make you like math more than you did previously  guaranteed.

4.5,Very interactive
5,Jerry is the greatest math teacher I've ever had. He's super enthusiastic and really cares about how you do in his class. He's always willing to help and goes above and beyond to help students feel important. The class does require a lot of time but if you pay attention you'll do just fine. He's just amazing
5,Jerry is an amazing teacher. He has the passion needed to teach difficult concepts. Jerry is always available for extra help and is very approachable. Everyone should try to take at least one class from Jerry while at Western!
4.5,Mr. Johnson is the best teacher I have had at WWU. I had him for 124 also and he made a class that may seem boring and difficult actually kind of fun. His enthusiasm and willingness to help are contagious and he knows everything to know about math.
4.5,He was one of the smartest math teachers I had. I took calc previously and the stuff I didn't understand  he would help me. His tests are just like they say they are  so pay attention. Also he is very class-volunteer oriented to make sure that everyone understands
4.5,This is one of the best math classes I have ever taken. Jerry is very smart and passionate about math. He makes some bad jokes  but other than that  he is a very good teacher. I would recommend him for every math class you can take with him!
2,This was the worst math class I have ever taken. I know some would strongly disagree but heasr me out. After taking calculus in high school from a fantastic teacher  I entered this class with the feeling that it wouldn't be too difficult. Granite I am a freshman and this was my first quarter in college  I did not expect it to be that bad. I was
5,this man is truly a nerd among nerds. but he's also a fantastic math teacher. if you like silly math riddles this class is for you. He loves to put tricky questions on the tests and there is a problem of the week which is basically a mathriddle that he wants to share with you. altogether not bad. keep an eye out for tricks and you should be ok
5,Samert  funny  will help for sure. Awesome
3,Do not take this class from Jerry unless you really REALLY love math. Jerry makes the tests much harder and longer than they need to be! His Final took many students 4-5 hours to complete  is this legal?? His lectures and HW assignments are pretty good. Don't miss his lectures  or you will be bitten. I wish I had not taken this class from him.
5,jerry is the man  definitely my favorite math teacher i've had at wwu
5,Took this class a few years ago...but still remembered the effort he put into teaching us. Was very organized  had excellent notes & gave us stories and tips to remember important information. Made a hard class fun.
5,Best prof ever had  too bad he left U of C  such an interesting class and totally entertaining stories
4.5,Fantastic prof. Intelligent and enthusiastic. Loved the hippo costume
5,You never know what Kawchuck is going to pull out of his bag - an extremely entertaining  energetic  and dynamic  Prof. A class is never dull with Kawchuck.
4.5,Kawchuck is one of the best profs I've had at UofC. Wicked sense of humour and extremely charismatic - makes an 8 am class worth your while to attend.
5,Professor Kawchuk's class is great! It may have alot of content  but it's the only class I truly enjoy going to  even though it's at 8 in the morning!
5,He is an awesome prof
4.5,Kickin Prof
5,its a hard course and early in the morning and he makes coming to class worth it.
4,He makes the material seem like a piece of cake.
5,The course material is overwhelming and difficult  but Dr. Kawchuk explains it extremely well and helps make it easy to remember.
5,A wonderful professor.
5,Best proff i've had at the UofC  is extremely helpfull and has an excellent attitude

5,Arlan is the best prof ever. He is so funny  knows his students by name  and it's clear to see that he wants his students to succeed. He cares about each student's progress and is full of knowledge and insight... there's so much to learn from this guy. If you have the chance to take a class with him  DO IT. 100% do it.
5,Arlan is probably the greates prof ever. Super funny  super enthusiastic  you learn alot while having fun. Super smart guy who wants you to do well. Take his class over anyone!
5,Hands down  the best teacher I've ever had. He genuinely wants every one of his students to succeed  and will work with you to help you achieve your goals. Arlan isn't easy on you  but in the way that he won't let you get away with doing less than he knows you're capable of. If you can EVER take a class with Arlan  DO IT!
4.5,Although I wasn't really interested in the subject matter itself  Arlan is an amazing prof. He's funny  energetic and really made an otherwise boring night-class bearable. If you're ever interested in anything that has to do with music and technology  Arlan is your man. Highly recommended. (oh  and his assignments are easy as well :P )
5,"Never forget to pay attention to the ""A""ness of the piece and when in doubt squish. (EWW  no... don't do that  did I say that?)"
4,A qualified instructor who tries to get the most out of the students providing them with detailed feedback on assignments.
4.5,Arlan is an all around good guy and if you put in a bit of time and effort  he will reward you well for it. great class.
5,He was awesome  just come to class and you will do fine the only reason a person would give him a bad grade is because they couldn't understand english... or didn't come to class. He was helpful fun and patience and very reasonable. Hell I wish my wife ha
5,Great and fun guy. Not very hard to get an A in his class. And you still learn!
1.5,Avoid him if you can
5,Dr. Mirabella is the best! She is a totally awesome person and really sweet! Not to mention funny! She is a really excellent teacher!
5,She is the absolute best teacher ever! I love her! She's really funny to! You're the best Dr. Mirabella!!!!
1,Just...dont.
4,She is awesome  read the readings  participate a little and you'll do fine. She is so chill  her discussions are awesome even though we always get off topic. I really loved this core class with her. She is a bit flakey and is late to most things  but she's still awesome.
4,"She is awesome. if you do your work and come to class you will do fine. she truly cares about her students. Seton Hall needs more professors like her. Don't listen to the person who said ""awful"" because they are the type that probably didnt do the work and still expected an A."
1,Awful
5,If you do the work  you'll get an A. Her class discussions were pretty depressing  and it was sometimes hard to know what she wanted in an assignment  but overall it was an enjoyable class.
5,prof m worked with me in 1982 and i enjoyed her approach to the above noted class.
4,She is very willing to help you if you haven't done well on your tests if she sees you doing what your supposed to. She is Libral and since she is a very important person on campus  has a lot of info to share. If your a Dem you will like her.If Your a repub  wellDiscussion will rise. Its a fun class
5,No Comments
3,Very Liberal  so she talks about her politics all the time. Your wrong shes right. Alot of class discussion.
1,No guidance whatsoever. Not organized. Not sure what she wants. She is very confusing.
1,whatever is written here is wrong. these kids are trying to get you to take a hard class. no kidding....its soooo hard  tests are impossible and there is sooooo much homework. DONT TAKE HER
5,Very nice person  helpful  and funny. Easy grader  especially during the summer session.
5,Excellent professor...
5,Professor Moore is the BEST math teacher I've ever had! I'm horrible at math and I struggled in this class but she helped me so much and never allowed me to give up. She truly motivates you to want to do well and gives a lot of positive reenforcement. Tests are all cumulative which is tough but there are plenty of review sessions. Take her!
5,Kathy Moore is the best math teacher I have ever had. If you can get in her class do so! She makes mathematics interesting and her passion for math makes her class fun. She is very helpful and will explain how to do the problems in very clear simple ways. Her classes are the only time I've enjoyed math.
5,Professor Moore was amazing! Makes math super easy and explains everything very well. You do not need a textbook so you will save a ton of money!! I strongly suggest her :)
5,PROF MOORE WAS THE BEST MATH TEACHER IVE EVER HAD. IM NOT GOOD AT MATH AT ALL AND SHE ACTUALLY HELPED ME UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE MATERIAL. I RECOMMEND HER. SHES SO PASSIONATE ABOUT HER JOB.
5,I really enjoyed having this teacher. I LOVED doing all the homework online  the due dates are clear  extra credit is literally on most paper assignments  she's extremely nice  and has many ways to help when you're confused (Herself  office hours and e-mail  SI leader  YouTube links for help). There's a lot of work  but not redundant busy work.
4,Great teacher but I felt this class was designed more for full-time students. 3 hour lectures twice a week  fairly grueling online homework  and online quizzes and tests almost every Friday and Saturday! I would not recommend if you work  especially full-time. Loved the online platform MOM  but could not handle the overall time commitment.
4.5,She's an absolute sweetheart  and very clear. She will help you if you get stuck on homework. She's actually a dog trainer which is pretty rad. Her homework is mostly online with some paperwork sometimes. Print out the book (It will help  believe me). don't be afraid to ask a lot of questions.
3.5,Mrs Moore is so helpful that at almost every opportunity there is a chance for extra credit  shes helpful and like in any class  DO THE HOMEWORK!! thats the only way to pass. she makes time available to help via office hours and through email and she has an SI leader help the class. Definitely gave me an opportunity to be happy with math again!
2.5,I will be honest  I am horrible at math. She teaches half lecture and the rest online. You must get them right or you won't receive credit. Have a question regarding the homework? She only has limited hours so expect to have a question or two only  because that's all you'll have time for. Get ready for a ton of homework. Tough.
5,Kathy is well aware most people dislike math and as a result makes great efforts to make this class as painless as possible. No textbook purchases are required too which is a huge bonus. Highly recommended.
3,This teacher is very friendly  but the tests are extremely hard and she gives quizzes every single day in the last 10 minutes of class which I found very frustrating  especially at the end of the day after a 2 hour lecture.
5,I lover Professor Moore!! Prior to enrolling in Math 80  I had no idea how to do a lot of things  and my pre-cal class I took in HS made my confidence lower about my math skills. She's very enthusiastic and not boring at all. I learned sooo much and she gives out a lot of extra credit! I definitely recommend her if you are not lazy!!!!
3.5,Moore is a pretty decent teacher  she helps and gives a lot of example during class if you're confused. Her test are a bit of a struggle and the homework and quizzes are all online. She does five of a ton of extra credit but make sure you don't wait till the last minute. All in all she wasn't too bad  I'm horrible at math and she helped me pass.
1.5,"Shes a very friendly woman  but she classifies herself as an ""auditory"" learner so most of her material is online and her lectures are mostly her speaking. Not a lot of examples. No book no actual homework to turn it. It's all online and on very vague notes. Would not recommend her at all if math isn't an easy subject for you."
1.5,Although she is a very friendly person and tries her hardest she makes mistakes in every lecture which only confuses the students. She wants her students to do well but it felt like we were learning the course with her and not being taught the course. I do not recommend this professor.
2,Professor Moore is a very friendly professor however her lectures are very unclear. She makes a lot of mistakes during lecture and although she corrects herself  it gets confusing. Her tests are extremely hard  and there was a quiz EVERYDAY!
5,She is very dedicated to helping other  and will meet you after class if she has time. Very friendly.
5,A math expert with a positive attitude  very informative  and willing to stay after class to help students. Be in class everyday for her lectures because she makes the lessons simple to understand than reading over the textbook. The class can be a challenge with number of quizzes and homework to complete  but tests are the killers so study daily.
5,super nerdy but super sweet.
5,I was having a hard time with math  but she really heped me understand. She dedicates extra time to those students who are having a hard time.
5,Took Dr. Knight for Creative Writing and was very pleased. The woman is absolutely hilarious. She was a nurse and a police officer before she was a professor  so her stories go from 0-100 real quick. You write 4 original pieces in various genres and you're done. 10/10 would recommend.
4.5,She was an amazing professor. Lectures go by very fast  and almost all of the time you are out of class 30-45 minutes early. She got to know all of her students. Would definitely recommend her!
3.5,No tests are given  all you have to do is write the papers. She truly cares about her students and learns each students name. Works with you on anything you need help with. Makes class go by fast.
5,I took her just for an arthumanities and since I like to write  I thought this was perfect. In this class we all sat in a circle  had group discussions  critiqued each other  and she gave awesome feedback. It's very open and laid back
4,She is a pretty good professor. She is very helpful and cancels class A LOT!!! When she does have class you mostly sit around and talk because she is very laid back.
3,I don't think she was gender-discriminate  but rather had favorites. Class was fine  though she was extremely critical. Best advice--take her lower levels first to get some favoritism before this class. Otherwise  its an uphill battle from the start.
1,UNFRIENDLY---DON'T LIKE MEN! BEWARE!!!!
5,She's a great teacher! I loved her class. She tells great life stories. If you can take her for anything  do!
2,i really don't know who could find her helpful or challenging at all....my lit ap teacher in high school challenged me more! you spend less than 30 minutes talking about a story  write like 1 paper and then waste the rest of the time talking about nothing...class for an easy A and lazy people
5,She is very helpful
5,I have taken a few of her classes. I also chose her as my senior seminar coach. She was very nice and helpful. As a teacher--she is a jem. She was always excited about the content and she made us feel the same way.
5,This woman is the reason I finish college!!!! Wish they were all like her.
4,She is a very open-minded professor. This class is an easy A. A few papers here and there  but she is always available to help! If you are unable to do something or maybe just having a diffucult time  she will work with you.
5,She is so wonderful. She helped me so much and I owe alot of my A's to her class!
5,i had her for more than 7 or 8 classes. she changed my life. thank you  Dr. Knight  if you ever read this. my name is Donovan  and everyone should know how great she  and the entire english department at USCS truly is. Thank you so much.
5,She is an awesome teacher. She's very easy. You have to write a couple of essays. Half of the class if going to be watching movies and your final project is going to be an essay on a meaningful song. She is a great teacher  Awesome!
5,A WONDEFUL LADY WITH A SENSE OF HUMOR. VERY DOWN TO EARTH AND HER CLASS IS A BREEZE. DO TAKE HER IF U HAVE THE OPP. SHE IS A BREATH OF FRESH AIR AT USCS!!!!
5,one of the best teachers i have ever had. one of the most fun too
5,Such an amazing and wonderful lady. I learned so much in her class and didn't miss a day or wish to miss a day ever! Teachers and classes like hers is what college is all about. I want to take her as much as I can and I'm not even an english major. Wonderful person  makes you think! A MUST!
5,PLEASE TAKE!! She is wonderful  very in tune with collge students and what interests them. I took her twice... LOVE HER!!
1,She will make you wait outside the classroom if you are late for even a minute. If the assignment is 2 pages she wants 2 FULL pages.....no more and no less??? This is a vigorous course cuz you HAV to work in groups  its already tough for people like me who prefer solo but its whatevs. Getting an A? Dont think so  gettin that A is impossible.
3.5,Dean Willis is so inspirational and will be missed at SJU. I learned life lessons in her class and it helped me learn what life will be like when I am a teacher. She brought guest speakers in to keep us up to date with the many changes NY has in the DOE. Great class definitely take if you have the chance to!
4,Thee most toughest course you will ever take  this is coming from someone who is an Ed. major. This is a course where you actually learn and not be lazy. This professor is obsessed with the friendships. The critical issue for this course is that there is a lack of time. 3 hours per class would be perfect....I love this class! Why must she retire :(
3.5,She is a great prof. Im a transfer & I have to say my other school (edu wise) was much better until I took Dean Willis class theres a lot of group work but thats preparation for us as future teachers we are going to make a community with others so we need to start now. I hope she doesnt leave shes the most helpful person in school of EDU undergrad!
5,The fact that Dean Willis can put up with me proves she is a worthy professor. Saying that she's helpful is an understatement. Yes all the work is done independently but we need the class time for stuff to prepare us future educators. I dont see her class as a form of advertising but more of an informative class#DeanWillisFan Ty for this experience
5,Dean Willis wants people to get to know each other because it is important to know your students. Whomever wrote the comment before should not be a teacher at all. Take advantage of what you learn and teach it and don't look to hurt someone who truly cares about her students. She is an amazing person and I am so sad she is leaving SJU.
4.5,Amazing. Simply  simply amazing woman.
5,By far the best professor  dean and person at St. Johns. I've never learned so much in a class. She keeps it real with you and gives you whats expected in the real world. For once in my life I would be upset when class was canceled! Please take her for 1008 or 101. And easy A none the less!
5,Dean Willis can get annoying & act tough and get all in your face but her class is fun & you'll learn so much. Honestly her 1011 was the best class I have ever taken. She keeps it real and tells you everything you need to know. No textbook or tests. Mostly class presentations and 2 papers. Final is bringing diner from home. TAKE THE CLASS!
5,Easy class. The midterm is the hardest part  and she or her assistant give you all the answers the class before. I also took her for Human Relations. She's amusing and a great person. Easy Pass or A.
5,Prof Willis is a true class act and the consumate professional. She is an asset to SJU. She sheppards many young teachers through the process in a great way. She has my absolute respect and regard.
4.5,Haters stop hating. Charisse is probably the most real person/professor/dean you will ever confront in your lives. She is well-rounded and does all she can to relay her knowledge to her students. If you let down your guards and allow her to teach you  you might actually learn something about yourselves as an individual. You EARN your grade!
4.5,bottom line charisse is a great women. her classes are fun but intense. YOU WILL LEARN ALOT!!
4.5,Absolutely love her. She is so down to earth and will tell you like it is  which some people like/ need. Gives a few simple assignments and is there whenever you need her. Had her for this class and orientation to edu and I will take her any chance I get!
5,once again the bestprofessor ever. this women is an amazing professor who gets her students involved so much in class that you sometimes dont even realize ur learning something. i would definitly say that you need to take her classes because its well worth it. Definitly ganna be keepin in touch with her because she is such a great help
5,Just Amazing!
3.5,Easy class  we just hung out really. She gives random assignments  but they're easy. Make sure you do well on your group presentation though. She's really cool and a great dean. Get to know her because she's willing to help you out with anything.
5,Amazing amazing amazing teacher AND dean. She goes out of her way to please all her students! Take her if you can!
4,SHE IS SIMPLY AMAZING!
4.5,she is one of the best teachers i have ever had she is amazing
1,He sucks.He never lectures. he takes attendance and dismisses us. I don't get why i paid for this class if he never teaches us anything. i'm pissed this will lower my GPA for sure.I need to talk to a DEAN.We go to class take attendance  says he forgot his lecture slides or repeats a lesson and then we go home an hour early.I'm mad. Horrible teacher
5,Dr. Martin is the best yet hardest professor I ever took in my years at SAC. I took him for two courses in the mid 1970's. He is a great lecturer and a fair test giver. His exam essay questions are difficult yes  but not unfairly so. If you love history
1.5,This was by far the hardest class I took for my first semester of college! Mr. Martin is a great guy as a person  but he expects way too much! His exams are all essays and he expects you to know every little detail! If you're ok with getting a C or lower take his class  if not  RUN!
1,If you're just trying to get units for your general ed  this is not for you. Quizzes are given almost every class session and he is a very hard grader on essays. He'll give you 8 essay questions to study before the exam  pick four of the essay questions  and then you only answer you. You basically waste your time studying 6 extra essay questions.
1,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. There is a reason he has over 40 ratings. This is my first time rating a teacher because I need to vent. 1.) Not a teacher.. You take pages of notes almost every class that he reads word for word off a slides show. 2.) He Is very slow 3.) GPA killer. Test are all essay question in which he grades very hard. 4.) BORING!
1.5,majority of grade based on essays
2,Do not take his class. His lectures are to mixed and he goes to fast to take any notes. His assistant was not my favorite to say in the nicest way. The final is 3 essays and 5 descriptions of people or places. I would advise that you pick another teacher. I mean look at his ratings... Nice guy but not a good teacher.
4,Great professor  easy reading quizzes and essays. You do NOT have to be a good writer or be smart  you just need to READ. Those who didn't read got a bad grade. Those who did got a great grade. If you go to SAC  there won't be an easier History 101 teacher. Just READ for the quizes and STUDY for the exams  and you'll be good.
2,He was an ok professor. You have to do the reading for the quizzes  and you have to be a good writer for the exams  but if you pay attention and do the reading it isn't really all that hard. I got a B+. He does like to hear himself talk though...
4,Dr. Martin is a great history professor. If you do the work required  and take responsibility for your own grade  you will like him. If you don't do those things  you won't like him.
1,Professor is useless w/o his t.a. test r essays which in my opinion are b.s. he grades on his oponion not the facts. Tests are all from his lectures and power points which are horrible! He forgets what he's talking about half the time. And relies 80% on is assistant.
1.5,His tests are based on his lectures  not the textbook. He won't let you record lectures. His grading is harsh. You'll end up working thrice as hard as you would for another history class. So unless you're in love with history AND are a part time student  don't take his class. Your GPA will suffer  I got a B and I worked harder on this than math 140
3.5,He's a great professor  but getting an A is rare. If you're interested in history and do well in it  I recommend taking him. He lectures well and isn't boring. But if you hate history and you're just trying to get by your gen ed  don't. His grading will affect your GPA. He doesn't grade unfairly  he just grades hard. There's a difference.
1,HORRIBLE professor  forgets what he is about to say. Extremely hard  expects you to remember every single detail. Do not take History 101 with him!
2.5,GPA Terminator!!!!! want to find out what that means? sign up for his class
1.5,he will waste your time or lower your GPA. avoid this teacher. do not take..
2,Yes  this class is as hard as everyone is stating. I recommend this class for anyone that is a history major. If you love history  take this class. If you don't like history  like I  don't. Overall  he is a really  really  nice guy. As a professor  he is not the best.
2,Took his class a while ago at SCC. He expects you learn everything AND when you try your hardest for the BEWOLF essay  he will give you a low grade
1.5,Unfair teacher. Expects you to know every exact detail that happened in history. Do not take if you are not a history person
1,ok professor  not all of us are willing to dedicated our life to history. Hard test  boring lecture  tend to get loud. Just try to avoid if you care for your GPA
3,She is an ok teacher but i think she is bi-polar. She is happy one minute and then the next thing you know she is screaming down your throat. Don't mess up whatever you do. She is now teaching at columbus state though.
2.5,She's a really hard teacher. You definitely can't slack in her class. Her tests are really really hard  so watch out.
5,I like Lisa a lot  she is such a wonderful person!
3,No Comments
5,Has lots of experience.Very approachable. In this field we need a caring side for patients and not just Porfessor side. They both work together. She has it!
5,I came to IU thinking I wanted to pursue an econ degree
4,Prof. Walker is the best professor I've had here at IU. He's always willing to help you understand the material  and is committed to student success. Grades tests and returns them within 24 hours. While this class requires good calculus knowledge  he makes all the calculus applications super accessible. I would love to take this course again!
4.5,Everyone was telling me how hard intermediate micro is  but it really isn't too bad if you go to class. Prof Walker only tests on the material he teaches in class and assigns in homework. Just go  take good notes  and study a tiny bit and youll be fine. Walker passes more students than any of the other econ professors  so take 321 with him.
5,Best instructor I have had in my four years at IU - very knowledgeable and clear communicator
5,Terrific teacher in every facet. He has perfected the teaching of E321.
4.5,Good professor and a cool guy. Super helpful to go to office hours. His exams really test your understanding
1,He's probably knowledgeable about econ  but he's really bad at teaching it. His lectures are not organized at all so the main idea is usually lost on everyone.r Avoid him if you can.
2.5,He is not very good at explaining things  but the workbook is very clear so that's all you need. I didn't pay attention hardly at all  but you'll do fine as long as you study a lot before the tests. If you're going to take this class  take the honors version with him!
2.5,One of the best econ profs you can get! If you are able to take the honors course..do it! with walker  it's easier than regular course. not a lot of hw. he prepares you well for his tests!! and go to CL! it's helpful!
4.5,Very good teacher. Professor Walker is extremely knowledgeable on the subject. He makes you feel free to ask questions and offers clear explanations. With that said  the material is fairly tough. MC questions on tests can be tricky. Overall  I got a good grade but I have never studied that hard for tests in my life. Still he's a great teacher!
5,Professor Walker is awesome. He gives good explanations and examples  and he seems enthusiastic at every class. Before class he played classic rock music. Attendance is important and this class requires work  but if you put in the proper amount of time you will do well in his class.
3.5,If you go to every class and CL  you will get A- at least.
3,Prof. Walker is a good teacher. I feel like it's really hard to understand what he is actually trying to say most of the time though. However  if you read the book and actually study and try to understand vs. memorize the material you will be fine. If you put effort into the class you'll get an A/B bc the tests aren't extremely hard conceptually
5,Walker is the way to go for econ. Clear explanations  and his tests are much more straightforward than Self or Olsen  who love to throw in trick questions. I had econ prior to taking this class  and thought he made it pretty interesting. Go to CL  do the workbook questions  and you'll do well.
2.5,Great teacher  funny guy  and his workbook helps so much. Everyone who takes Olsen regrets it. Take Walker  NOT Olsen. Great class and pretty easy to get a good grade if you put in the time doing practice problems and practice tests in his workbook.
2,Everyone seems to give him good ratings  but in my experience he hasn't been especially helpful or clear. He obviously knows what he's talking about but moves too quickly and seems to be bored/annoyed at teaching such a large class. If you work hard in his class you'll do well  but don't expect him to be as awesome as everyone says he is.
4.5,I really hated econ in high school  but Professor Walker was much better at explaining it  and I actually like the subject now. I found the tests a little difficult  but not too hard.
5,Explains everything very well and makes it interesting. Gives you several extra credit opportunities.
5,Professor Walker is good at explaining the subject matter and very helpful. He really wants his students to succeed. I had to end up dropping the class because it was just too much with too many credit hours but if I were to try econ again I would definitely try to get Walker. He makes economics interesting and he's also friendly and funny.
4.5,Do NOT buy the parkin book! you will never use it. do do the homework on a regular basis and do go to CL. It all really helps.
4.5,Great for new law students. Not for the faint of heart  as the issues are esoteric  in volume  and there's really no time to fool around. Prof. Frey really cares about his students and those who study law. He is what he is: a no-nonsense professor who isn't there for fun and games  but one who is there to bash Kx into your mind!
5,The best teaching professor at TU Law! Take secured transactions with Prof. Frey.
5,"It's been ""awhile"" since law school...but  I thought Professor Frey was GREAT...he was my all time favorite law professor! He was always available...and willing to answer questions. He really cares about his students and wants them to succeed. Marty ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Strong knowledge and approach  although grades hard. Good professor to introduce new law students into the study of law  not to mention contracts.
4.5,There's a lot of bashing here. I'll bet not from anyone who has practiced. Prof. Frey does a terrific job of preparing his students to practice law  which is what the majority of his class is there for. His contract theory served me well on the bar exam and in the eight years since. Tough? Yes. But excellent.
1,I am now stupider for having taken this class. I can't imagine why schools keep hiring him. Learn everything yourself  but make sure to learn it his way. Impossible exam  3 hours  closed book  14 essay questions  about a million issues. I would fake an allergy to Oklahomans and transfer out ASAP
1.5,Paradigm. BlahblahblahRhetoricalQuestionRhetoricalQuestionBlahblahblahr Paradigm. Paradigm. Paradigm. Google Me and you get 4 returns for No breach excuse and they're all linked to ME!!!! Paradigm Paradigm Paradigm Rhetorical Question 64 issues in a 3 hour test.
1,I am still painfully lost after this class - I feel like I learned nothing compared to my other classes - even CivPro was better! Avoid at all costs if the school has went and renewed his Kx. Know his paradigm  useless as it is.
2,the most painful experience in law school. offer  acceptance... go through your paradigm
3,There is no offer or preliminary negotiation here  Marty stinks straight up and is rather arrogant to boot
1,"Probably the worst class I had all year . . . completely unclear  the ""paradigm"" was totally unhelpful . . . yikes. Hopefully our school will never have him visit again."
2,This guy is a Joke! He was a visiting professor at my school in the spring of 2003. He had the opportunity to teach at a major law school and really messed it up. Unfortunately I learned nothing from him. Tulsa you deserve him  LOL!
5,Best professor I've ever had. I want to be her when I grow up.
2,She's an unforgiving grader. doesn't take anything late. it could be 10 seconds late  but it might as well have been 10 days late  she won't take it. She may be good at English  but she really doesn't know how to teach it. doesn't always spend class time wisely. May act like she care about the students  but she really doesn't. 310.
2,She was rude and arrogant  and cared way too much about the LART program. She scoffed at anyone who had a differing opinion about that class. The information was pointless  yet we did SO MUCH WORK.
4,She was brilliantly insightful and went out of her way to make her students feel valuable. A difficult class  yes  but untimely useful for future classes.
5,This professor is very helpful and teaches about very relevant material. She expects a lot from students  but it's all worth it. I learned a lot and would definitely take her class again!!
3.5,"As a person I like her a lot. I also like her as a teacher  I think she teaches very well  personally. However  she is very ""unforgiving"". She accepts nothing late and is a very harsh grader. Be wary when you join her class if you aren't good at getting things in on time. But if you are she is a very good teacher and person."
3,Alright
5,She's difficult  but she cares about her students if they care. She's incredibly clear and well-spoken  and I've been to her house for dinner and she's an excellent cook.
1,Hated this class!!
2,She is very smart  but definately arrogant. She expected a lot  but we are college students  the one problem I had with her is after she read our papers her comments were very harsh and she made me feel so judged no matter what I was writing about
2,I hated going to that class. She expected way too much  had no mercy  and her comments were harsh. She seemed to be intelligent  but to the point of arrogance. And I hardly ever understand what she was talking about in class. Glad that class is over.
4.5,I thought that her poetry class was really fantastic-she really pushed us to do our best work and taught me a lot about understanding and writing poetry.
5,An informative and invested teacher.
2.5,This class includes a lot of writing.
1,Terrible professor. Out of 25 students only 1 actually liked her. It's tough to get all your points on her assignments. She requires students to write on the level that she does. If you're signed up for her get out immediately. First semester I had a B in English  and then I took her class second semester and got a D. Now I have to redo the class.
1.5,She knows writing  but not how to teach it. I think her new personal life is getting in the way of her job and she is not able to successfully teach her class. Everyone I've talked to about it hates/hated her class because her grading is ridiculous and she is sometimes unorganized and unprepared. She loses some of your assignments as well--no mercy
4.5,She exudes grace  even in the midst of difficulty. She will stretch and challenge us  but the outcome will be worth it. HSe is a class act  who knows her stuff!
5,Prof. Miller is a very intelligent professor. She really knows and has a passion for what she does. She also hopes that her students will become engaged and at least somewhat enjoy what they do. She's very helpful  and although she expects A LOT from her students  we are  afterall  in college aren't we? You learn a lot from her.
1,has basically a mail order mfa from spaulding university. you go there a few times and do correspondence work and they hand you your diploma. her teaching reflects how little she actually knows about poetry  and her lack of a decent publication record reinforces it. one day maybe au will hire a real poet but i doubt it sincerely.
1,No way  Jack. Avoid at all costs!!!
1,Gives as little information as possible and if you ask for clarification  shame on you. I get the impression she thinks being a secretary is a high level position. Makes me wonder if she has an education. If not  she may want to consider taking a communication class.
1,Very unwilling to help and when she did answer a question it was never the correct answer. She sets you up to fail.
1,What a waste of skin. Talk to anyone but her. Cannot give answers to the simplest direct questions.Does NOT want to help.
1,Just a very rude person. Why Mrs. Greig doesn't fire her and find a better representation of the nursing program  is beyond me. I'm sure she's good at what she does  but there are many people out there that could do just as well  with a better attitude.
1,"could not have been less helpful if her job description read  ""completely ignore students  or make them wish you had!"""
1,secretary
1,i have an idea  shake up a magic eight ball because it will give you more accurtate responses to your questions than she will. and i agree with the rest... the anti-christ was more polite than her. did i mention she lied to every question. i would of chosen a different nearby nursing program if i knew this one was so messed up
1,The most unfreiendly  unhelpful person I have encountered. Why this women still maintains her employment is beyond me.
1,the most unhelpful secretary I have ever encountered.
1.5,You'll get better answers talking to a wall
1,Not helpful and usually rude. Acts like she HATES her job. Never gives you the time of day and always acts to busy to help you  which i thought was her JOB!! She needs to find something where you dont deal with people.
1,She is the secretary for the nursing dept. very hard to get along with. Very rude and short with you when asking questions. DOes not call or email you back. Not helpful at all. Acts like she hates her job. You get better answers calling director.
1,"Not exactly a gift to the English Department. Those who know her best refer to her as ""Tyra the tyrant."""
1,Very defensive personality. She wants her students to have her opinion  not their own.
1,Hasn't mastered basice grammar and spelling herself. Unbelievable that she was hired. Unfair grading and very defensive personality. Avoid this professor.
1.5,If you don't write the same way she would  don't expect a good grade. just because you say something differently doesn't make what I said wrong. she needs to realize she didn't make the rules of english  and their are other ways than her way.
1.5,I got all A's in English until I had her and got a C. She and I just didnt mesh personality/belief wise and she let that effect my grade--even though I did everything I could to please her. She was so rude
2,Think you're good at English? Is that what your last prof led you to believe? Dr. Seldon exists to prove you wrong. That only path to an A is to mimmick her own writing as well as possible. Drop the class if you like yourself.
3.5,She doesn't use class time very well  many canceled classes
5,If you want help you have to go and ask for it. If you are interested in improving your writing she is an excellent teacher. If you just want an easy grade choose a different professor. She also uses class time very effectively. I have really enjoyed her.
1,Not helpful to students. Doesn't really care about student concerns for the class. Dictator.
2,She is patronizing and blame-shifting. She does not respond well to criticism  and did not seem entirely willing to work with students on problems.
5,No Comments
4,Always available for help  and has a real passion for what she is teaching.
2.5,The tests are really hard  but it doesn't matter because he gives so many opportunities for extra credit. His class is extremely boring. DON'T TAKE AS ITV CLASS! He rambles about stuff that is never on the test. He talks like Zoolander.
4.5,great teacher  helps students achieve a good grade. isn't like teachers that like to fail you. hes a good guy with a good heart. Good communicater also if you email him one day he'll email you back with in the day. all test except map test are online
5,great teacher  helps students achieve a good grade. isn't like teachers that like to fail you. hes a good guy with a good heart. Good communicater also if you email him one day he'll email you back with in the day. all test except map test are online
1.5,HORRIBLE! He's a very nice person  but he tends to ramble and lecture about things that aren't on the test. Then the tests are about things that you've never even heard of. Half of the class failed every single one. The labs are ridiculous and half the time  he doesn't even know how to do them.
5,Dr. Sambrook is awesome! You have to take the time to build a relationship with him! He is shy... talk to him and he will talk back! I went the whole summer with him to Ecuador and had an absolute blast with him! He wrote me the most touching letter of reference so I could become a teacher! If you are bored... you are boring!
4.5,He's such a nice guy. His tests were a bit hard though. Alot of the things on the test he did not cover in class so READ the book!
2,I took this through ITV  and it was all I could do to keep from falling asleep.
3.5,So boring! I had a hard time actually listening but it was a pretty simple class. I took at ITV so if I didnt get to take the test on blackboard I would have been ruined because the test are hard he uses every detail of his lecture in the book or not
3.5,good but boring teacher
5,Nice  clear  helpful  a very good professor. One of the best.
4,Was a very nice and intelligent guy. I would definitely take him again.
5,Took this as an ITV course at the main campus. Pretty boring  but map quizzes were easy. Lets you take test online through blackboard. pretty easy. Had him for GEO 201 and he did the same thing.
3,It's alittle boring.There is alot to learn. Take notes. Write down everything he will putit in the tests/
4,No Comments
5,Knows a lot. You will learn a lot from him. His teaching style is kind of dry  though.
4,No Comments
1,Good luck passing this class if you are male. Also: keep your head down
1,A truly difficult and unhelpful teacher. Avoid like the plague!!!
5,Dr. Clark is the best professor I have ever had. She is a loving  intelligent woman that improved my writing skills. She is funny and allows students to interact and learn as a group. Take This Class!!
1,No doubt the worst teacher I had in four years at AU. Petty  mean spirited  unforgiving  rude  difficult  stingy with time and praise  unwilling to deal respectfully with young students.
1,Easily the worst classroom experience I've ever had. She is condescending and rude and seems not to like male students.
2,Some are writing teachers because they can't make it as writers. She is one of them. Very mean - very arrogant - lousy. Okay as a person  but not as a prof.
1,Mean.
1,O can't stand her as a teacher! She makes the stupidest corrections on papers when nothing needs to be corrected  and if you dont agree with her your grade is screwed. Her husband is better than her
1,horrible teacher!
1,terribly into her own ideas
5,One of the better professors at AU.
1.5,she taught me to be a worse writer. her comments were most unhelpful  and her attitude in the classroom is condescending and self-important. don't try to disagree with her
1,No Comments
1,here is a teacher who really has the proverbial head up the proverbial sewage pipe.
5,She is a great professor! I loved her class and thought that she did a great job teaching it.
1,worst teacher at AU
1,Easily the worst classroom experience I've ever had. She was rude  mean  and I second what the last person said about her hating men. Avoid like the plague  like Ebola  like a long cross-country car ride with the devil himself.
2,My gosh  is she awful! Hates men  it seems  and is tremendously unfair in her grading. Wrecked my GPA over a technicality. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!
1,The worst teacher I've ever had in my life. Boring  self-absorbed  obstinate  thick-headed. Horrible  horrible teacher.
5,She is so much fun  and so easy to talk to. You have to take at least one of her classes!
5,Chris is wonderful. Lightyears away from F. Lenny. He will give you a lot of work  but he gives meaningful assignments. He will always help you out and never treat you like a pest. You must attend class
5,"Had him twice  the first time I was just so overwhelmed by everything that I got out at midterms. Took him the next quarter and he was nice to me and treated me fair. I gave the best presentation for midterms and he was really happy for me. One of these days I have to remember to send him a ""nickel"" "
5,Mr. Claflin is a great teacher. Very helpful and REALLY TEACHES WELL!! you will learn allot in his classes. But if you dont do the homework you will be lost and won't catch up. He's not easy but he's not hard. Just do your work and show up. He expects the quality of your work to show your level of experiance and grades fairly from person to person
5,He wants things done his way  which translates to the real world. The assignments take a lot of time to do.
5,you really know your stuff
5,Claflan is the best by far. He is a great teacher and he knows his stuff. Although he gives you a lot of homework  it is well worth it.
2.5,No Comments
4,Fun but tedious. I remember pulling all nighters for that class but it was way worth it!
4.5,I also had him for Perspective. He's awesome and will help you if you go to him
5,He is one of the Top five greatest teachers Ixe2x80x99ve ever had hands down. He listens to his students  is clear and understanding. Always a pleasure even if I end up retaking the same class. I procrastinate  Ixe2x80x99ve got a problem. xe2x80xa6lol
5,If every teacher was like this guy  this school would be worth the money
4.5,great professor. Comprehensive  fun and never gave an assignment that wasn't necessary. although  i mean  cmon...he does kinda have a troll-like quality to him-doesn't he?
4.5,Awesome guy. Very energetic.
5,He's so cool! Whenever I feel like giving up he inspires me to keep going.
4.5,Chris is the mother freaking best! Especially when he lets you make a storyboard that includes Menuedo and Haggis and Sloths!
5,Chris Claflin is one of best instructors I've ever taken at any school... All his assignments are dead on for what you need to know to work in the industry. Warning  those not serious about learning  don't waste his time.
5,I was always told storyboarding was intimidating. In fact  as you transition from class to class your not sure how to bring all lessons together in the grand scheme of drawing -until Claflin opens your eyes. He's innovative  amazing and passionate about how your art an idea's are valuable to storyboarding. Have faith --he'll guide your right. (SG)
5,Had him for 3 quaters in a row  and enjoyed him being my teacher.He's hard  but fair and is a really nice guy and helpful too.Great teacher overall!
4,Claflin does make you waork hard  but he provides a good environment to work in and be in
5,"Chris Claflin is a great guy and great teacher. He used to be a storyboard artist for ""Duckman."" Great class  but no longer in the curriculum."
5,Owen has been my favorite teacher at Missouri State. Upon writing this  I've discovered what has happened  and I am deeply saddened. Owen was an outstanding person  and it is a great loss to Missouri State and the world alike. I'll miss you  Owen.
5,We'll miss you Owen. You were a very caring teacher and a great guy.
5,He was a great teacher and will be missed.
5,"You were a great friend  Owen. We had a lot of great times. You were my sounding board when I got frustrated. You were a credit to our department. I am going to miss you very much. Until we see each other again  ""dude""."
5,Rest in Peace Owen  you will not be forgotten.
5,Owen is fantastic! I hate math and he made me understand it. He is so helpful and he is a really cool guy. He's funny and shares great stories.
1,"Absolutely do not take unless you know everything about Trig BEFORE entering this class! Goes over the most basic examples and expects you to automatically know how to do the more advanced problems. When I said I didn't remember anything from College Algebra  his answer was  ""Not my problem."" AVOID!!!"
4.5,Owen is fantastic. He is a really nice guy and a great teacher. If you have any trouble  he is always available to his students. I would love to take another one of his classes.
5,He is laid back and makes the math very easy to understand
5,Great teacher with a lot of passions and concern for students!
2,He is really lax about getting grades into the computer.
4.5,He was an absolute godsend. I took this class with 3 different professors  and he explained better  taught better  and kept the pressure off better than I thought was possible. There's a good reason his classes fill up fast!
5,He's a cool guy and pretty laid back. He explains the notes very clearly. He will do anything he can to help. Don't miss class or you will get behind. He gives homework that can bring you up up a letter grade. He gives somes extra credit. The tests are somewhat hard. If you go over the notes and his study guides they are fine.
4,He is a little confusing  I think. He does things ont he board that doesn't even matter. I would recommend going to class  but he is really nice and helpful if you are having problems.
2.5,Not a good teacher for people who struggle with math.
4,Owen is a really fun guy. Just make sure you keep up with your homework and STUDY for the tests and you will be in good shape.
4.5,He made me understand and like math
4,"DO NOT take him if you are bad at math! He is super nice and willing to help  but he will do a problem on the board and then say ""dont do it that way"" he is a little confusing sometimes."
4.5,Great teacher!! The best math teacher I have ever had. Very laid back and willing to help you. Has a great sense of humor as well so he tries to make class enjoyable.
4.5,Take any class you can with him. I got my first B in Math since 6th grade. Tests aren't bad and his isn't strict.
5,Where you guys attending the same class as me ? He is one of the best teachers I have ever seen at McGill. His classes are interesting and he values what every student has to say in his classes. They should clone this guy and replace many of the duds McGill currently has in the management faculty.
4,"I'm a little surprised at the comments on here. Lank is a passionate  dedicated  thoroughly engaging prof. I was impressed by the dedication he exhibited to his students. He regularly spent 30 minutes after class with me discussing issues that were only tangentially related to the course. As Ebert and Roeper would say: ""two thumbs way up!"""
1,AVOID!!
1.5,A business thoughts built in my mind?....I doubt it.
1,Emotional Scars might fade away  that big fat F in my transcript won't.
1.5,not very impressive  frankly speaking
1.5,The blah blah style course... should you want to learn something  stay away...
1,The tuition should have had a better use. I only remember his pages-long list of titles now.
1.5,Want to take this course? Think again! Professor Lank does not hesitate to give out 30%  or 4 out of 10 grades in exams and assignments  even in group assignments. Do not think you cannot fail because it is business course.
1,Absolutely find no worthiness. This old gentleman try to tell you what is patent and shareholder agreement  which you'd better Google cheaper  better and faster. Do not expect any practical thing from his class. He is apparently enjoys hisself in class.
4.5,Great guy.....great class....a little phony though.
5,This guy is amazing. The best !!!! He is nearly 70 yrs old  but has twice the energy and euthasism than professors half his age. His respect for students and love of teaching make all the other teachers in McGill management look mediocre at best. This guy should give a class to the McGill professors on how to teach and motivate students.
5,the best prof EVER
5,Amazing teacher. A philosopher more than a business teacher.
4.5,Great teacher  good speakers  but class objectives a little too vague.
5,if you have to take a class in mgmt  this is it  everything else is honestly hell - david way to go! if life was a cupcakes  DAVID'S THE FROSTING!
5,Lank was the most amazing  inspiring teacher I've ever had in my life. I thought this class would be boring  but it was so interesting. Lank really believes in his students  and has this tangible excitment that makes you want to better the world yourself. AMAZING prof!
5,Consider yourself lucky if you have the priviledge of being in prof. Lank's class. It is rare to encounter a teacher who so genuinely cares for and believes in his students. Certainly more than just an entrepreneurship course- prof. Lank's eloquent lectures inspire you to do better.
5,There are few teachers that trully make a difference in students' lives
4.5,No Comments
3.5,Very helpful in TA sections but not so much in lectures because it's difficult to be specific in philosophy with 300+ people in a room.
4.5,Professor Woody explains concepts in more than one way so everyone can understand. She is enthusiastic about the subject  which makes lectures engaging. The TAs do most of the grading  but she is there at her office hours for extra help or clarification. This was by far my favorite class of the quarter.
4.5,Shes really awesome. Her lectures are very interesting. The class overall was very interesting. Especiallly because shes into what she does.
4,About this class: turned out to be really interesting  although readings are long  they're interesting to read. Not a hard class  reasonable amount of work  do consider if you're in need of W credit. About Woody: It's easy to see how passionate she is. Although she is slow at explaining concepts  she is indeed knowledgeable. Her TA's are amazing
5,Dr. Woody genuinely cares if students are learning or not. This class was so interesting and really broadened my interest not only in philosophy but also in the performing arts  she also gives great essay feedback. I feel lucky to have been able to learn with her and would highly recommend her to anyone who wants a teacher who genuinely cares.
4,Professor Woody seemed very passionate about the subject and I had no doubts about her knowledge level. She was enthusiastic and answered questions well during lecture. She posted the slides online which was very helpful if you ever missed a class. Only thing I didn't like was that lectures were very long and not much interaction with audience.
4.5,Woody is overall a great professor
5,My favorite prof at UW  well-prepared and enthusiastic for lectures  and foster student's own thoughts a lot. Easy-going on hw deadlines and very helpful at office hours
5,Andrea Woody is one of the best professors I've had. Super knowledgeable and teaches effectively. Even if you're intimidated by the sciences  this class will give you interesting insights. Best of all  she really cares about her students and philosophy of science. Go to office hours  she is also a great mentor!
4,Excellent lecturer  but I did sometimes fell a little lost. The readings are only moderately hard  but I recommend doing them if you want to get anything out of the class  plus there is not too much. Grading was fair and she is incredible at office hours.
4,Intensive  but very interesting. I wasn't able to put as much effort into it as I wish I could have  and that's a sign to me that it's a good class. She certainly knows what she is talking about.
3,Interesting class  but not one that a student with a non-science background should take. Too much reading to complete in one quarter and nowhere near enough time for assignments.
5,No Comments
5,excellent lecturer! she uses a lot of overheads  making her lectures easy to follow. she values student input and is very open to answering questions.
4.5,Great teacher but is tough.
1,doesn't really speak english. very hard to concentrate and learn from. weekly quiz on fridays that you cannot make up  no matter what reason  even if a relative dies. major jerk.
1,This guy is hilarious... what a damn fool... I had no prob. with the class  only because I took it once before in highschool... By the way Pan  we speak English here... IMPOSSIBLE to understand this guy  and I knew what he was doin'. Also  consistantly wr

2,I respect him as an elder and professor. But there is one thing to be aware  Pro. Pan is at his retiring age. For me  it was very difficult to hear what he is saying and in addition to that I could not even see what he writes on the board. He still has the skills  but the problem is in addressing wh
1,C.T. Pan is a horrible teacher. He does not care whether or not the students do well in the class. He is impossible to understand  not only in his speaking but also in his writing. YOu might as well wear a blindfold to class and plug your ears.
5,A+  good teacher  makes u learn and think. Has an accent
1,He is the worst teacher at NIU. He doesnt speak english.....he doesnt even write in english. You cant understand a word he says and when he write on the board its just scribbles. If you get him your doomed to fail. Everyone in my class did!
5,awsome teacher  he makes you think for yourself and really put in your own effort instead of just giving you the answers. nice guy too!
1,Its insane to let this man teach.You go back to 155 Dr.Pan.

3.5,I took him for intro to drama! It was an easy class  he does require you attend his class as well as two of the theatre productions and write a report over them but it wasn't difficult. Sometimes the plays are fun to watch! Overall I think the class was easy!
3,Decent at showing examples of carpentry. Reads straight from the book. READ the book to pass the mid-term and final! However  if you want real knowledge of technical theater  go to shop!!!
4.5,He is an awesome professor
1,I took intro to drama for what i thought would be an easy elective  it was not. I attended every class and would strongly recommend a different art credit. I made an A in every class including Biology and Chemistry and I promise this class took more studying to pull off an A. The history of Rock in Roll is the best way to go for an art credit.
4,He's good professor..
2.5,He read straight from the book. The tests were easy if you studied at all.

5,The best professor I've ever had. Even as an alum i want to go back and learn more from her. There isn't a professor at Denison as in-the-know or as active in their field as Amanda. Just fantastic.
5,Best professor ever.

3,Mediating Gender and Sex is really boring. She could have made it a lot more fun. Into feminism. Looking back  the class was a lot better than I thought it was at the time.
4,Very nice person. If you do the work/reading  you will be fine.

5,very good at explaining things
2,not helpful when I went to get extra help.
3.5,"Flaming... but its a good thing I think. Super confusing as you have at least 3 different ""cases"" going on at all times. Strick  has surprise pop quizzes  and doesnt explain things well. He thinks everyone who takes this bio 150 is going to be a bio major or pre-med so he trys to sort the best out."
3,hes hard and can be snotty
4.5,Biology of Science Fiction Spring Semester 2002 Rocked!!!! Such a nice prof. and the class was so fun! Big ups to the talent show! We rocked! One of the most fun and interesting classes I've taken and I'm not a bio person at all! ~~LL~~
5,Studied in Santa Barbara  CA. She knows a lot about religion.
4,A very fun professor
5,Lian laoshi is an amazing professor! He will say whatever is on his mind  is very funny  and genuinely cares about the progress of his students. In class he explains things very well  and will take a concept slowly if you do not understand. In addition to class time  he is willing to meet outside of class if you need extra help. 10/10!
4,A GREAT professor  clear and helpful  and has endless comedic anecdotes. I loved the class  I wish I could take Chinese with him all four years!
4,A great man  very funny  but he does not care about political correctness  which makes for interesting classes. Will assume that all students of Asian descent are/speak Chinese. Very wise  knows EXTENSIVELY what he is talking about. Homework is intense  and necessary. Papers take a LONG time to do. Overall  a great professor.
4,He is SOOOO funny!! and he knows what he is doing. With all the best jokes from Prof. Lian  you will find yourself loving this awesome class.
2,He wasn't all that great but not terrible.
5,Most amazing professor ever.
4.5,Don't take this class unless you are extremely interested in learning Chinese and have the time to devote to it. If you do  this class will be amazing and a lot of fun! Prof. Lian is SO funny and a great help! He will make the learning experience more interesting!
5,This man is amazing. Sheer wisdom. Love at first sight...that's all I have to say. I wish I could take Chinese for the rest of my life. Oh...and he tells the absolutely BEST jokes.
4.5,Prof Lian is amazing. He is incredibly funny and is so passionated about what he is teaching. Everybody knows this guy is good guy  but don't let this fool you when it comes to grades. He can be hard. Take a class with him if you are interested in learning something  because believe me  you will. Great class. I enjoyed it.
3,Good class  good prof. My only complaint is that if you don't give him EXACTLY what he said  in his own words  you don't get full credit for it. He also hasn't given anyone in this class more than a 9/10 on a paper yet.
4.5,very good and amusing professor  his classes are always of a very relaxed nature  if you don't like his sense of humor the first day of class you'll probably hate the course
4.5,Professor Lian is a treasure  a man of singular kindness and humor--not to mention staggering amounts of learning. I took his philosophical taoism class through a course-sharing program with Kenyon College  and even over a TV uplink he was fantastic. I would kill to protect this man.
4,very fair and nice teacher.
5,Prof. Lian is a fabulous teacher! He teachs and explains in a very clear and concise manner. He assigns just the right amount of homework and grades very fairly. Besides that  he has a great sense of humor and makes the process of learning very fun. Take a course with him! Lian Laoshi hen hao!
4.5,Awesome Professor. Very good at explaining difficult concepts. Take a class with him!!
3.5,I love Prof. Lian. He's tons of fun to talk to in Mandarin  and willing to help you improve. He has a wonderful sense of humor  and is a wonderful language teacher.
5,I've taken many classes with Lian Laoshi...Chinese and Taoism and I love him!!! He is one of the nicest prof. and the most fair: in grading  work load  etc. If I could take a class with him every semester  that would be awesome! ~Laura (ou luo lan)
5,Took first online class and was amazing with Prof. Saunders. Gives great feedback and sufficient time to work on each paper assigned. Makes the online class interactive with the other participants. If you spend sufficient time on assigned papers and comment on other people's work you'll do well in this class. Responds quick to emails. Shes amazing.
4,I was very intimidated at first but it wasn't as bad as I thought. I am not very good at anything English/Lit related so it was tough for me but I ended with a B+. You just have to participate in the discussions as much and as well as you can. It was online but she seems very easy going and friendly.
4.5,Professor Saunders  is very clear on what you should expect for a lit class. If you have questions ask her  If you don't understand why you got a certain grade  she will answer it  and give decent to good feed back. Also  make sure you do the work  PARTICIPATE at least three times on the discussion board  and she is very FAIR with grades as well.
5,Most attentive get right back to you right away clear honest and smart teacher online I have ever had! grades weekly. Sense of humor and cares about how you do. You do have to read the work and do research.
5,she was great! I took her for Freshman English II just now would definitely recommend her..I got an A..she was very helpful  met several times and helped me edit my paper. Very reasonable  gave the class an extension on the paper  no complaints. She's pretty funny too! And does online classes..take her :)
5,12 DAY INTENSIVE! LOADS OF FUN AND GOOD CLASSMATES INTERACTIVE!
5,If you've never taken an online course  don't be afraid. This teacher helps you and is understanding about tech frustration. It's a great LIT course. I loved the readings and also reading my classmates' work. I learned a lot about them and myself.
5,Great online class! Prof. Saunders was really nice and super helpful when I had questions. I really recommend taking her class.
5,loved her! she was so helpeful and always gave me the best advice on writing my papers and how to improve them. She was just wonderful! her class was also really fun and i surprisingly enjoyed doing the work.I highly suggest having her as one of your teachers you'll really like her
5,Professor Saunders is a serious teacher and will help you out if you take the work seriously. She has been very helpful to me and understanding. Plus she makes the work interesting.
5,good teacher
5,Prof. Saunders wants you come to class and do the work.If you have ar problem  she is very understanding and she also knows about the school andr how to sign up for classes.
5,Prof.Saunders helps you with your writing if you ask her. She takes a lot ofr time with your writing problems and you can learn if you keep at it.

3,easy as it gets for literature  never bought one book for both classes and cut class all the time and still got B's. imposible to stay in her class with dying of boardum. if you need an easy class..a must take
2,No Comments
5,very nice lady  she fun to listen to and speaks honestly. if she thinks your not trying she'll tell you so  she'll also tell u when ur doing well. her assignments are strieght forward. she does soften the rough edges of literature so if u loved harpers cla
3,Nice Prof  she was having a lot of issues the semester I had her  but I made a A-  and she let us use our handouts on tests.
3.5,If there are no art majors in the class  she gives pretty easy projects but if there are  she gets pretty difficult. Also having to write a paper for the midterm and final is a pain. But she is very sweet and nice.
2.5,Her projects are very time consuming and she gives a midterm and final paper. This is an art class for God's sake! Just because she was once an english major does'nt mean we need to suffer. Take her class if yiu want a pain up your ass!
5,i've had her for a few classes  and a few portfolio reviews. she's no ****  no frills  and will tell you straight up what's good and what's crap. i think she's my favourite professor in the department thus far.
5,she is kind and understanding and helps you to nuture your skills. she is pretty cool so if you have any problems just talk to her and if you put in th effort you will get a good grade.
5,I took her 3 classes before. she is nice. just need to be a good student. talk to her then she will understand and thinking for u.
4,Professor Himmelbaum is an experienced  kind  and valuable teacher. Do not be discouraged. I love her!
5,She's a real nice lady sensitive  helpful  kind  always edges you on  and helps build on your creativity!
4.5,She is a very good teacher. Wants to see you succeed in class. Will help you in every way she can.
4,Great Teacher....very nice to work with and she knows what she is doing. She takes a motherly approach to her syllabus. Makes everyone participate. Loved her class
4,This instructor grades too strict  she tries to make the course difficult when its really not.
2.5,She grades very hard. Test one was a slap in the face. Very tricky. She expects you to read the chapters on your own and be ready for the test. I advice you to NOT take her class.
4,Dr. Brown as she says  is a okay professor. She is not all that hard. READ YOUR BOOK because she lectures from it like a pastor gives a sermon from the bible. I didn't care for her cockiness and she only gives you an A if she likes you. All in all if you are up for her conceitedness she is alright  but I tell you the attitude is a challenge!!!!!!!!
2,"I love speaking in front of people and crowds but once I got into her class she really tried to discourage me from being who I am. I dont like the way she talks to people. She is very sarcastic and cocky. She likes to ""talk"" about herself alot and what she has done. She doesnt care about other people's feelings or what she says to people. very bias"
4.5,An easy A. Attend class. do your work on time and participate.
1.5,No Comment
1,I have never received anything less than a C since Kindergarden. I love school and I love learning.I am currently taking a full 15 hours worth of classes plus more and I still haven't received anything less than a B. She is a teacher that rates you on how much she likes you rather than your work and she needs to retire. He time has came and went.
5,Professor Brown taught me during summer 2008. She is a wonderful instructor  very enthusiastic and very fair in her grading. A lot more understanding that people give her credit for.
4,Be ready to give group  ind presentations. Use correct english  u should get an A
5,All I can say is she is the best. I will recommend everyone to take her class.
5,The best of the best! Very enthusiastic professor  well spoken and knowledgeable on the subject. A true inspiration to me
1.5,This teacher base her grading not on what u do in class but how much u kiss her but and since I didn't kiss her but she gave me a F!! I did pass my test and speeches and still don't understand how I got a F! Stay away from this teacher if u have to take comm. at another campus. It's worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,She is full of energy and the class is quite easy but she is picky when it comes to speeches. If you are not an a$$ kisser than you need to be sure that your paper is A plus material because if you don't suck up and you know that you did at least a B she will give you a B- or a C.
4.5,No Comments
5,She's a very happy and thoughful teacher. If you take her class she will make learning about communications interesting. She'll work with you to help you pass her class. And a great person to talk to inside and out her class. I will still keep in touch with her after her class.
5,Mrs.Brown is full of energy every day She always has a smile and she will help you as much as she can  all you have to do is ask. I like her and I enjoyed her class.
5,Don't be stiff during the speeches. Bang on the table and get your point accross as if you are having a conversation with your friends  but be proper. That's the only way you will get an A in her class. DON'T BE STIFF and boring and have some flavor and creativing writing in your speeches.
5,The best professor I have had in Gettysburg - so inspiring  so clear  so helpful.
1,worst teacher ever  you cannot understand him unless you speak japanese  and he is very mean
1,I agree with the car accident guy
1.5,This man is a sadist. He will make you feel very very small.Do not bother volunteering in class he will shoot you down real hard. To the people above who said he has high clarity  they must speak Japanese because I couldn't undestand this guy.
4.5,probably the best prof i have had at gburg. he is always willing to help and teaches the students in the most concrete way. if you are an econ major  definitely take one of his classes.
5,This man is a genius. I have the utmost respect for him. There are many very smart professors at Gburg but this man blows them away. Its a very hard class but he's a fair grader. He also takes the time to answer any of your questions anytime.Niiro Rocks!
3,He is a very intellectual man  but also a tremendous nerd. He really tries to humiliate his students in class  which is definitely wrong.
2,I might have something to say about his teaching abilities if he'd ever show up on time to anything  prepare for class  or teach the classes he's scheduled to teach.
4,He's brilliant and charismatic. His passion is contagious and he really cares about the subject  his students  and the world. Great teacher!
4,"liked to discus off the reading information  showed lots of videos  easy ""assignments""  all papers for the grade  NO BLUE BOOKS  and VERY interesting"
3,Very challenging Professor -- he pushes students to think in creative ways. Unbelievably sexy  too.
3.5,Very difficult  but very dedicated teacher.
1,No Comments
5,She was very passionate about her teaching. She always tell you what would be on her tests. Attendance sometimes is required in order to know what is going on in the class surrounding. She is very kind and helpful. Not a lot of homework in her class  though. Easy A.
5,Dr. Vanderhoof was a great person and was very fair on grading  almost too easy. Both me and another person received 100% in the class without even putting that much effort into it. I do believe some of my class mates and I could have passed the test to be waived out of a computer class  but it kept my GPA up and was a nice experience.
5,Great teacher  very understanding
4,She's a really easy teacher. She doesn't make it harder than it has to be  and she is very helpful when you ask for her help.
5,Dr. Vanderhoof was such a joy to take. Do not take anyone else but her for this class. She assigns sort of a lot of homework from the book but it's so simple that it's not a big deal. She is the sweetest lady who teaches like you're back in 2nd grade again.
5,Take her class. You will not regret it.
5,Probably one of the nicest professors you'll ever have. She's so helpful  really organized and her classes are almost NEVER the full time. Her study guide is almost the exact same thing as the test. Overall a really good teacher and nice lady
5,All Professors should be so good. As a non-traditional student returning after 30 years  I can honestly say that she is the real deal. I would have quit again had she not inspired me to excell. Thank you Dr. Vanderhoof!!
5,Sweetest lady ever! Hardly ever makes you stay the whole class period. Most friday classes last ten minutes.
5,Perfect!
5,Dr. Vanderhoof is amazing! She understands that most students are taking her class b/c it is a required Gen Ed  so she makes it as simple as possible. She almost NEVER makes you stay for the whole class period. Very kind woman and great professor!!!!
5,she is so sweet and easy
5,She is a great teacher! Very organized and she definately makes her expectations clear. Lectures are well organized  and she gives study guides so you know exactly what you need to study for tests. You often get out of class early especially on Fridays. She has a good sense of humor  and is very willing to help you if you need it.
5,EXTREMELY EASY! My friends told me it was easy  but I was not prepared for the simplicity of this teacher and class. She explains things VERY clearly  almost to the point of condescension. Lets you out early a lot and if you read aloud in class when she asks  you usually don't have to go to class on Friday. Highly recommended...
5,She is the best professor I have had so far in college. She is very helpful. She keeps this very dull class interesting.
5,I thought she was fantastic. Organized  thorough and fascinating. She was very punctual  always let you out early and was very clear on expectations. If you are one of those idiots who can't follow concise directions  or can't leave your phone alone for 45 minutes...do us all a favor and don't take her. If you can  you will love her!
5,If you have to take this class  do so with Dr. Vanderhoof. If you don't you'll be sorry! She's very nice and very helpful both in and outside of the class. Oh  and ask her about her 'Vettes  too!
5,Very respectful  awesome teacher. But she is PAINFUL to listen to. She teaches this class as if you've never seen a computer in your life. She is ALWAYS organized. You will never stay in class for the full 50 minutes  and hardly ever need to stay moer than 10 minutes of Fridays. Do whatever you can to take her class. Great teacher  and good humor.
5,She was the most polite and helpful professor I have ever had. DEFINITELY TAKE HER!
5,Very nice lady
4.5,this guy has the easiest job i have ever seen... but he is a cool guy though so i would take this course with him. all you have to do is walk laps the whole time and you will get an A. he sweats alot  and ive never seen him work out  i find it funny
4,Matthew is a good professor. The quizzes though are very hard unless you spend a lot of time studying.
5,"SUCH AN EASY CLASS!!! Just do the online quizes and labs  bs them if you want. I got them done in about 3 hours with the free 1 day trial  saved me about 37 dollars. I would definitely recommend him! Just show up and at least walk around the gym. Easiest ""A"" I have ever gotten."
5,He was a very kind and understanding. He wasn't judgmental and was reasonable. I'd recommend him.
5,Easy professor. Just show up  do the easy 5 questions quizzes and free answer labs and you'll pass. Easy A.
4.5,such an easy class if you just show up and do the work. If you miss more then 5 classes you automatically fail. Do the online quizzes and labs right away to get them over with  takes like 3 hours to do everything and then you're done for the semester basically.
4.5,Reimer is awesome. His class is extremely easy! He has no tests and all you have to do to pass the class is show up. Total work for this class is 15 (5 question) quizes and 10 labs. Easiest college class you will take. I lifted weights every single class period. He's a nice guy and doesn't care what you do at all. Strongly recommend him!
2.5,Real immature professor. I mean it's gym so it's an easy class  but it feels like high school and he's a **** about attendance. Take someone else if possible
5,i think i did really poor on the online stuff so i got a b but pretty easy class he sits on the bikes upstairs the whole time
4.5,Very easy class as long as you show up! Reimer is a nice guy and explains everything well. EASY A!!!
4,If you're lazy  like me  take Reimer for your PESS requirement. If you want  you can just walk around the track for 40 minutes. Easy. You don't really have to exert yourself too much. Plus  he's almost NEVER in the fieldhouse during class time  so you can take breaks and he won't even notice. Some students even sat around for the entire period.
5,Show up  do the activity of your choosing  and fill out the sheet. Sit down and do the coursework online in two hours. Easy A.
1,It's Basketball  all you need to do is just show up  and show off your 3 point skills  and make it rain!!!!
5,Ha! Ha! The class is easy! He doesn't even talk to you every day. It doesn't matter who you take. But your heart rate does go by 6's! Show up and fill your log sheet!
4,He was easy  you don't have to do anything but show up  make sure to do all the online quizzes and thats about it
5,This guy's an ass.
4,I got deducted so many points for doing MATH wrong in his class! C'mon! Make sure you divide your HR correctly. The class is unstructured  but make sure you do the damn online quizzes (20 bucks) to pass the class. Waste of time and money  oh well!
1.5,WASTE OF TIME and MONEY!! Make sure your heart rates are divisible by 6 or you'll get docked points! What a crock!
2.5,the guy is kind of a jerk but the class is easy maybe try a different proffesor
4.5,Waste of time  but added points to my GPA for an easy A. :) I'll take it. Show up  hang out  work out - you're done. Waste of $130 but whatever.
1,Nice personality  bad teacher. She said  military has a problem with authority and insults her students. She brings her political views in the classrooms.
4.5,She challenges you to write better  which should be the goal of any college level course. One of the best professors I have ever had.
2.5,I did not like her so much as a teacher. First day of class she told us that some of is will not be passing. Very hard grader and critical. If you do not participate in class you will not get a good grade. Also HATES Disney movies. I tried to talk discuss that and got shot down. Especially Lion King!
2,She is beyond awful! She teaches the class in such a way that no matter what you say she will try to say you're wrong. And when you ask her a question  she will not reply with a straight answer. She always replies with another question. Not very helpful unless you meet one on one. And still not much more helpful.
2.5,It is Super hard to understand what she wants from you. She is a nice woman though. Very tough
1.5,Grades very unfairly
3.5,She is a good teacher but gets a little crazy and can be confusing at times. Is much harder than the profs my friends have had in ENG 106.
5,I thought she was very helpful and a great teacher compared to other english professors that I have come across.
1,The worst teacher ever!!
1,Crazy Tracy... that sums it all up!!
2,this class sucks!!!!
1,No Comments
4,I thought this was a great class. As someone who was not very fond of english  I really enjoyed this class. It helped me think differently.
2.5,This woman is evil!
4.5,Rohy is quirky for sure  but she is able to break down the most complicated material to anyone. Also  she encourages adventurous essay topics
5,Wonderful professor. She's smart as a whip and funny too. Material may seem impossible but she makes it easy to digest. attendance is mandatory (you can miss a few days)  grades are split between class participation  blog posts  and papers. NO TESTS :)
2.5,very dry. took her class because of the good ratings  if you are going to be taking English 86 don't do it with her!
3.5,"Interesting subject matter- good grasp of subject  but during discussions she does squint at you as though she thinks you're the s****of the earth. Not sure whether I buy that it's her ""thinking"" face. Grading seems random- people who don't read do well  people who do read fail. Laughs at her own jokes...also  wipes spit a lot. Kind of annoying"
5,I love this woman. She is extremely smart and knows what she is talking about. The workload is managable although she is a tough grader. She is witty and funny and will take the time to explain whatever it is that you do not understand. I encourage anybody to take a class with her. I left her class feeling smarter because of her.
4,"Very dedicated professor. She's great at explaining complicated theoretical texts and connecting them to the ""larger picture."" She's a tough grader  but here's a tip: if she allows you to turn in a rough draft of any essay for her comments and suggestions beforehand: DO IT. You will have a much better understanding of what she's looking for."
5,Unbelievably smart and has a wonderful way of boiling down ridiculously complicated critical essays into terms the average person can understand. Also is very funny in an intellectual sort of way. Had her for English 86 and am taking another class with her next semester solely because she is teaching it. A favorite.
5,Tough class - but she did a tremendous job explaining intense theoretical issues with the texts. And she is incredibly helpful.
5,Awesome. Very interesting  dedicated prof.r Strange  but in a really cool way.
3,She is very smart and extremely dedicated  but not very good at leading/provoking class discussion.
5,Some students are totally lazy  but if you are motivated you will learn a bunch
5,If you actually read the material  and make the connections between the theoretical and the primary texts  you're golden. Prof Rohy makes every effort to help in this process. She answers emails always  and is more than not in her office. She's very  very dedicated
4.5,one of my fav all time classes!
2.5,She spent time on books she shouldn't have  her grading system is very questionable and her class is not very interesting
3,Ugh. This class was so boring. She isn't good at stimulating interesting discussions  and practically has to pry reactions out of students. The book choices are not great  either. She is nice and helpful  but the class is unbearably boring.
1.5,unclear subject matter  plays favorites
3,The class discussions in general are dull  uninspired  and hard to follow. The professor tries to be helpful decoding what we are learning and is a fair grader  but the class is just unbeareable and completely unenjoyable.
3.5,The discussions we had in this class were not guided and vague. I felt it needed more direction. The books we read were close to unbearable. Class sucked but she is a helpful professor.

5,Great class. Do the work and put the time effort into the workshop and that's all he can ask of you. Besides this class he has been super helpful in getting my portfolio together and academic advising. Great teacher  great guy.
4,No Comments
5,His books were definetly not mediocre-- Story of a Million Years is breathtaking and The Wolf Girl is really bizzare and fascinating  and plenty of literary critics agreed. I didn't love UVM and transferred out  but just talking to him made school more palatable for me while I was there. I'd take another class with him if I was still there...
3,Seems to be a very fair person. I like listening to him read aloud  but not everyone does. His written comments are sometimes odd.
5,No Comments
4,Huddle is laid back  good sense of humor  but beware- in this class at least  75% of your grade is pop-quizzes on the readings. They're easy  but you have to do the readings. Also  class can get a bit dull (you read out loud a LOT)  but is mostly easy and a good excuse to just read the books.
5,good-natured and fun  one of my favorite classes. the readings were enjoyable  too.
2.5,He is really anal about reading aloud in class  but his intentions are all good and the workload is pretty easy. I thought when he handed out signed copies of his book it was a nice gesture  though he does have kind of a bad taste in literature.

5,David Huddle is the best teacher at UVM.. He is indeed the greatest
5,No Comments
5,Best class ever. Best professor ever. David Huddle's classes are always great. He creates a wonderful and supportive atmosphere for workshopping. He is always respectful and constructive with criticism. He also has a great sense of humor. If you have an opportunity to take a class with him  do it!
5,Lots of workshopping in a really mature and supportive atmosphere. Always makes himself available for extra help. Encouraging!
5,Inspiring  helpful  understanding  talented  etc. His writing classes were amazingly helpful to me.
5,Great class  great teacher. Hilarious  but 75% of your grade is based on in class quizzes. But if you do the reading you will be fine.
4.5,No Comments
5,Such a wonderful professor. He really know how to teach you and how to calm you down. He has a very special way of helping you understand the world and yourself through writing. You would be missing out if you don't take his class.
5,Harris actually made me like EN115. Great teacher. I'd recommend to anyone.
5,Amazing teacher. He really helped me get better at writing and was cool when I asked for an extension. Everyone should take at least one of his classes.
4.5,Extends due dates  as long as you talk to him. He is super chill. AWESOME PROFESSOR! Would totally recommend!
4.5,Immensely helpful! The essays are actually fun to write because he gives broad topics. Super chill. Extends due dates  as long as you talk to him. AWESOME PROFESSOR! Would totally recommend!
4.5,I had a fantastic experience with Prof Harris. He's extremely nice and I learned a lot about writing from him. Also had a fair bit of interesting life advice/stories that I'll always remember and helped his students maintain perspective - overall an excellent prof and I highly recommend for EN115.
4.5,Extremely helpful. He expects a lot and digresses a lot  but I learned so much from him. Take his classes if you can.
1.5,For a guy who can't get his own poetry published this guy was pretty tough on other peoples art. What we learned were his prejudices about poetry and how to write representational poetry. He needs to realize that anyone who does the work is really trying to be creative and be sensitive to how hard it is to put personal stuff out there like that.
5,Words cannot describe how wonderful Harris is. If you're dreading the Eng Req just take any 115 Harris is teaching! He spends most of class teaching you about life but he knows how to incorporate the important English basics. Participate in his class  he will never be a jerk and allow you to formulate your ideas. I love Harris!
3,Harris is an interesting man with fantastic insights that he's eager to share. The class is interesting but often lacks direction. Harris really wants his students to improve their writing and he's available for extra help. However  he's really unclear about what he wants on assignments  which creates a lot of confusion. He also cusses in class.
4.5,Great professor  though very demanding as well! I learned a lot in his class
4.5,A good guy and a fair grader. Overall a different but very solid professor.
5,best professor at this school. this man is brilliant.

2,Prof. Harris is such a chilled out teacher and very fun but is often unclear about assignments.
5,Best professor I have ever had. This guy is AMAZING.
4,She is very simple. The class is clear to follow. She can be a bit of a picky grader  as she will not really give perfect scores for simple assignments. She does let you re-submit to gain back any lost points and lets you turn in late assignments. Easy to approach. Easy to get a good grade if you just go to class and do all the assignments
4,Dr. Saffran is an excellent choice for Biochem2. The class is either filled with seniors or graduate students so you're not competing with freshmen anymore. Her tests are tough  but fair(NOT LIKE KUMAR!!!) and expect the occasional trick question. She adjusts the grade by a few points based on how well the class is doing. STRAIGHTFORWARD!
5,This professor makes basic biochem pretty easy if you pay attention and go to lecture. Her lecture notes are clear and is willing to answer questions. As long as you put in the work on your end and do the practice exams  you will do well.
3,I took the class because I am going into a research based career. It is very informative and helpful toward that goal  but the professor doesn't respond to emails. It sort of frustrating as you start to do the 15 page paper at the end of the class.
4.5,Biochem 2 isn't very difficult. The material isn't hard to grasp and understand (at least to me). If it is for you go to lecture: Saffran's explanations will make this child's play. What makes this course challenging is memorizing reactions. Put the time in and youll also have an A and still be able to recall almost all the reactions a year later.
3,what a pointless class. you learn absolutely nothing and she comes off as cold. she is so picky when it comes to grading. honestly  it seems pointless to even GO to this class. i thought introduction to research would be more informative  but this class is useless and thats it.
5,Simply the Best! Allows re-submission of assignments for a better grade. Good class for those interested in a research-based career
5,easy professor. very clear and helpful. as long as you understand the materials in class (which is impossible not to)you will do fine on the exams. I didnt need to read the textbook at all. all i did was go over my notes  which was what she wrote on the board.
4,The class was interesting. Learned a lot about different QC faculty research interests which helped me discover my own research pursuits. She is extremely accessible by email or by meeting before or after class. A research topic that interests you is chosen and a 15 pg paper and presentation is based on that. A great intro to the world of research.
4,she seems nice and sweet  but shde is really not  very unclear about research  useless class at all  just need it because it looks good on transcript  total waste of time.
5,She is really sweet. Made it clear what she expected from students. Brought in department heads to talk to us about their research so that we could see what we would potentially be interested in. I learned alot about how to conduct research & I how to find a research mentor and start working in a lab. Final presentation & Term paper are reasonable.
4.5,Makes terms more easy. She takes her time explaining the subject. Slow paced. Yet she tends to repeat herself a bit. GO TO CLASS and just listen to her. she is great. slides are clear  textbook not so much but does help in dire needs. she will make u understand chemistry like never before.
4.5,She makes chemistry sound easy. She teaches slowly  straight from her slides. The tests come straight from that  but be careful with math mistakes. If you have the choice of professors for this class  take her.
4,She is excruciatingly thorough  she explains everything in minute detail. But overall a good teacher. Tests are fair  harsh grading on easy questions and more lenient on the harder ones.
4.5,She's alright. Better than other chem 113 professors. Test's are fair.
3.5,great! understandable  approachable. slides are clear  come straight from book  but i would suggest getting it anyway bc its helpful. requires work but saffran is the way to go for sure!
4.5,easy class  go to class participate. all u need is to write a ten page paper and give a presentation. its hard to read her to kno if she is happy or not with u. but still eary
5,helpful  goto class and get her notes. every exam is straight from her notes. Puts chemistry into an easy perspective and does not demand too much except to do well in her class. you will enjoy this professor alot.

4,Makes biochem manageable.
4,Dr. Jackson is so awesome. One of the smartest people when it comes to literature. She gives a ton of mini reading quizzes  so read and you'll do fine. She's a fun professor. Take her if you can!
4.5,Science Fiction and Fantasy Lit is a great class  both because of the subject matter and because of Prof. Jackson. She assigns stories for nearly every class  but they're all things you can knock out in an hour or two  at most. Do the reading and you'll ace the quizzes  plus she's more than willing to review papers and offer useful suggestions.
4.5,Take Science Fiction and Fantasy Lit!!! Jackson is soo incredibly helpful!! She gives so much feedback and will reply to any and all emails in a very timely manner. There are quizzes almost every class  but you just need to read to pass! Its very easy! The essays and thesis proofs are not bad as well! YOU WATCH MOVIES TOO! VERY interesting class!!
4.5,Overall  Dr. Jackson is a good professor  friendly  and easy to reach. Jackson is very picky and I also believes she grades students based on her history with them. As this was an 8 week course  the work was fairly easy  but increased toward the end. Make sure to have the materials and read. The class discussions were great  you must participate.
4.5,Dr. Jackson is a very good professor. I had to take her class because it was required. Her quizzes are fairly easy if you read before each class. She is a tough grader when it comes to essays.
5,Great professor! Very clear about her expectations  fair grader  and extremely helpful. READ THE MATERIAL before class  daily quizzes  easy stuff if you READ. Have opinions and be prepared to share them. 2 major essays. Overall  her class is worth taking  never a dull class and you will learn a great deal. She's one of the best at Nova.
4.5,This was one of the most interesting classes I ever took. She is very relevant and knows how to relate to students well. If you attend class and turn in everything on time  you should get AT LEAST a B easily.
4,SHE WAS UNORGANIZED WHEN IT CAME TO KEEPING UP WITH MY GRADES. SHE HAD ERRORS IN HER GRADE BOOK  LUCKILY I KEPTTRACK OF EVERYTHING. SHE WAS CARELESS WHEN IT CAME TO MAKING THE CORRECTIONS  BUT SHE FINALLY DID. SHE CRITICIZED MY PAPER TOPICS AFTER I TURNED THEM IN EVEN THOUGH I CONSULTED WITH HER PRIOR TI THE DUE DATE.
5,Not an easy class - she has very high expectations  but you will learn a lot. She gives a lot of feedback on your papers which really does help you write better ones. She also bring in a lot of relevant material from art  music  film etc. Great discussions. She's Greeeat!
4,Great professor! you will have a lot of work and you really do have to read the book  but she's willing to help you. Essays were difficult  though.
3,GOOD TEACHER..DO YOUR WORK TRY YOUR BEST..SHE IS FAIR IN HER GRADING..THIS CLASS WILL BE HARD IF YOU ARE NOT GOOD AT WRITING PAPERS BUT IF YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH TO IMPRESS HER YOU'LL DO GREAT!
5,She really is great. Very clear  helpful and she'll work with you until however long you need it. She grades kind of tough  and has a lot of comments on your work  but after you get to know her style it's cake.
5,Simply one of the greatest. Drops all her work to attend to her students. Awesome.
5,Excellent Teacher
5,I like her a lot. She's very helpful.
3,No Comments
5,She is an awesome teacher. Took time away from her busy schedule to read over my essay and help me make some changes to it. She is a fair grader and an overall nice professor. If you have to take any type of writing or lit class take her.
5,Strick but fair
5,personal favorite
5,Very helpful. A terrific instructor!
5,Superior teaching style  much of the way I teach now is allotted to him.
2,The man is a total flake and a****to boot. Granted he knows what he's talking about  but watch you backs ladies.
5,Excellent professor.I learned a great deal in his class.I took him for one class but I still go to him all the time to ask questions.He has a passion for teaching and will go out of his way to help students who really try.Good professor to take if ur taking MCAT.Doesnt spoonfeed students.His class was rather challenging because he made me THINK.
5,Good professor. No doubt that he really knows Chemistry. He is however  fast paced and loves to hear himself talk. Participation in his class is not very encouraged and he enjoys humiliating students. He refers to himself as xe2x80x9cSkipxe2x80x9d  which is a little disturbing to say the least. Yet  he remains the best Chemistry professor at NSU in my opinion.
3.5,Online class. Contact with him sort of fizzeled throughout the semester
5,great teacher ...explains as much as he can..and helps a lot ..he knows his stuff and doesnt refer to his notes every two sec like giarikos..great sense of humor ..always there to help you ..make chem worth siting through ..for chem 1 i revolved my schedule aorund this mans class...i been with him 3 semesters and have great chem grades till now.:)
5,Not as bad as everyone makes him sound. Yes his class is hard but he challenges you. Available for extra help when you need him and offers a different teaching method which I found very effective
4,Great guy! Makes chem classes fun.
2.5,He needs to learn how to watch his mouth and teach so students understand.
2,I did not like him at all! I rather have a hard Shenbagh    than an easy Poemro.. I did not learn anything in Class!
2.5,"Tried hard  was geniunely nice guy  material was taught via ""think about it  it's obvious  all you have to do is visualize it"" which didn't work too well for me...but at least he cut us some slack and recognized that we tried....and passed us!"
5,He is an awesome professor who is willing to help his students. He is very passionate in teaching and understandable.
1,"Incredibly mean and heartless  constantly swears in class (""G-dammit""  ""this f-in thing here""  and more...). Just rude  crude and crass."
2,"He does tell you what questions are exactly going to be on the exams  thats why I did well in his class. He's unclear in his teaching so I just memorize what he writes. I honestly haven't learned much from him. He says ""it's easy  a third grader can understand this."" He's been teaching this course for many years so of course it's easy to him."
4,Mitra is very knowledgable in Math. One of the smartest Professors around. He does get little annoyed when students ask him questions from previous courses. He expects you to know everything. However  His reviews are similar to exams. So do ll the class problems and review  you should be fine! Not a real tough grader. Gives lot of partial Credit.
5,As always  he doesn't do much to mislead his students. He tests you on what he says he'll test you on  save for about 10-20 points of stuff that isn't on the review to see if you really learned anything and didn't just memorize the review. It is very easy to do well in his class and the graduate students love him.
1,His lectures are awful  take for an easy A not if you want to learn anything.
4,Gives partial Credits  You have to work very hard to get an A and F Easily passable
3.5,He is a bit rude  and gets annoyed when you ask for help. HOWEVER  his class is ridiculously easy. Show up for the reviews  get the test questions  and study that. He will teach you what you need to know  but only tests a narrow spectrum of the material. If you want a great grade  take him!
1,should avoid no help at help never get a chance to ask question
3.5,Good professor. Took him in the summer class. Exams are based on his reviews.
1.5,Mitra is very smart. With that said however  he's not very good at teaching. Expect to furiously write the examples HE solves on the board  leaving the class confused  and teaching yourself. There's no HW and there are 3 exams plus a final. He does drop the lowest grade of one of the regular exams. If you're not very good at math I'd say stay away.
3.5,I said with a 90 and above in my exams  'buddy' (my lowest grade was a 90...97 and a 92 in the final) ...I received an A. The departmental brought down my avg.
4,He's hard to understand when you first start the class  but then it gets easier. His tests are exactly the same questions he did in class and on the review day. You don't need the textbook.
2,i dont know how that buddy get an A with 90 my average grade on 3 exams are 89 but he still gave me B+ wht is that
3.5,"Great professor. Received an ""A"" w 90 and above on all 3 exam (drops the lowest grade)  not sure wht my departmental grade was but very linear. Show that you care & attend all classes (makes a key difference on if you're getting a ""B"" or ""A"") Exams (even the departmental) comes from his reviews-don't miss them. Go over h.w  class probs should b ok"
1,the worst and least helpful math prof i have ever meet drop it now5408
1,go to his clsss equal to learn by yourself....
1,why not let people rate him he is the worest prof ever
1,worst prof ever if u taking it  better drop it.
3,He is goofy  mistakes are goofy and his class is usually enjoyable. Go to class  take notes  go to review and you can ace his class. Very nice when it comes to grading and his exams are like the review. One of the best at Queens so far
3,It was very difficult to keep up but as long as you take good notes  you will be prepared for the exams.
5,He's a good professor  some people just misunderstand his intention because he does get annoyed easily but he doesn't mean any harm  also know who you're audience is every graduate student loves him(graduate center) but undergrad students who are bad at math don't like him.
4.5,She's a hottie!

3.5,fairly cool teacher  but really into ecology. Be warned  the ecology is mindless busywork  today we counted how many mealworms were being bred in a mound by hand-2300. But she is by far the best and easiest of all the lab teachers

4.5,Doc. Shreiber was my favorite prof. Took every class he taught. Played chess with him a few times. Taught me as much out of class as he did in class.
1,I took him for SS1.all we did was watch movies the whole time and then go home. The only test we had all SS1 was the final that was put together with by the students. He passed out a SGuide w/ the answers highlighted and that is exactly how the test was  spelling errors and all. I went to call about 8 times& made A+. Take him evertime you can!
1,Please take anyone but him. Have had him for 3 classes and he talks about the same things in all which have nothing to do with psychology! His lectures are pointless. His tests are ridiculously hard because he wants you to know everything like a professional but teaches none of it. Grades are random. Very unprofessional!!
4.5,He is a very easy professor. I do not think I ever made below an A. He did have some health complications recently. He was always helpful to me.
5,"Dr. S is getting a bad wrap. I must admit I graduated a few years ago now. Fact is the reason he gave up making class ""managed"" is because he got so many complaints about his class being to hard. It really broke his spirit. I am currently a Ph.D. student in neuroscience  and he prepared me well. You have to get on his level and listen."
2.5,PHYSIO--You don't need the book for any of his classes. He posts study questions online and if you memorize them you will know at least half or more of the test. He curves every test. You don't have to attend class but every time you do and he passes a roll sheet around you get a 1/3 of a bonus point added to your final grade. And he is hilarious.
1,Took him for Physio & Animal Bhvr. WORST TEACHER EVER! It is seriously a poverty to this school that they keep a man like this on their payroll. Example: he showed a video one class. Next class he says he was sorry  he showed the wrong one. He was there watching the whole video! Also  his review questions might as well be used on Mad Gab. AVOID!
1,he is the worst college professor I have ever come into contact with. He does an awful job of preparing you for your major. You will suffer in lack of knowledge if you take him. He does not teach
2.5,If you're a psyc major at UTT  you will have to take Dr. Schrieber for several classes. He is a very knowledgable professor  but has no pedagogic ability whatsoever. Granted you will make an A guaranteed  but you won't learn anything at all. Dr. Schriber may be a cool guy  but his classes are a total waste of time and money.
2.5,Dr. Schreiber is a very intelligent  funny man  but he has no teaching skills. He spends the whole semester talking about completely irrelevant topics. You will be required to learn the material on your own. His exams are extremely difficult  but it doesn't really matter since he curves them anyway. Total waste of time and money.
5,He's great.
1,"Worst professor I've ever had. His class was a waste of my time and my money! He never actually ""taught"" anything. He just went over possible test questions and gave you the answers every day. I will never take him again  and you shouldn't either if you actually want to learn."
2.5,All he does in class is go over what will be on the test. We get really long reviews  which end up being only half the test. It's just confusing. But if you study the reviews  you will do fine because he gives curves.
4,"I took Dr. Shreiber for l & c  he is a pretty good professor  but he does kind of ""ramble"". I thought I would dread the lab  but it was actually kind of fun. The tests aren't that bad  and the quizzes in lab are a ""joke""! You do have to read the book  and he does expect you to talk about the chapters in class! He was fun and kept it interesting!"
1,schreiber is AWFUL!!!! u never know whats going to be on his tests and he lectures about evolution and everything that is NOT on the test!!! its up to u to read all the chapters and figure out what the test will be. i DO NOT recommend him at all!!!!! STEER CLEAR!!!!
5,"this guy is great!!! great sense of humor in a class that should have an ""intro to l & c"" class. the reading is very very difficult  but there are certain fundamentals that the good doctor wants you to pick up. if you can grasp that concept  and make sure he gets the study guide to you  then you will have a good time. will take again."
4.5,I think Schreiber rocks! He's great  funny  and interesting if you keep up with the subject - read each chapter that is assigned - and show up for lab. He gives test study guides that are multiple choice and gives the answers to them I've passed all his test just by reading and going over the study guide. He's my favorite teacher so far
1,"The ""I don't teach  I profess"" bullcorn has been played out on me before I took this class"
1,AWFUL AWFUL  AWFUL teacher! Do not take him. Nice guy but a bad teacher. His lecture has nothing to do with the tests. ANd neither do the readings. On most tests the highest grade is a C. His tests come from random topics that students have never heard of. My favorite is when he said he was a professor so he is not hear to teach.

5,Her class is awesome. Attend class  do the work  try your best and you will do fine. Akk her classes are easy once you put in a lot of effort.
5,I love this teacher. She encourages everyone to know Chinese at basic level. She really cares about her students especially those who struggle. Attendance matters so don't miss out the fun.
3.5,She teaches simplified Chinese.So if u're a transfer student and your previous classes used traditional char then u've got two choices:(1)convert to simplified and relearn the words starting from ch 1 (no way jose)  or (2) continue with your traditional char but keep in mind that questions on exams and all class activities will be in simplied only.
3.5,If you don't know any of Chinese  then it would be very hard for you! the majority of this class are chinese or at least abc.....so...that's why they can get good grade from her
5,Took her for the summer. A great class and I learned a lot!
5,I loved her... she was the easiest and greatest teacher to have~ but for her class attendence does matter so!!!
2,the course is easy. he is not great he nit picks at little thing don't get on his bad side other then that he is fine. nothing special. notes are all over the pace just read the text do his assignments
1.5,No Comments
5,Great Teacher! Very clear on what he wants and will help you anytime on any of your assignments and answer any questions  even if its not related to the course. He's very passionate about what he teaches and concise and considerate about everyone in the class.
4.5,"Really nice guy  very willing to help you if you have any questions about the assignments and creates interesting class discussions. Just don't be late for class and say ""Thank You. P.S. He's kinda cute too."
1,Not a good teacher...This guy picks on you as well if he thinks you lack self esteem...He will pick on you on purpose just to impress the rest of the class..He thinks he is pretty hot too which makes me laugh.
4,Good teacher
4.5,Damn good teacher. Practices what he preaches. Whoever says he doesn't teach probably doesn't listen in class and likes to slack off. DUDE THATS ME and i still learnt so much. He made me want to learn. There's a lot of assignments but they're easy. Whoever says it isn't clear it's because youre DUMB and dont listen. Take him. but dont slack.
3.5,Brian is a great teacher who loves what he does and it shows. His notes were great and I found the lectures interesting and informative. Overall I found his classes very easy.
4,He's an ok instructor. Assignments are a bit confusing -- it's as if he's not even sure what he really wants from us. The assignments weren't all that useful  and he gave us way too much time in class to work on them.
2,Brian is a total joke. His notes were ???? and doesn't teach. before we knew it we had a midterm and no one in the class knew anything???r r it's an easy class though. you don't really need him to teach you very much. if you look at your manual and book you will do fine. the FLP is easy
1,Brian is a very bad teacher i would not recommend anyone talke his classes if they don't have to. He is very unclear and all over the map with his teaching.
4,looks like Lance Armstrong  lives like lance armstrong.......good role model  good class
5,inspirational teacher. very fair marker  makes class fun and interesting :)
2,he tells you one thing asks you to do it and then totally changes his mind. He isnt helpful in the least  im not a fan of him.
3.5,I can't believe he does not have a hot pepper cuz this instructor is hot stuff. He can teach too. Fun class and funny guy.
5,Excellent teacher  very fun and knowledgeable about course material and give extremely fair tests for the midterm and final. I really cant say anything bad about him as a professor  if you get a chance to take classes with him you wont regret it.
5,Great teacher  one of my favorites. He is super funny and entertaining. Plus you learn a lot.
5,the best sports science teacher
2.5,Fun Teacher but i found that he isnt always clear in what he was teaching and doesnt always give a straight answer but the class was fun.
4.5,Good teacher. His classes were alot of fun  and the text was interesting and useful. I enjoyed his class  and he was always upbeat and excited. I'd like to take anohter class with him in the future. Highly reccomended

1,Horrible
1,Awful.
1,not good at all
1,Absolutely Aweful!!! Uncooperative and unwilling to help students! Set in her ways and overdue for retirement!
4,She seems nice  but some of these posts make me wonder. Heard a terrible story about how the teacher I was observing let another kid who was observing him off for a day to take care of his sick girlfriend or something. Lasater found out  even though this teacher insisted the kid stay home  and he was booted out of the program. Ouch.
1.5,Past time to retire.
1,get serious!!!
1,She IS more concerned about appearances. She pretends to be nice and helpful  but if you want to do anything besides teach in the Rolla area  she will immediately turn her back on you. In 280  all the students used to talk about what we could do to get her fired - I don't know anyone who liked her  but we all pretended to so she would pass us.
1.5,She's a little outdated for an education teacher. Someone who was in the school system while dinosaurs were still on the earth should NOT still be teaching classes on education  in my humble opinion. That and she tends to be more concerned with appearances than with quality  so as long as you (and your papers) look cute you'll be fine.
4,Very sweet lady! Genuinely concerned about her students. Highly recommed!!!
5,Great teacher  sweet lady.
5,What a wonderful teacher! She goes out of her way to be helpful to every student all the time. I am very impressed with the quality of her instruction and the depth of her involvement with her students.
4,"I had her back in 1998  in night school. Definetely a ""people person"""
4.5,Very thorough. Impressive knowledge of the subject matter (HR Administration). Reading load and difficulty of quizzes were higher than other HR courses. Still  a good learning experience. Took the time to read and make comments on written work.
5,EASY CLASS! Tries to make the subject interesting but doesn't have much success. Its just a boring subject to work with. Cares about his students a lot and is ALWAYS willing to help if needed.
4.5,"He is the definition of an ""effective teacher""! Very willing to help and is understanding. The material is a little boring (and his PowerPoints get kind of old)  but if you study what he tells you to (it WILL be on the test) you'll do fine. Excellent class discussions!"
5,Tuff couse and kinda dry. He did the best he could with the subject.
5,The professor is very knowledgeable. He is making a dry subject somewhat interesting.
5,Sooooooooooooo knowledgeable. Very personable too. His classes are fun because you learn  but also feel comfortable in expressing disagreement with him. Wish he taught all my education classes.
3.5,He kind of trails off when he talks  not that a lot of what he says is important to take down. Gave us his powerpoints and the tests were open book/note  but you had to voice your opinion on those as well. Just go on about how important children are to you.
2,This class was horrible. I would not recommend it to anyone.
5,I enjoyed going to class. His teaching environment was conducive to learning and he made you feel welcome and important  not just a student to pour information into.
4.5,Such a good professor. I loved going to class because his reactions are hilarious. Class was very fun and he really does want everyone to pass. Just make sure to understand all the examples he gives in class and you'll do well.
4,I took Gao for Calculus I over Summer 2013. He was very helpful and cared to explain my mistakes without asking him. He seems to choose material purely out of care to prepare us for harder classes. I had some trouble listening to his lecture  but overall his communication was excellent. I definitely recommend taking him for a semester!
4.5,Gao is a tough cookie. He has an accent and tends to be very lazy when executing problems for the class  but I enjoyed his class. He assigns weekly homework  weekly quizzes  THREE midterms  and ONE comprehensive final(worth twice of a midterm). He will try to trick you on some of his quizzes  but the midterms and final are chosen from HW questions
3,Professor Gao can be lazy at times but overall his class is somewhat easy. He has a heavy accent so it is difficult to understand him at times. He's a lenient grader. There are four exams(final included) and like 10 quizzes. Overall  if you can avoid him  avoid him
4.5,He is a really helpful professor. He wants students to succeed. He does have a strong accent  but once you are in class and listening to him it's easy to ignore. Definitely one of the most caring and considerate professors at CSULB.
4,Pros: Really cares and tries to helpful  very funny jokes  makes calculus a little more interesting Cons: thick Chinese accent (easy to understand if you're used to Asian accents)
4.5,Great teacher! This is exactly what you need to do to pass his class: Do all the homework  write down all the examples  All three exams come from the hw and example  test are easy if you study the hw and examples  quizes every week lets you use notes. Take him hes great  im not the smartest person and i got an A.
3,Gao is nice enough but the class seemed a bit disorganized - no schedule or class assignments listed ahead of time. The book sucks and is chock full of errors. Despite this  I did well in the class. Ignore Gao's laugh or statements of how easy everything is. He will help you during office hours and is usually pretty good in clarifying concepts.
4,His lectures are a bit confusing  it's easier to just study on your own. But he is a VERY lenient grader. Quizes are open book and tests are pretty straight forward. Not too bad
4,"Quotes:""COME ON  IT'S EASY"" ""PLUG THIS GUY  THIS GUY IN !!"""
4,Excellent Professor! I think his thick accent might be discouraging on the first day  but you'll pick up on it. Tests are easy  and he's a nice grader. The class was very interesting  and he clearly cares about his students! In the end  a pleasant experience overall! Would definitely take him again!
2,1. He has an accent  most will understand what he is saying  but there will be a lot of times where he says something that sounds like gibberish. 2. Helpful? Not so much 3. Guaranteed A? No  it's a math class  you're either good at it or not. If you're in between.. it all depends on how well you can understand him/the book. 4. Highschool like class
3,Very sweet professor. He knows math analysis like the back of his hand. His tests are not difficult at all. He includes 1 proof ? on his tests which I think is unfair because a lot of non math majors are required to take the class. Smart professor with an accent but it doesnt effect lectures. He cuts slack for the programming quizzes every week
1,Dr. Gao was without a doubt one of the worst professors I've ever had. He is extremely difficult to understand and doesnt seem to care. He also has great difficuly properly answering questions.
3.5,HARD TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE OF HIS ACCENT  GOES OVER MATERIAL REALLY FAST  I DIDNT FEEL LIKE I WAS PREPARED FOR THE TESTS  HE IS A REALLY NICE GUY THO AND HE SOMETIMES JUST GIVES EVERYONE 100 % ON THE QUIZZES WHEN WE DONT UNDERSTAND IT  SOMETIMES DOESNT COLLECT HOMEWORK AND GIVES EVERYONE POINTS FOR DOING IT
3.5,This teacher is cool! Has an accent while speaking  but in time it's easy to catch on. He's a real nice guy that helps all his students  & cares about them. He's laid back  and goofy. I enjoyed his class...it made finite math  not so boring. His tests aren't too bad either..if you understand the homework you'll do fine.
4,Hard class for the graduate students  even more torturous for the undergraduates. Horrible book-- both book and Gao expected a lot of prior knowledge  but he's very helpful as long as you ask. Go to his office or ask him quetsions in class. Good Luck!
4.5,Good class. He goes through material quickly  but if you go to class everyday and pay attention you'll so fine. Computer Labs are not that big of a deal since all the programs are already written.
3.5,Very very hard to understand due to his accent. So if you arent a math wiz  it will be very hard for you to learn and pass the class.
3,Hard to understand  but it's math and he writes it on the baord so it's ok. Teaches the subject well  and he's kinda goofy so it makes class interesting. good teacher overall
4.5,Doc is a fantastic professor. It's obvious how much he loves jazz. He plays favorites for sure  but if you prove yourself to him as a musician  he'll have more faith in you.
2,What a ass. If you can  avoid this guy. He's only interested in himself and doesn't give a crap about the student. Tenure is a horrible thing.
5,ensemble rocked  he gave us music that was a challenge and really pushed us musically. Jazz history is a cake walk if you only hold a minor interest. Amazing musician for a stiff morman. Doc is awesome
1,No Comments
5,"Doc is awesome. The man seems so bland on the surface  but every once in a while  he'll say something that'll just shock you (i.e. ""eat the elephant in small bites"")"
3.5,"Nice guy yeah  understanding...not so much. Lost an assignment I spent 5 hours on...""too bad  that's technology"". Has an interest  but not enough to keep me awake at 8am!"
1,I HATE HIM! He is vague and boring! All of his assignments were complete jokes and he had no idea how to explain even the simplist concepts. NEVER take a class with him. He is so unclear that I can't even begin to describe
5,great guy i mean it funny too
5,Doc is awesome  who would say otherwise? He's helpful and very nice. He cares about student progress and gets excited when students make improvements. He's just a cool jazz man.
4.5,First  don't be late. Second  remember to take notes. Questions on the exams are based on his notes. 1 short term paper and 1 freakin' easy map test. HOWEVER  the mid-term and the final exam are so difficult and tricky ... He's nice and gentle with a little bit accent of Polish. You'll pass his class but won't be able to get a high grade like A
5,Excellent professor. Always willing to help. His tests are a little tough  but he is very easy with grading everything else and gives a lot of credit for in class participation.
5,I don't know what kind of student wrote the previous comment  but what he said is NOT true. This professor has a wonderful personality  he's very helpful (JUST ASK!!!)  his lectures are very clear. Yes  the midterm was harder than I thought... However  I definately learned A LOT in his class!!!
2,A very nice guy but so boring. too much reading per night  20 dreadful pages and more. tries to trick us. midterm was hard intentionally so people will drop his class  final review was given but final was too tricky. easy paper to write. sarcastic rude and does help students. i felt that i shouldnt gotten a high grade.
5,I wasn't so interested in history until I took this professor. There is no reason not to pull off an A as long as you take good notes
4,This guy is something! He will make you either laugh  or cry. The Map exam is easy  the other 2 I guess too  cause if you read book and notes u'll be fine. Just know the stuff he assigned for the particular day.
4.5,he's a really great teacher- actually very interesting for such a potentially boring topic but his tests are murderous and he's a tough marker- highest grade was a B on the midterm and in the end the curve was not so great  also very understanding with papers will proofread papers before grading and give a chance to do better  only problem is tests
4.5,great  just get notice and your on your way to an easy A
5,Great Professor  Three tests  all Easy  one paper  real simple. always willing to help you out  Great in every aspect!!!
4.5,I've just finished his class. It was difficult but very interesting. His personality is fantastic. He seems to love what he is doing.
3.5,If you pay attention and take notes  anyone can pass it. If you have hard time paying attention and need to be guided every step of the way  then take somebody else.50% of the work is on your own  but he will help out.
5,Just took the map test and got 100. One more test and one final. They are not cummutive
4.5,IT ALL DEPENDS IF YOU WANT TO TAKE 5 MINUTES TO READ FROM THE BOOK AS WELL AS THE CLASS NOTES. THERE IS NOTHING NEW THAT YOU HAVE NOT SEEN BEFORE. TRY TO GET NOTICE WITH QUESTIONS AND STUFF LIKE THAT.
4.5,I had a very good time in his class. The discussions were great. He has a fantastic and sharp sense of humor. The tests and the final easy if you pay attention.
2,Hes a nice guy but boring as all Hell! He put me to sleep each day & the semester dragged.He lectures (which is BORING) & doesnt have a good method of teaching.I wouldn't recommend him to anyone unless you can read & comprehend the info on your own & pass.
4,he seems a little unfriendly during class  but when you speak to him after class  he's a great guy and very understanding  if you work hard and participate in class it is easy to do well  his tests are straightfoward and he gives you a review sheet  i wish all prof. were like him
4.5,He is a very good professor. look if you got problems (like i did) just speak to him after class  explain the issue  participate in class discussions  do your job and you will have a good great. But work hard.
4,easy prof.  agree with previous posts that he tends to ramblre and is a bit unorganized  but overall pretty easy and gives good grades  and he gives a review sheet for final and test  also lets you hand in paper early to discuss with him  nice and laid back  easy to do well and get an A
3.5,pretty nice guy  very opinionated but he hears out everyone and is pretty reasonable. knows his stuff and the class discussions are pretty good. If you know the material you'll do fine.
5,He knows the material very well and adds many interesting details. You will enjoy his class.
3,Weird  weird guy. The class was presented so dryly. The class was nothing more than okay. Optional homework. No quizzes. Just the exams that come with study guides that contain I would say about 90%+ of the material that will be on exam. He explains things well  but has weird rules like no use of laptops in class.
1.5,HE DOESNT SEEM TO CARE ABOUT THE STUDENTS
1,I had Mr Glennon last year. This teacher cannot teach. I studied the book for hours and when I didn't understand something  he would refer me to the book  if he said anything at all. If you care about your GPA  avoid this teacher. This is the only class I've ever recieved a D+ in and I studied ALOT. He's pretty mean and doesn't care about the class
1,Hands down worst math teacher i have EVER had. Argued with students. Condescending and bizarre. There were four huge 'quizzes' which more resembled a midterms. no review of material. hwk assignments and class examples do not match quiz/final questions. V RUDE MAN STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS. DROP IT. REPEAT AVOID GLENNON.
1.5,"Terrible. Just god awful. I have always understood math but this man just ruined it for me. ""Quizzes"" are huge and don't even go along with the homework.. No matter what  avoid this teacher. He's extremely rude and talks down to his students. Overall just a mean guy"
1,This guy walks around with his 1960s hair-du  doesnt know right from wrong  gives no chance to those who fight for their grade. Avoid him at all costs...I'd rather go hooked on phonics then to be taught by this teacher.
1.5,I tried so hard to adhere to this man's ridiculous teaching style but ended up getting screwed on his his 12 page quizes. He does not even assign that much homework. If enrolled in his class  read the entire book multiple times and do every homework assignment expecially the ones he does not assign.
2,This is a difficult class with a very difficult professor. He tends to get defensive and a little condescending when asked a question. He doesn't grade on a curve and almost everyone in the class was failing. You really do need to attend class regularly and be disciplined enough to do the homework if you want to get a C- or better.
1,"If your quiz grade hits rock bottom and ask him for help  he'll only tell you to ""do better next time"" and ""do your homework"" without giving any constructive opinions or actual assistance. Aviod him as he's a suicidal bomber for your grade. The only good thing is attendance is not mandatory since attending his lecture or not makes no difference."
1,DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! All his notes are word by word from the book. Not helpful at all. Assigns a lot of homework and then doesn't know how to answer questions about it.
3.5,Well I got an A in 125 and I wouldn't recommend this teacher. I recommend someone else.Graded on 4 exams (he drops one)and the final. If you need to take 126 and there is no else to take  just wait a quarter and take someone else. He goes over the material well  but the tests are 10x harder. Not recommended.
1.5,WOW all this guy did was read the standard PowerPoints. All the material was online. Kept you till 9pm then took attendance. Was confused about some of the powerpoints stating that they were wrong. Abused the software on the school machines showed a girls email to everyone. Everyone in class ended up teaching themselves.
3,Look im gonna be 100% honest...hes kind of weird yes. but hes a pretty good prof...his ability to teach is not what makes this class suck..its his ability to grade..he is an EXTREMELY hard grader and requires every decimal point to be correct..as other users stated..his tests are 10x harder then material.if your not bad at math take.otherwise avoid
3.5,4 exams throughout the quarter w/ the lowest score dropped then a final exam. Weight was 50/50 between the 3 exams and final if the average of the 3 was higher than the final. If the final exam grade was higher than the 3 then its 20% for the 3 exams and 80% for the final. I walked into the final with a 73% average. Got an A- in the class.
2.5,I agree his tests are totally harder than what he teaches in class and the homework he gives us.
3.5,He can teach the material. Alright teacher over all. Attendance is optional  h/w is not graded nor collected  and grade comes from best grade of 3 out of 4 tests for 50%  and final for 50%.
3.5,good teacher  clear and and if you work hard you'll get the material. ture that he's kid of weird but lets face it  no one's perfect. gives 4 quiz that counts for 50% of over all grade and drops the lowest of the 4 so the top three best would be counted.
3.5,Very straightforward. Easy class  no homework required. Stay up on homework to get a good grad though. 4 tests throughout the class. Tests include the midterm and final.
1,He is insane  who cares if he has issues with himself. He should not take it out on us ! I'll bet money he's the one who posted those last two comments about himself. Please seek help Glennon and get the hell out of DePaul ........**** !
1,Mr. Glennon does not help his students. I don't know what these two posts below me are talking about. they are trying to trick you to join the class  because their is always so many open seats in his class. Glennon uses his students  and constantly uses bias's against students he does not like. Glennon is a predator  STAY AWAY.
5,Gives out lots of homework  but makes the subject matter super interesting. Has flexible office hours and is willing to answer any questions you have. It's nice to see someone so passionate about what they teach. Textbooks aren't too expensive for her May Term class.
4.5,One of the most genuinely nice and caring ladies i've ever met. Cares about the well-being of her students and how they are doing in the class. Yes  she is a difficult grader  but she makes you a MUCH better writer! Go to her office hours  show up to class  and turn things in on time and you should have no problem getting a high B or A.
3,Took her voodoo class  that was an experience. She assigns several 3-5 page essays throughout the course an a research paper for a final. She is nice  but a little crazy  she gets very excited about slavery without taking into account the ethnicity of her students. Lectures make an interesting subject incredibly boring. Not my major but got an A.
5,Women  Religion  and Spirituality was one of the best classes I took my freshman year. She is very sweet and insanely intelligent. The classes include almost exclussively women  but she really cultivated an interest in the subject for those not expecting to like it. This is a great gen ed to take to fulfill your CSI and Global Diversity flagsl.
4,Intro to Myths and Rituals is one of my favorite classes. Prof. Myscofski is fair  engaging and knows what she is talking about. *Spoiler Alert* We watched Star Trek in class. Whether you're interested in the topic or not  she presents the material well and the assignments are manageable.
5,Professor Myscofski is great! She's very scholarly and professional  but also fun to talk to. She's very understanding and flexible if there's a problem with one of your assignments  and she's more than willing to work with you to help you succeed in her class.
2.5,she's a sweet lady  knows her stuff. but boy is she tough. spend hours and hours writing an essay  go in and ask her about it  have friends read it and get a b-. that's crap. many people dont like her class and find it boring. only a passion for the subject area can get you through the readings.
4.5,She has a great knowledge of the subject and is a very kind professor. It was an amazingly interesting course. Paper assignments were difficult though and she is a tough grader. But if you enjoy the material  it is definitely worth taking a course from her.
1,"tough on papers  avoided ""difficult"" discussions (sex  etc. ALL the interesting stuff) b/c she was afraid of the awesome  exciting stuff we oculd have said. awful for women's studies  other subjects i hear she's better."
5,I LOVE CAROL! she made me laugh. she tells you exactly what she wants from yuo in papers and that's really all she wants! she's very straight forward about grading!
5,Excellent teacher. Tries to scare you in the beginning-don't let her do it-stick it out and it is not as tough as you think. just do the work-which is not that tough and you will get an A
3.5,She's wonderful! She's an easy grader if you give her what she wants. As long as you follow the assignment  you'll be fine. It's obvious to see that she knows what she's talking about and her enthusiasm comes through her lectures. I would definatly take her class over again!
4,"She's alright although I didn't like some of the biases she showed in class. It was always ""religion says women are bad and men are dominant  blah  blah  blah"". It got old after a while but the course is easy. She also offers extra credit opport"
3.5,"all i have to say is ""eh."" Take a class with her if you like the topic or need the credit. She's not too bad  not too good."
4.5,CM is great  she loves her studies and it shows. Class is always lively. She is tough on grading though so make the effort in your writings.
4.5,This class is a must for everyone. It is wonderful and eye opening. She is a hard grader on papers...so make sure you work on them ahead of time and have her check them for you. However..she is very passionate about the topic  and teaches well
4.5,Every person should take her women's studies course....it's easy  fun  and informative. She is really passionate about it. You'll be surprised how much you learn. TAKE IT!
2.5,No Comments
3,Not a bad teacher. He pissed everyone off when he said he was giving us all extra credit  I had totalled up quite a bit  then one day came in to class and said he was giving us none and laughed about it.
5,very innovative and smart teacher. Good kooking too
5,Had Nancy for plant physiology around 1986 and still remember her class. What a great teacher. The reviews that say she plays favorites are absolute garbage. Warm  enthusiastic  friendly  supportive. Clear  understandable lectures. Hard exams. Excellent.
2.5,Lectures were horrible. Prefer reading the text than to keep up with her. She keeps us in class way over lecture time. C'mon  we have other classes to attend!! Not Very Good...
3,Agree with others. She favors some students over others. Her lectures are clear  but not exactly like the book. She goes into details with her experiences and knowledge. It is good sometimes  but bad when it's not relevant to exactly what to study for the exams. Overall  an average professor.
4.5,very clear lectures  you can tell professor enjoys teaching her subject and wants students to do well
3,condescending  willing to help at a certain point. Her lectures are very clear and straight forward that is about the only redeeming charactersisitcs  favors certain students over others
4.5,No Comments
2.5,No Comments
2.5,Has her favorites  her lectures are excellent  she can be a bit condescending
4.5,Going in for office hours is very helpful. She is a very friendly professor  and enthusiastic about biology. In depth analysis of the chemistry involved in biology. Occassional extra credit pop quizzes. Highly recommended.
4,nothing you cant handle
5,nan is a great lecturer. she really tries to get you to understand the material before she moves on. near the end of the semester though  it was a little rushed. she's enthusiastic. her exam questions are pretty easy if you understand and review the material. she really cares about her students.
5,One of the best professors I have ever had.I wish more professors can be like her.Her enthusiasm for the material and her desire to see her students succeed is evident to anyone who talks to her. In sum: A great professor
5,It's obvious she has a passion for the material--even if her students do not. She is a good lecturer and really takes an interest in seeing that her students do well--just as long as you make the effort to take advantage of her helpfulness.
5,Nan was one of the most helpful teachers I have ever had. She went out of her way to make sure I passed the class.
5,I had her as an undergrad and a grad student. She is very knowledgeable and very helpful. Haven't seen her for a few years  but she was sure nice on the eyes too!
5,No Comments
4,Great professor. He is nice and really knows his stuff. He also has had so much experience in traveling the world and loves to tell stories (all relevant to the work being done in class).
2.5,He looks kind of like a young einstein! He was a good guy  really nice and very passionate about his material but I didn't know what was going on half the time. He talked about a lot of stuff that had nothing to do with lecture. I was ready to be out of that class!
1.5,He is weird and very animated... he doesn't say much and sticks to his own opinion- no one else's matters. The TAs were more educational.
4.5,The most incredible man. He is an inspiration.
1,He is probably one of the worst teachers I have ever had. His lectures were boring. He rambled about irrelevant issues and if you went to see him in his office he acted like you were wasting his time. I did okay in his class  but he was almost hateful towards me and made the class unpleasant.
3.5,No Comments
4,I was never open to non-Western Lit but his enthusiasm and knowledge of the subject made me want to learn more and I enjoyed it.
5,if you think that he is egotistical or hard you should drop out now. b/c you have no hope of coming up with an original concept on your own. and saying that he doesnt let you have your own opinions is catagorically incorrect  that is exactly what he tries
5,would almost go back to school to take a class of his again. best there is.
5,"Fitz is a cool guy! We called him ""Wolfman Jack"" because of that hoary mane of his! Those who think he is egotistical or has some crazy agenda are morons! His only interest is in furthering the abilities of his students! He was one of the most memorable  knowledgable  and interesting professors I have ever had the priviledge of studying under."
2.5,it was hard to understand what Fitz was talking about but it was a fun class if you enjoy reading alot of books. it is pretty much your TA who grades you  not Fitz
2,He's an automaton that spits out postmodern buzzwords with enthusiasm. He will relate to you his experience chatting with Derrida  whom  along with Foucault  seem to be his intellectual idols. Nice guy  but the intellectual atmosphere he's trapped in will make any class a terrible experience.
1,I was pretty interested in this class before i took it but this one spoiled it all for me. He is very egotistical. Has his own agenda and will stick to it and will not let you explore your own ideas. Avoid him if you can. You will regret taking this class. It is helpful in NO way at all. A waste
1,HORRIBLE...HORRIBLE...HORRIBLE...egotistical know-it-all
3,Overall he was energetic and interesting to listen to even though many of his theories are far-fetched. Pertaining to the course  his lectures dont really do much for you because the tests are essays over your opinions over themes in books.
5,The most interesting class I've ever taken and definitely the most interesting prof. Cares about the subject and students deeply. He's also really fun in class- sometimes acts out the stories
5,Two classes with Fitz. Great teacher and fun lectures. He really pulls the class into the lecture and discussion. Great guy and works with you.
5,Took 2 years of classes with Fitz. He is wonderful  exciting  and has a sexy head of hair!!!
5,very funny  enthusiastic  a bit excitable... always interesting  and has a passion for readings.. big O'Brien fan  as am I  now that I've taken the course...
4.5,The reading assignments are sometimes boring  but Professor Fitz always explains and is extremely nice and helpful. He is very cute when he's reading to us  because he gets very excited and into the story.
3,Boring books  boring class  not enough student involvement. She talks for majority of class. Difficult quizes and expects a bit much. Avoid.
1,The class is really boring  she talks to fast and never explains what she wants from you. A lot of reading and writing in this class. Be prepared for her to tear your paper apart  she over analyzes everything. She is definitely not a fair grader.
3,The class really isn't that hard  though the books she chooses are boring. She's kind of ditzy though  and can be boring at times  but she is a fair grader.
5,She requires a lot from the students. A lot of reading and writing even for a regular comp lit class. However  she is very nice and is a fair grader.
3.5,Reaquires too much writing for a 101 class that is not even a writing intensive class.
2.5,Extremely boring  give a lot of tests and reading... has the ability to talk to herself in a class where everyone else is sleeping
1,No Comments
1,If you don't agree with this professor you are guaranteed to fail. The teaching of this course is not based on reality. I agree ... dreadful course!
1,"I graduated 7 years ago. I respect her determination  yet be honest: You can't disagree with her if you want to do well. She simply won't give contract credit unless your ""opinions"" match her own. I know of MANY including myself who wrote lies f"
1,No Comments
4.5,This prof has tremendous personal experience and willingness to share it. While we do not always agree  she has my respect for believing and doing what she feels is right. Those who would criticize should walk just one measly little mile in her shoes.
1,Go out and work in the field before telling other show to teach.
1.5,Dreadful...Absolutely dreadful course.
4,"Very hard  but a good teacher. Accent  but not too bad-- says ""right"" too much. Sometimes absent during his office hours  but otherwise these were useful."
3,He was an okay professor. I agree there was really no point to go to lectures  and most of the teaching was done in section. If you can learn from the book  then he's not that bad  otherwise having a good TA helps  I had Jeanine Batterton  she was really helpful and I highly recommend her.
2,i quit going to class and thats when i actually started learning...what does that say?
1,DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! Lectures were completely useless  and make you feel so lost! You are better off skipping them and using the time for learning the material on your own...completely useless professor.
1.5,QC is a terrible lecturer. He's so boring and all I did was go on my ipod touch the whole time. He's really nice outside of class though. Tests are so annoying but I ended up getting and A in the class because I did really well on the final. Avoid him. Compared to other 103 profs he's much harder.
3.5,"""QC"" can be difficult to follow in lecture occasionally. Quantum is definitely his specialty. But he is a nice intelligent guy  is organized and helpful when you ask. His tests and expectations are very fair (all MC  ~70% average) If you can use the book well or have a good basic knowledge of chem  don't worry about it  you'll do fine."
3,Q.C. is a nice guy who doesn't explain concepts the best. However he does try to answer questions and he is approachable. The exams can be somewhat difficult  but if you read the book  you should be fine since the class average on exams is around 70%. I would recommend him if you are able to understand just by reading the textbook.
1,SWITCH PROFESSORS NOW! QC is an intelligent person  but he cannot teach this material AT ALL. Lectures are absolutely useless. Read the book and pray.
2.5,Bad professor for Chem 103!! DO NOT take this course from QC. He is BRILLIANT  but can not teach the fundamentals of chemistry. He wants to be teaching Quantum stuff  NOT what an element  atom  or molecule is!
2,Lectures are often confusing. Reading the book is basically essential to getting a good grade. Exams are ok  but you can't get partial credit as they are multiple choice (good and bad).
2,he is horrible
3,Cui isn't a bad guy at all. He clearly has knowledge but can't dumb him self down to teach 103. Exams are not that bad. I got an AB on the first two and an A on the third exam. Unfortuneately there's no curve  but he does make a reasonable scale  as an 85% and up will be an A (depending on class average) which he wants to be a B.
2.5,Unable to teach chem 103. A lot of people in my section stopped attending lecture all together because it is just so completely useless. He seems to mention the key concepts in lecture  but forgets to explain and teach the main concepts. Better hope for a great TA!
1.5,"Professor Cui ""Q.C."" is very unclear in lecture and is incapable of completely answering questioins. I would reccommend NOT taking his class. Exams are not curved. If you are unfortunate enough to have him  pray you have a good T.A.! I reccommend Brian Parker."
1.5,Horrible! As said early  he is unable to dumb himself down to teach 103. He may be better to teach higher level chem classes  quantum chem is obviously his passion  but he is a TERRIBLE teacher for 103! He never explains things thoroughly and his tests are extremely difficult and then he's confused when many students fail!
1.5,"Absolutely useless. Seriously  he should stick to research. I am barely staying afloat in a subject I have no interest in because I have a decent TA  but if you're not so lucky be prepared to teach yourself chemistry. Btw  I counted 250 ""Rights"" in one of his most recent lectures. . Keeps you awake in lecture. . ."
2.5,good guy. doesn't explain concepts well.
2,"Good guy  but a horrible CHEM 103 professor. He does not tie concepts together. I wouldn't recommend him to future students. Brilliant man  but unable to ""dumb things down."""
1.5,Probably the worst teacher I've ever had.
2.5,He was not very helpful and is not recommended as a teacher for Chem 103
5,Professor Malitsky is an excellent teacher for trigonometry. The way she teaches is easy to follow and is and I am able to follow up with the lecture easily in the textbook. She does not take short cuts in demonstrating problems  which I like  because the little math errors are easy to miss with shortcuts.
5,A very empathetic instructor  she pays attention to questions and feedback. She wants you to succeed. Do your best and you'll be fine.
4,This professor was amazing at explaining how to derive the equations she was teaching us. She not only explained why we needed to learn the material but applied it to real life. If you've ever had officer hours with her  you'll find she truly wants you to learn the material and will help you in any way she can.
1,Mrs. Malitsky does not explain anything in class  just teaches out of the textbook word for word. The exams are ridiculously hard and the examples in the class lecture and homework do not help you prepare for them. Unless you're a math genius and know what you're doing I wouldn't recommend taking this class.
2,Professor Malitsky was helpful with homework classes during lectures  but her lectures were verbatim from the textbook. So when I attended lectures  I did not need to read from the textbook. I did the minimum work for the class and scored the highest score on the final. The material isn't hard  but the teacher is a little boring. But  she is nice.
3,Professor Malitsky's lectures are read straight out of the textbook but she doesn't cover everything in the required textbook so  if you go to class  you don't need to read the textbook. I would suggest going to class because she does help with the online homework assignments. Not a bad professor  but her Polish accent takes a while to get used to.
1,Professor Malitsky is not a very effective teacher. There is no discussion section for this class and all her lectures are problems straight out of the book. She is also not friendly at all. All of the exams that go along with this class are a lot harder than any examples she does in lecture and are very hard to be well prepared for.
5,Incredible teacher  has a great sense of humor  and a true sense to ensure her students are learning material. Curves and other grades are very fair  but you have to work for your grade.
2,Long boring lectures and exams that don't accurately represent what was taught in the homework  as well as in lecture. However  the exams are heavily curved.
2,this class is unnecessarily hard because I knew that some of the ways we were taught could be much easier just by explain a different way to solve it. I felt like she chose the hardest  most challenging way to solve every single problem and that was the way we had to learn how to solve it. This class could have been much easier.
3,Teacher does not realize when students do not understand and just ends up moving on to another problem or example I feel like there is no such thing as time to sit  rest  and think about what we just learned-there is no break time it is just go  go  go and if you aren't listening intently for even 5 seconds you will miss a great deal of information
2,Lectures are not interesting  and she goes through the textbook word for word and does all of the textbook example problems. She takes homework questions and works out all of the problems you ask her to. The exams are much more difficult than the content she actually teaches.
2.5,She's at times difficult to understand with her accent  but after a while you get used to it and her accent's not too big of a problem. All she does is read the book word for word. She rushes through the problems as if we should understand them already. She does help with homework once a week  which is helpful.
1,I did not like this class! WAY too hard for a basic math class. Lectures were SO boring and confusing  she just did problems the whole time which didn't help me. Definitely the worst class and probably worst professor I've had at UW so far. Seems like a nice lady  but tests were SO HARD  and were nothing like her practice tests.
1.5,I was left sitting in lectures looking around and wondering if I was on a different planet.....a pointless waste of time. Tests were completely different than homework  quizzes  and pass exams. I feel I did not lean anything and it therefore set me up for failure in math for the rest of my life.
3,Super boring  super dull. You really don't need to go to class except when there's an exam. Everything else is literally straight from the book
4,To do well on exams you have to know the concepts well. She does a good job of explaining in lecture and provides good examples. She's a very straightforward professor and the exams are fair.
3,Nearly everything she does in class appears to be taken right from the textbook. She teaches by simply doing example after example and doesn't really explain the concept by talking but rather does lots of examples in order for you to understand which wasn't bad. If you study the tests and quizzes can be quite easy.
2.5,I struggled at first with Math 114 but quickly learned what she wanted. Do the homework twice (once a few days before the quiz and the night before  trust me it's worth it). The midterm & final questions are kind of odd. You get to use a sheet of notes on the midterms& finals. Overall  not a bad professor but not a great one.
2.5,Not even worth it to go to lecture. She simply does the exercises and problems from the book and does extensive  pointless proofs. I found it easier to just read the textbook and teach myself. Pray for a good TA.
1,Totally unhelpful and difficult to reason with. Overall very poor quality professor. Very disappointing considering the high quality of Seneca College's other professors.
4.5,She was a very good and a kind teacher. She used to communicate with the students very well  and is a good teacher to take for any psychology courses.
4,Good teacher  but hard marker. If you take an online course with her  do not slack off  cause you will get a D or Fail. Do the assignments on time and you will be fine.
5,"... oops  i meant ""She's an excellent teacher"" not ""She's an excellent course."" lol"
5,What are you people talking about? She's an excellent course and an easy marker. I learned many cool new things in her class. You'll do well if you do your research and always check essay/paragraph structure  grammar and spelling before handing something in.
3,I took the online course so i don't know what she's like in person  but as far as i got to know her i can say that she was willing to help and made the course requirements quite clear. She was really tough on marks. Overall  i'd say she's OK.
5,Dr. Heller is one of the best professors I had during my study at Seneca College. She is an icon Seneca should be proud of. Ramin Keshani
1,If you have her on your timetable  you'd better be dropping the course or change b4 it's too late.
2,if you white she wont' help you...and what college prof marx 4 attendance?
2,She has an obsession with being awkward  but I guess she is ok.
1,Courses taught are very boring and structured poorly. You'd learn more alone.
3.5,Too hard of a marker
3,"your lessons were outdated by atleast a decade  please do some ""real research"""
3,marks for attendance.... weak!!

4.5,very hard marker  but you will learn alot  excellent teacher!
1.5,No Comments
1,complete idot and ****  Should be out of here
3,Went through lectures too fast. Funny teacher  tough grader. Half the class is gone midway into the semester. NEED TO DO HW AND ATTEND TUTORING.
1,Prof. goes though lectures extremely quick and easily left behind if. Test were extremely hard  and hard to understand.
4,She teaches very fast  but if you attend all of her lectures you will be fine. For her stat 108 class  there are 3 quizzes  3 tests and then a final. Be sure to review your tests/quizzes to make sure they were graded correctly because her TA this year marked several things wrong that were not. Overall  she is very funny and tries to make it fun.
3,She's a funny professor and will make you laugh  but her teaching skills aren't good. She moves really fast and doesn't cover all the material you see in the textbook. Her grading is really strict. If you take this class consider going to tutoring for extra help.
2,The worst math teacher I've ever had. Her tests are insanely hard and your grades are solely based on that. She's picky when it comes to grading. Tries to be funny and relatable. Don't skip class or you won't know anything
1,Really bad at explaining things. Rude when you ask for help even during office hours
5,Love Dr. Kim Park she is very straight to the point. There are ABSOLUTELY NO SURPRISES in her class. Very nice grader too! Surprisingly a funny professor too you just have to catch her in the right moment! Doesn't use text. Homework is online. Very prompt grader I was worried about this class but she made it very basic and easy to understand!
5,Dr. Kim Park teaches EXTREMELY fast. She is willing to go over problems multiple times (with a little sass) till you get it. She is available during office hours and is helpful there too. Exams are straight forward and mostly from the notes/homework  no surprises. She's also really relatable. 3 exams  1 final  homework. 500 pts. Provides formulas.
2,3 tests & 3 quizzes. She teaches very fast  but as long as you go over your notes again you should be fine. I got an A on every quiz and test. You do not need the textbook. The example problems she gives during class are very similar to the ones on the tests and quizzes. You need her notes to do well  so go to class. Class is 500 points total.
3,Her tests are tough but luckily she curves. Grade is based off 3 quizzes and 3 tests. I would recommend you take her  she truly cares about her students passing and understanding the content.
2,I would not recommend Park for people who struggle with math. She speeds through problems assuming everyone is following along. Tests are whatever.. Still failed the class because your grade is solely based on 3quizes 3exams and final. This prof Is great 4 people who are good at math or have taken stats before.
5,Dr. Kim Park is my absolute favorite professor. She's funny  makes the class super interesting  she's very helpful and she makes sure that you'll be able to understand the materials and pass the class. Having her as my professor was such an honor. Lectures are fun  make sure you show up on time and don't miss class you'll do great. no textbook use.
3.5,Lectures are essential to passing. She goes a bit fast but if you do the homework that she assigns (it's optional  but useful) then the tests will go smoothly. Always available to help during office hours. She gives extra credit by adding 10pts to 2 of the tests that the class as a whole did bad on. She doesn't do make ups so don't miss a test day!
4.5,Like a normal college professor  your grade depends solely on quizzes and tests but don't worry  she'll probably curve 2 of them. The book is helpful if you're new to Stats especially if you want an A. But she doesn't collect hw. Calculator is also very helpful since you can just calculate the answers on it for tests and she lets you. Saved me tbh
4,Only three quizzes and three tests. Homework is not collected. She goes over material fast but teaches clearly. Go to class. Gives a lot of extra credit. Take her if you are pre-nursing. One of the better Stats 108 professors. It's hard work  but an A is definitely attainable.
4.5,She's a great professor. Pay attention if you haven't taken stats  but if you did then it's pretty much review. I suggest going to tutoring  and do the homework. It really helps with practice. Go to lectures  they're important. Tests are easy if you know what you're doing. I suggest her as a stats professor. No midterm  cheatsheet for final! Easy.
4.5,She is so funny. Easy class if you show up and pay attention. The homework isn't really necessary. The quizzes and exams are more similar to the format of her in class examples and same quizzes.
2,This class was really challenging for me. She is a good professor but moves really quickly so I recommend going to tutoring if you want to pass the class. Three quizzes  three tests and a cumulative final. Most people would get cs-fs on the exams. She curves the class at the end knowing that most people either drop or will fail.
5,I warn you. You will pass as long as YOU TAKE NOTES!!! Her tests/quizzes are pretty much the examples that she uses on her lectures. I also had her in a LH so be sure to sit up front! Stats is hard overall but she tries her best to organize everything and sometimes curves the tests. She gives homework to do but doesn't collect. CALCULATOR MUST.
5,Applied math major here. def one of the best math profs I've taken at CSULB. I would jump at any opportunity to take her again. Great professor and person.
1,creative leadership seminar. Absolutely aweful. Class was tense and stressfull as she was always yelling at peoplein front of the class  making people cry  and over all being very offensive. She'd take anything the wrong way and start yelling at the class. Didnt learn anything  especially not about creativity or leadership.
1,She needs a new career  some psych help  or both. She bases grades on whether or not she personally likes you. Her classes do really stupid things and have 0 structure. She yelled at me in front of everyone for things like bringing a newspaper to class  wearing heels  and mispronouncing some random word. Don't F up your college career with this one
2,While she seems to have a genuine interest in the success of her students  She doesn't seem to know HOW to help her students. Her expressing concerns felt more like nagging and less about trying to help me in the class. The class is dangerously unstructured and it is often difficult to gauge what she expects from the students.
4.5,Yen Lu is wise and keeps on track. Praise comes at unexpected times. Analysis of subject is very insightfull. She seems a bit sad or at least she is wearing a mask. The core person is a caring  wonderful teacher. Stirs the pot  gets the most out of students who respond and show up.
4,Really nice professor and the class was a blast. Watched a lot of flicks  some were really boring and some were really good  a la To Live (class favorite). Class was fun and the teaching style was different. This class was actually Advance topics in Asian Cinema. Fall '04
4.5,She's really nice and pretty approachable. Her husband passed away during the semester so she took a 1 month leave  so the class slowed down and we really didn't learn anything. However  I felt that I bonded w/ the students in the class  which is what MUSE wants you to do. She's nice& very helpful.
1,Worst teacher I have ever had! Do not take a chance in taking her course. After the last day to add  she is a different person.
3.5,during the course she will pick favorites. She isnot openminded and do not i repeat do not miss any papers  she will dislike you  and if she puts see me on her paper  see her or she will dislike u even more and will give you a bad grade towards the end!
1,the most horrible teacher ever.you never know when she will lose her temper and start screaming at you for any dumb reason.is rarely available for appointments  if she is then she is either late or wants you to get the hell out of her office ASAP.
1,"If she likes you  you've got it made. If not  you're in for it. Don't get too close or she'll make you do something for her. I've never known someone to delegate all of their resposibilities as much as her. She doesn't do anything. Learn how to say """
1,This artist should not be teaching or advising students. She should be doing art.
1,she sucks!!!!! drop her class NOW!!!!!!
1,"Very difficult to follow  inconssistent and unclear. She is not very openminded wich contradicts what she ""represents""."
5,Great teacher... if you just listen and do the work you are almost guaranteed an A.... Very good teacher...
5,Move foward and never look back. You will be making one of the biggest mistakes of you life if you even consider her as a candidate. You will never get a green sheet  she is highly inconsistant and unfair. You will struggle. Dont do it.
1,lacks in teaching codeing..
3,Creative process seminar. Somewhat easy. A few papers. I don't think there was a final.
4.5,He's a great teacher! I had lots of fun in his class  he drops your lowest quiz and test. Only one essay is required. His lectures basically cover everything he'll test you on  i barely looked at the textbook all semester. I would most definitely take a psych class with him again
4,Attendance is mandatory. I missed a couple of his classes which resulted in my missing his pop quizzes. Doesn't let you retake them. Assigns 1 essay. Readings are important. Makes tricky quizzes. He's a nice guy  but I wouldn't take a class from him again.
5,Class was good and if I studied more  would have done better. Very nice teacher who really cares. Kinda hot too with a great personality. Show up each class and you will do well. Yeah the book is boring but thats prob why he lectures like he does. He makes it interesting.
2.5,Nice guy but old school
5,Took this class in Spring of 2013. Usually  I hate night classes and anything with a three hour lecture  but he was good about making the class interesting and ended class if he finished early. Almost everything is gone over in lecture  with just a few book readings to reinforce the topic. There is one paper  but it's no big deal.
5,Great professor. Straightforward class and easy to achieve an A. Complaint: He uses a very dry textbook. As a Psy prof  who no doubt took a course on learning  should know better than almost anyone to use a book that's at least somewhat interesting.
5,if you have the opportunity to take him do it! His class is more than interesting and his tests are made to be passed. Take good notes  read the book and you will get the A. He explains everything prior to tests and final. the pop quiz's are to make sure you are always studying. Great guy and great course.
5,Love this class and teacher is so nice  puts everything into perspective. He is very clear  and very fair! 6 quizzes drops 2  3 tests drops 1  one paper   and a final. Class is 90% lecture based  so showing up is important  but he leaves it up to you. Would take another class with him any day. Favorite teacher at Moorpark so far!
5,Love him! He's so nice and helpful and after having classes all day  he made this 2 hour long class as fun as possible. He was so nice to everyone and really cared about his students and making sure everyone understood. Very easy to get an A without much work. I actually feel like I learned stuff in this class that I'll remember. Take him!
5,He is not only a wonderful professor  but a great man! His class is super fair - and almost easy if you take good notes and attend class. He is very friendly and loves to engage with the class. He will do whatever he can to help  would definitely recommend him. Take good notes - you'll get an A easily.
4.5,Class is very fair  tests are meant to be passed. drops a test and 2 quizzes....take good notes and you will get an A
4.5,Nice teacher with a very positive attitude. His expectations are very clear  grades on a fair point system  simple to understand  makes the class a breeze. I do recommend :)
5,Was always scared to take a 3 hour class  but Joe makes the time fly! He has interesting stories
5,Great class. Very thorough teaching. If you attend class  you will do well. He's not too bad on the eyes as well. His personality is great and he's very helpful. Take him!
5,GREAT TEACHER ! HES TALKS ALOT  BUT IS VERY FUNNY. EXPLAINS THINGS VERY WELL  DOESN'T HAVE A PROBLEM REPEATING HIMSELF OR ANSWERING QUESTIONS.VERY NICE  AND HELPFUL  NOT TO MENTION HIS TESTS ARE SUPER EASY  I NEVER STUDIED  BECAUSE HE ALWAYS REVIEWS THE MATERIAL HES GOING TO TEST YOU ON.. JUST MAKE SURE YOU UNDESTAND IT. HIGHLY RECCOMEND HIM! :)
5,Great teacher. VERY EASY tests and quizzes. Barely even studied. Lectures and notes are clear. Very straightfoward. Pretty funny guy too
5,Although I got a C in the class  I must say he was a remarkable teacher. Nice  helpful  intuitive  and efficient. More professors should be like Murdico.
5,Great teacher. I had him once a week for like 3 hour periods  but he managed to make the class really interesting. Tests were pretty simple  plus he drops your lowest score  along with a few quizzes.
5,I had 2 classes with him. Intro & Abnormal. He's AWESOME. Really friendly  encourages questions  always happy to explain questions (even during tests). He's funny and makes class interesting. He totally made me want to major in psychology. I suggest attending every class because he sometimes has pop quizzes(but super easy.) Take Murdico!
5,Very nice and very understanding. Class is all lecture but I never got bored. He takes the time to explain everything you need to know for the tests. Six quizzes (drops two)  three tests (drops one) and a final. There is a short paper but it is fairly simple. I taking him again next semester  he is great!
4,His class is pretty simple  but if you want to get an A in the class you really have to try. You have to read the assignments assigned because he gives daily online quizes. Visit him during office hours and he'll help you with writing your papers!
4.5,READ READ READ!!!! It's philosophy wether you agree or not its up to you to make the most out of this class in philosophy nothing is considered wrong except you need to EXPLAIN! Great class lots of fun!!!
5,Great teacher. Easy  and wants you to succeed. He makes the course very interesting  and will like you if he sees that you are putting in the effort necessary.
4,He is a very talented and committed teacher. Lots of fun too!
2.5,Paul rocks. I cannot believe that none of the other raters have commented on the hotness factor. If you're reading translations from the ancient Chinese  it makes a big difference. Also very nice elucidation of the implicit tension between Confucianist ritualism and Hegelian dialectics. Thank you Paul.
3,No Comments
5,he illuminated modern philosophy  taught me how to teach myself  makes school fun and challenging for all levels of intelligence and aptitude simultaneously  and soes all of this with a kind of stoner demeanor that makes him all the more approachable. Everyone can and should take from Paul.
5,Not easy  but that's not the point. You learn so much if you put in the effort.
5,He is a great teacher and probably the only good philosophy professor we have. Another surprising thing is that he makes the final paper fun. Anyone at all interested in philosophy should take a course with him.
5,Best professor at WC. Some of these reviews have been written by morons clouded by ideology. That's exactly what PK avoids best  and his calm  collected manner opens your mind to a world of thought beyond what you can prepare for. He's so brilliant that he illuminated Hegel  one of the worst writers of all time  with absolute clarity. Reading is intense  but not overly demanding. Very good about assigning only sections that were essential. Take Paul K  especially 19th Cent Phil  even if your only PH class.
1,UNCLEAR  UNSTRUCTURED  horrible professor. Very intelligent  but unable to express ideas to students.
4.5,No Comments
4,he is one of the most amazing people ever
5,extremely intelligent with valuable insight  understanding  lisitens to students and actually takes their opinions ect.. into accout  very thought provoking  basically the antithesis of switzer
3.5,No Comments
5,Thought provoking  helpful  grading includes incite  shows interest in students  respects reasoned arguments whether or not he agrees. He is not at all radical  this coming from a Republican answering the charges of another rater
2,No Comments
5,Lets you know exactly what will be on the upcoming tests (as long as you stay until the end of class)! Extra credit is easy -- things like go on a hike  or draw and label a cell. She's a great instructor.
5,Dilek Sanver-Wang is one of the dopest teachers in. the. game. Some would argue she is the GOAT in biology. I suck at bio  I'm an english major  but I got B's on the first 2 midterms cuz her lectures are thorough. If you look her up on the COC website there's a pic of her with an owl on her hand  lookin like a straight G. I'll post again at the end
5,Honestly it all depends on the student. I'm not good at biology at all  but reading the book actually helped a lot because I wouldn't grasp anything while I was in lecture. There are 4-5 midterms which are way better  than just the one because it'll be 2-3 chapters at a time rather than chapters 1-10 for only 1 big accumulative midterm. Take her!
5,Professor Dilek is a great professor. She is very caring and always ready to help. She provides study guides and review sessions when possible. He has 4 mid term tests. She does offer extra credit that involves going on a field trip. I would definitely recommend her she is great. You won't regret taking her.
5,The professor explains and lectures on material in a way that can be easily understood. She Is more than fair with questions  grading and extra credit. Gives great handouts for note taking.
5,Awesome teacher. This is not an easy class where you show up and get a grade. You will have to work for it. She offers ec and study guides for the test which are essential. Show up  pay attention  take notes  work hard  complete the work  and study for the exams. Did not need the textbook  her notes and power points were detailed enough.
5,She is such a great teacher! She literally helps you out with anything you don't get and makes it easier to understand. She gives you all the reviews before exams and finals  they can be hard though if you don't study. Very nice and helpful teacher. Would definitely recommend her!
4,I loved this class and this professor. It was a hybrid class  which meant we only came in once a week for labs  and learned the lecture material ourselves. I was pretty worried about the labs and dissections but they were actually pretty easy. The lecture material isn't too hard to grasp if you read the book. Great class she offers extra credit!
5,I thought bio was going to be very boring  but she managed to make it so much fun to the point that i was looking forward to her class & lab. She gives easy hw  she will tell you everything that's on the tests  & will have little reviews. She's willing to stay after class to help out. She's super sweet & her lectures are awesome! would take again!
5,Very nice teacher. Liked her a lot. Would definitely recommend taking the class.
5,Professor was awesome. I took the hybrid class (Lecture online  Monday lab only). The test can be difficult but if you do the homework and the study guides online  you will pass. Make sure to show up and do the extra credit. One of the best teachers I've ever had and one of the easiest going and understanding professors I know. Thanks professor!
5,I have never been able to understand this subject until I took her class. She offers Extra Credit questions on Exams  making it much easier to get a higher score. Very clear and straight forward and is always willing to help if you go to her for it. Overall you could not ask for a better Professor! Highly recommended!
5,Super great teacher and knows what she's talking about and super nice when it comes to asking for help. She is always is there to help when I had questions and was the nicest person to help you understand! I did take the hybrid class and yes the class went super fast and its a lot of work and studying but she goes over the whole test most it helps!
5,She's an amazing professor. As long as you study her notes you'll do fine on the tests
5,Amazing professor! I failed 2 tests (my fault for not studying) and I still passed the class with an A! She gives extra credit and makes biology easy to understand. Definitely would recommend anyone to take her
5,Prof. Dilek was awesome! She teaches botany in a way that is easy to learn  supplementing her lectures with videos and relevant HW assignments. She offers extra credit and puts some into each test too. Just study her study guides and you will be fine. Labs were fun and creative. Would take her for any class she offers!
5,Our class was a 3hour lecture(T)/Lab(TH). At first those lectures were rough but Dilek is really passionate  she makes jokes  shows us videos  & keeps class interesting. Dilek accommodates to her students! I was really struggling but she took the extra time to additionally help me & adjust to my learning style. Dilek is an amazing professor!
5,BEST professor I've ever had Makes the class extremely easy to pass allowed to do extra credit throughout the semester You have to go to class because it is a lab class  obvious. Her lectures are super easy to comprehend and remember  she does review before every exam so its impossible to fail. She posts the textbook outlines on BB
5,She is an amazing professor who goes above and beyond to make sure you understand the material . Take her over any other professor! I ended up with a B but only because i didn't study nor did i take the small quizzes important. The quizzes really add up!
5,I loved her class. I was very engaged throughout the entire semester. The class format is very straight forward and she gives some extra credit. The gives review sessions before each test which are very helpful. I highly recommend her for any class.
3,This professor is in her 1st year and treats her students as 3rd graders  but she helps with your test grades. No need to take notes  because the test info is not from her notes just the book. She will be a good teacher one day.
1,"This professor is extremely difficult. The material is not covered well. All I can say to anyone who takes her is: ""Good luck to you!"""
1,Whatever you do don't take her class. There are no tests to even see if your understanding the material
1,Yes  please never take this professor for Econ unless you want to fail or enjoy challenges. She is sooo hard to understand with that really thick accent  and she makes Econ harder than it is. DO NOT TAKE HER!
1,Horrible teacher  she doesn't answer questions very well and takes forever to reply to e-mails
1,No Comments
2,She is very hard to understand  just take notes and ask her to repeat things if you don't understand. I took her for a summer semester and she flew through the information. However  she did give a really good midterm and final review  study it! Made a B!
1,Very difficult to understand. Teaches as if we should all be experts in Economics. Mid-Term and Final exam awful.
1,This professor should NOT be teaching at a community college. She is EXTREMELY rude and favors past students! You only have a midterm and a final which are so complex that it would take a rocketscientist to figure them out! Whatever you do DONT take her!
1,Nor easy to understand. writting on the board ilegible.Won't answer questions if she thinks you should know.Treats students as subordinates. first quiz equivelent to a final exam before it is taught. She thinks teaching is telling you something.no method
1,hard as a diamond. i hope atleast someone passes her final exam.
1,She is not helpful at all. She is not easy to understand either.
1,Bad teacher  Midterm is after the drop date. Hard to understand. She is always 10-15 minutes late to class and then takes smoke breaks right in the middle of her lecture. Hard to follow. Funny lady  just not good at explaining economics.
4,great prof who took the time to speak to students. available in office or by phone or email
5,Dr. Hirsch your so cool! I loved your class. It was easy to understand and the tests were not only mind boggling  they were fun because they were sooo hard. I LOVE YOU for making me learn.
1,"teacher from hell. everyday in her class is like torture to your brain. this teacher gives so much work you'll end up going nuts. cmon not all of us are geniuses and scientists. were just taking anatomy as a prereq. if ur a nerd take this class ut if ur an average ""B"" student. avoid her."
2.5,Tuff teacher but b/c she wants u to learn  if ur lazy and are not willing to study and learn the material do not take this class b/c it is hard so  do not blame teacher for ur lazyness.
1,Very hard professor to get an A. She'll make work hard to pass her class.... 45 students at the beginning of the semester  downt to 12 sudents.. if you care about your grade dont take her class..
1,This Professor is the worst experience of my life!!! She sucks! For any of you majoring in science do not take her class  its a wate of time. She does not care and is not willing to help. To top it off she is not a morning person. So beware.. She will confuse the brains out of you and make your life a living hell in the process!
1,"the first thing is that she talk 2 fast in lecture  trying 2 rush  no help  must write almost endless cycle of lab report  do not say anything and expect u 2 no. u can try to kiss her butt but i wouldnt. when u look confused during lecture  dont ask  she gonna say""what does it look like to u""  if i had known better  i would drop the class 1st week."
2,we're suppose to learn and not to be more confused. this teacher blows.
4,Dr. Hirsch is a nice professor. Despite hideous remarks students have made  they have not taken time to communicate with her. Thus  they R lost in the material & topics. You REALLY have 2 WORK HARD in her class 2 succeed especially when most students R planning 2 apply 2 professional school. CV & Personal Statement R required for a reason!!
3,Dr. Hirsch is a busy professor. She gives LOTS of homework but READ & STUDY! Its possible 2 get an A in her class. Do ALL the hmwk & keep track of ALL your grades. Do NOT miss class. She comes off as mean or snippy  but she's a nice lady. If u want an A in her class  WORK FOR IT! Pay attn 2 study guides  read all chapters & extra credit oppty.
1,This teacher seems easy at first but you should take it from all the students that she's had before....Run the other way when you hear or see her name for a class. She will leave you confused and wanting to fall asleep in the first 15 min of class  THIS TEACHER doesn't even run the experiments right  and her supplementary hour is just crap!!!!!!!
1,if you want to save stress in your life do not take dr. hirsch shes the worst teacher ive ever had  she should retired already  shes a pain in the ass who doesnt care about her students just her check  she gives ou too much hw  and her test are just pathetic  so hard and you will have 10test and 5practicums her semester  no kidding. avoid stress...
1,she is the worst teacher in ELAC that i ever had. She is not clear at all. You will never know what is she doing. DO NOT take her with any class
1.5,Not a good teacher. She gives out a lot of reading assignments and they take at least 3 hours to do and at the end they are only worth 5 pts and she is always deducting pts for stupid reasons. She was also absent a lot and her CV's and personal statements are a waste of time. She is not a patient person and she is just not worth the time of day.
1,this is a bad teacher she is so bitter and cranky you can't even ask her a question w/out her getting mad dose not try to explain anything and is absent during the fall semester alot she needs to retire and not make this subject such a nightmare for students Anatomy is very interesting and is the core for nursing students look4anotherschool or tech
3,She's not a good teacher for the subject. The material is hard enough and strenous as it is  now add monotony to the lectures and outdated handounts. I know it's a hard subject  but if she wasn't so unbearably boring  maybe more people could stay and pass her class.
3.5,Dr. Hirsch is a busy professor. She gives LOTS of homework but READ & STUDY! Its possible 2 get an A in her class. Do ALL the hmwk & keep track of ALL your grades. Do NOT miss class. She comes off as mean or snippy  but she's a nice lady. If u want an A in her class  WORK FOR IT! Pay attn 2 study guides  read all chapters & extra credit oppty.
1,NEVER TAKE HER CLASS!!! That is too much work  not much explanation/teaching. She absents a lot. You will not learn much.People skips her class a lot. The class start as 36+ people  now there are only around 15 left... It is a waste of time! Trust me.
1,The materials is hard no matter what  but the way she teaches and the material she gave out during class is horrible. Not much help during lab. Avoid....
1,This was the worst teacher i ever had  people would sleep during her lecture. I recommend to not take this teacher cause a lot of people would fail.
4,Go ahead and ignore any review that's before 2016 as he's changed his style. 1st 2 tests don't matter grade wise. STUDY THE POWERPOINTS  supplement with the book if needed  do the hw  GO TO CLASS  ask questions so he knows who you are  and the A is yours. If you UNDERSTAND THE PATHWAYS  then the final is easy. His tests were easier than Renthal's.
5,Dr. Chambers is an awesome professor. Dr. Chambers just made it easier to learn biochem but you still have to study alot. anyone who complains about him was just being lazy and wanted an easy A. I just took a practice MCAT and scored 515 with no studying or practice because he makes you learn and understand not just memorize.
1,Horrible class
5,Dr. Chambers is very knowledgeable  passionate  and funny. I took this course in fall because the other easy professors were taken  and I am glad I did. I been studing for the MCAT and this class made the bio-chemical section a breeze! It was hard  for sure  but worth it. Make sure you show up to every class.
3,Content is well-explained
1,Exams were extremely difficult (10 questions free response no curve) I would not recommend this professor very fast course.
4,Tough class but as long as you go to class and do all the homework questions you should be fine. He was the most available professor to offer help with any questions I had at UTSA. Study sessions every Sunday afternoon and every day after class.
4.5,I learned a lot in this class. Honestly  if you're a pre-med  you need this class. He teaches on the med school level. He is hard  but if you put in work you WILL make an A. He had sunday sessions and after class coffee sessions. No professor puts in this much effort to help his students. Go to everything  make you get to know him  and you'll live.
2.5,This was one of the most confusing classes. His handwriting is impossible to read and his lectures were all over the place. Basically memorize all the amino acid structures and know all of the pathways and cycles backward and forward.
2,AVOID at all costs  this guys grading system is the most messed up thing Ive ever seen  the first two tests are nothing compared to the final  during class he went to Europe for some reason and gave us lectures to learn on our own. Whenever you try to ask a question in class he ignores you unless you yell at him.
3,Grade is made up of quizzes  midterm  and final(comprehensive). Quizzes usually 5 questions  and you only have 30 seconds to answer before he moves on. I read and understood all chapters and sections  and worked problems at the end of the book. I've never failed a class. If you're not doing well  don't place false hope in the final. I failed bad.
3.5,Dr. Chambers is a good professor but you have to work really hard in his class. You must go to class to understand the topics he wants you to know... Then take his information and spend a lot of time researching and learning it yourself. The final is extremely difficult but if you kept up during the class and studied really hard - you can do well
4,Well I wouldn't make Chambers sound as easy as the previous person but doing good in his class is completely possible. Made an A on both tests and final. I read all the chapters&did the probs at the end of the chapters. Going to class is a MUST. I never missed a single class and had great notes to constantly review. That's it.
5,Honestly he's a great professor. He's not bad at all. All you have to do is show up to his class and listen. What he teaches in class is whats gonna be on the test. study his notes and read the sections he assigns in the book! i got an 84 on the first test and a 96 on the second. havent taken the final yet. To get an A just understand the material
5,Be ready to work  but not impossible. Class is mandatory if you want to do good! He skips around and picks and chooses stuff in the later chapters  and if your not there  you will be studying the entire book. I got an A on the first test  B on the second. If you get an A on the final  thats what you get for the class
3.5,I would make Dr. Chambers a REQUIRED professor to take if you plan on going to medical school. His approach will teach you what to expect when you get there. Dr. Chambers is very demanding but can teach you a lot if you put in the work. I'm an A student (that made a C in his class) but I received a lot of knowledge and suggest him often.
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS PROF!!! I am an A student and made a C in his class! u dont know what ur grade is in the class the entire time. u can make A's on both his midterms and make a C he pullS the grades out of his bum. DO NOT TAKE!!
2,"he teaches the framework but tests over everything. this class required more out of class time than any other class i have had (~80 hours so far)and yielded a C :/ would not recommend. i asked where conference hours were held and got yelled at ""in on the syllabus"". it wasn't  and he didn't apologize. just called me irresponsible. 0/5"
1,Don't trust him. He said kept saying not to worry about the first two tests cause if you get an A on the final then you get an A in class. Only problem  where did that final come from. Study everything and for every test.
2.5,Well. They dont call him chainsaw chambers for nothing. Not very clear on what he wants you to study. He emphasizes NOT using the book  and ONLY listening to him  but  his notes can be kind of confusing. Got a 10 on the first test! a 30 on the 2nd test  and a 70-something on final. Walked away with a C! Class averages were similar to those grades.
3.5,In terms of research  he is very cutthroat. He will do anything for grant money to beat out his competitors  even if it means playing unfairly. It's not personal
5,Very nice guy  pretty funny as well. Great to talk to about grad schools and the like if that's what you need. Yes he makes you memorize the amino acids  but get over it. The class is interesting  and I'd still say it's more conceptually based than memorization based. Especially compared to evil bios 302. Tests are challenging  but it was nice to actually be challenged on a test and get a chance to show what I learned.
3,He's a nice guy and pretty good at lecturing. Tests are too hard for the material he presents. Visit him in the office  don't take his class.
4,Incredibly hard material and too much memorization for my comfort  but that's not the professor's fault.
3.5,Good guy. I got screwed on the curve  and he wouldn't help me out  but I still think he is a good guy and a good teacher. I'm sure if you went to him for help  he'd be helpful  I just wouldn't know for sure.
4.5,Great professor who forces certain things to be memorized  all of which are actually useful. He also tests over the material in a clear and straightforward manner. His review sessions are not a waste of time-he actually cares that you learn the material.
4.5,She was an absolutely amazing professor. I really loved her. She just had so much positive energy and such a great attitude. She made me appreciate Theatre. If you have any chance to have her  do it! You won't regret it. Very easy and fun too  I miss her as a professor.
5,everyone has to fulfill their fine arts requirement so take this class for an easy A. once a week class  really boring but halrious because the teacher is a joke. you ca hand every assignment except for one   a week late without points off.
4,No need to buy the book. Tests and quizzes are mostly matching and she gives you extra credit for drawing pictures on the sides of your exams. She automatically gave all of us A's on our first essay assignment as long as we handed it in-even the people who handed it in after the one week grace period  which applies to all of her assignments.
1,"Very easy take this class. allows ""one week grace period"" for all assignments except the play review. lets you out a few minutes early for every class. take this class to fill your fine arts requirement. this class is a joke.."
1.5,"very easy teacher. gives you a one week ""grace"" period for all assignments except this one play review. quizzes are matching. take this class to fill your fine arts requirement! rarely use the book."
5,Professor McAfee was a very kind woman who reminded me of my kindergarten teacher. She made the assignments easy and clear. I'd recommend her again for sure.
5,It was an absolute joy...which is certainly helpful when the class is on Saturday morning at 11am. We used the book a few times  but we mostly watched videos and made fun of theater. Midterm prod. project was fun. You will have to see 3 plays...2 school prods and a prof. production. Lots of fun  though!
5,It was an absolute joy...which is certainly helpful when the class is on Saturday morning at 11am. We used the book a few times  but we mostly watched videos and talked about lovemaking and lust. Midterm prod. project was fun. You will have to see 3 plays...2 school prods and a prof. production. Lots of fun  though!
5,BEST teacher at Southern  hands down. Prof. McAfee is very excited to teach other students what she knows about Theater! You DO NOT need the book  don't listen to other reviews. I didn't open it once. Study 1-2 hours for each test and the tests will be absolute CAKE. The terms on the test are extremely easy to memorize!! G.P.A BOOOOOOOSTTT
5,What a great professor Joan is. Vibrant personality  humorous  and makes you feel very comfortable. Relaxing class  and all material is split up perfectly for lecture. McAfee is not a pushover. You need the book. The grade you get in this class is EXACTLY what you put into it. I am going to miss this class  it was my favorite one this semester.
5,SUCH A KIND HEARTED WOMAN  CARES ABOUT STUDENTS  VERY EASY
5,If you dont take this class with her  you are missing out on so much! Class participation is a must  so be prepared to do whatever wacky thing she tells you. Do ALL the assignments. She's not a push over  but she's not mean either. She's tough  but so sweet at the same time. Take this class WITH McAfee!!! You will not regret it.
5,amazinggg teacher. made class so much fun and it was worth going to so early in the morning.
5,she is great! she has the best personality and is always busting out into characters. i learned so much more than i thought i would from this class.
5,My favorite class last semester. I wasn't even sure I was going to like theatre but she deffinately changed my mind. As long as you go to class you should be golden  and ofcourse watch the plays that she assigns and you should be set (there's like 2). She really is an amazing teacher  take her!
5,I loved this class!
5,I adore Ms. McAfee. I can't imagine anyone not loving her class. It's pretty easy as long as you show up and pay attention.
5,Very nice and extra helpful. Did fun stuff like improv and lots of movies. Best professor Ive had.
4.5,Theatre 375  and Joanie  is amazing. Since it is a class where we perform a play to an audience  she can get strict at times but only because it's a production so class is mandatory  like play rehearsal. She is so much fun and makes theatre fun. If you've never acted  this class is perfect for you. Joanie is vibrant and loving and extremely cool.
5,AWSOME professor. So much fun and HILLARIOUS personality.
1,Took this professor's auditing class. This was the only class in the entire program I c received a grade below B- because he didn't teach anything and tested you on everything. I personally complained to the dean multiple times and was told he was tenured and nothing could be done to him. Waste of tuition! Seek another professor if you can.
1,Please  do yourself a favor and do not take this class. Over half the class has complained to the university  they do nothing because the man is on tenure. By far the worst professor in CT  perhaps the US. I am passing along with a few others only because we've taken acc classes before. He spends 90% of class telling stories. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!
2.5,"The whole semester I was struggling  basically teaching myself with the book. He calls the book ""dumb"" but uses it for everything. If you go to every class and take good notes  he will look at the end of semester and note your good note taking  I was surprised to get a B  thought I failed..."
1,Please save yourself!!
1.5,He is a smart guy there is no doubt about that. But sometimes you have to just call it a day and realize it is tome to move on. The take home exams aren't bad but he relies way too much on the text and doesn't explain concepts well. And be ready to hear some stories.
2,Come on guys. Give him a break. He is definitely hard  and if you have questions about the material then you are in the wrong class. Go to all his classes  copy his formats that he puts on the board  and do all the homework. You'll be fine. All his exams are take home exams. Take the class for his stories alone. Hes really not all that bad.
1,"WoW! I recomend everyone take a class with him  for the experiance alone. Its amazing that they let this guy teach at a university. SCSU is a joke for keeping this guy. I asked a question in class and he reponded ""did you read the book 10 times"""
1,this class was unbarable! i cannot discribe in words how horrible of a person this man is. he is by far the worst teacher in the world  i did not learn one thing  and if you ask him questions in class he tells you that your dumb and a baby  i lost my mind in this class  litteraly verge of tears entering his class room. PLEASE save your selve
1,extremely bad teacher. Doesn't know how to teach and makes fun of you in front of the whole class. Doesnt speak english very well either. Spends more than half the period talking about his life and yells at u if u waste class time on talking to a class mate for help. DO NOT TAKE HIM VERY BADDDDDD
1,Congrats! officially the worst Prof. at SCSU. If at all possible avoid his classes. The worst class ever.
1,Worst Prof. ever!!! Talked about snow tires and his children for 2 hours twice a week. I would not recommend taking any of his classes.
1,OMG Avoid him he is horrible you can't understand him  everything he teaches you is pointless and doesn't help one bit for the entire course. He gives these crazy long exams and their so hard because he doesn't teach anything. If your an accouting major at Southern you should do something else because he teaches alot of the courses its horrible
1,VERY hard to understand. you teach yourself basically. the first day of class he picks on students. he rambles for 2 hours about NOTHING. however  if you survive the semster  he becomes bearable and if you ask for an extention he might allow it. other wise  try to avoid!
2,WORST TEACHER I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!! If you want to learn anything about accounting DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! During class he rambles on about pointless stories and tries to cram in the material the last 10 mins of class and expects u to stay after the class is over. You basically have to teach yourself the material. HE IS USELESS!!
1,He is extremely bad teacher. I thinks that he knows everything and we (the students) are ignorant. I would not recommend this teacher evne if he was the last one that i need for graduate with my bachelor degree.
1,he is the worse professor i have ever had. he does not explain the material clearly  in fact he will confuse you instead of making the subject easier. seriously DONOT take this professor he will make your life misrable.
1,Very difficult to understand. Very unhelpful.
1.5,Currently enrolled in his class  which I already took at another college. Do NOT take him-- he is a complete waste of time  assumes you already know the material and is just giving you a refresher. You will have to read  study and learn on your own!! Be prepared to spend many hours re-reading chapters and figuring out the material on your own.
1,Now hes teaching the next accounting level that i need and i dont know if i should take it because i didnt learn anything in the 220 class
1,I hate this class. Im an accounting major and I havent learned anything from this class when i walk out of class i dont even remember what was talked about in class. The only good thing about this professor was his stories but other than that i dont like him as a teacher.
4.5,The class was almost entirely based on class discussion. We did outside work but it was rarely discussed in class. Looking back  my Spanish conversation and listening skills improved  but my writing skills stayed pretty much constant. Good teacher and not too demanding.
5,No Comments
4.5,No Comments
4.5,Raquel ****tan makes learning Spanish very fun. Be warned that you will have to learn the grammar on your own  as she spends each class basically talking with the class in Spanish.
4.5,Professor Mackie is a wonderful professor and incredibly intelligent and helpful.
5,Dr. Mackie is very helpful  and she has a great understanding of Ancient Greek. She also makes sure that all questions  no matter how hair-splitting  are resolved. This can become tedious but is very necessary in a language like Greek.
5,If you can understand conceptual math by reading  then I suggest this course. Otherwise  you should take a lecture course. As long as you read and do the assignments  you can pass. They provide hints and explain how to solve several of the problems. However  if you're an accounting major  this probably won't help you memorize well.
5,Easy A. Took a 5 week summer course. There's about 300 problems due every week through the learnsmart program in a system called connect  plus 8 homework questions. At first I didn't understand why everyone said this class is easy. Then I realized if you use all your resources  you'll find that the answers are right in front of your face.
5,Solid choice for Accounting 1  wonderful professor! Highly recommend!
5,Whoah  I just finished a 5 unit class in under 5 weeks! Give yourself enough time to finish all the assignments. Score high on those as well as the tests. I had some interaction with the professor  but really this is a class that you can do on your own. Took this class with Connect and had to buy an online code  that's the only downside.
3,"I took the class online Fall 2016. I used to study from Chapter Interactive mostly  sometimes from the huge book or power points. I took notes when watching each chapter interactive. There is some extra credit ""LearnSmart"" of 2 points for each chapter. Also  10 extra points for taking LACCD survey. 1 weekly homework  and 1 bimonthly exams."
5,Loved taking this class online with this professor! Easy but you have to read to understand the basic concepts.
5,This review is for an Online summer class. You have to put the time into reading and understating the content. It is not a difficult class but you must put an effort into it. I highly recommend his online class. Account is like learning a different language it takes putting into practice what you learn to ensure that you understand it.
5,Took him for Accounting 1 and got a B. It was a breeze despite having another class during that period. You just have to contain yourself and you can end up with an A or a B.
4,TOOK THE 6 WEEK WINTER CLASS AND IT WAS FAIRLY EASY. HE'S VERY AVAILABLE TO HELP WITH QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS. GREAT CLASS.
4,I took his 5 week accounting 1 class and got an A . Homework assignments are as clear as ever . He uses connect from McGraw hill for the entire class . The homework assignments have video examples that teach you how to solve the problems. Use all ur connect resources and you will pass . Make sure to do extra credit   it really matters.
3.5,Professor Ludwig gives extra credit so if you mess up on test the few extra points will help you and that was very much appreciated. He also responds to your emails in a timely fashion. I took course online and was a little confused but once I got the hang of it I was good. You can repeat assignments for better grade and that's just fantastic!
5,I took this class online and really enjoyed it. Assignments are laid out from the beginning so you know exactly what you are expected to do and by when. You also are given the opportunity to work ahead to complete assignments before they are due. If you read the material the work is easy as well as the tests. I definitely recommend this course!
3,I took this class online over the winter session. After reading his reviews  I figured the course would be a walk in the park however I was extremely misinformed. The tests are extremely difficulttricky and the work load is intense. Do not expect this class to be a breeze! Passed but not sure I would take again  it was pretty frustrating.
3.5,This class was easy. There really is no interaction with the professor so it's all up to you. Online resources are helpful. If you need to take this class because it's a requirement take it because it's easy but If you want to learn and use it later take another teacher. He is not the most friendly so don't expect much.
4,This was a 16 week class that I was able to complete in less than two weeks. All of the homework assignments  exams  and extra credit problems are out of the textbook so getting an A should not be a problem. Since the class was online  there was little interaction with the instructor aside from the occasional chat session  email  or announcement.
4,This was a five-week class that I completed in three weeks with barely an effort. Exam questions are out of the textbook and the homework assignments give you instant feedback as to whether your answers are right or wrong. The instructor responded to questions through chat and was very generous with the extra credit that was available as an option.
5,2nd time taking him  easy A and if you want to learn then you will. take him  tons of extra credit and not a whole lot of work.
5,Gerald Ludwig is my favorite accounting professor. He is very nice and very fair with grades  and he makes tests not too difficult. He assigns extra credit and homework assignments that are hard not to get 10/10 on. I prefer his online class since it's a bit easier for me but he is an excellent teacher in-person as well. Take him for accounting!!
5,"Took Ludwig's accounting one class online  and was very easy and learned a ton. has about 11 percent total extra credit in class and the homework has unlimited tries  so impossible not to get a 100 on that and about 6 exams that are all multiple choice  40 questions each  on two ch's each. taking again for accounting 2. got an ""A."""
4,if you read you will pass then tests are a piece of cake and if you need help he's is always open to your questions he has ALOT of patience ! great professor!

4.5,Dean Frank is one of the nicest people I have ever met in my life. She takes her students very seriously and will take the time to listen. She will do anything to help her students. She is very sweet and knows how to make anyone feel better. She is one of the best faculty members at Kennesaw State.
5,very knowledgable about topics

2,Patronizing.
1.5,Horrible. Talks down to you  too.

4,Just stand up to him guys!!! The reasons why he makes us do everything very thoroughly is because when you get into the real world that's how its gotta be!!!!! You'll thank him later!
3.5,He helps out when you ask for it. In the first semester you just need to stand up to him when he criticizes you and he'll respect you. Make sure to put units on everything.
4,great teacher...just different teaching tactics
5,He can be a bit intimidating  but I find once you take the time and show him that you are actually making his time worth the effort  he will treat you fine. He doesn't want to waste his time with students who don't do anything in the class. Chem isn't easy  he knows it and proves it everyday.
3.5,Really knows his stuff. Seems like he's just putting in time though.
1,Its because of him i dropped out.. and i have become pencilphobic.
2.5,Do not let this man get to you. He loves taking students down. I did not do well in his labs but now I am a chemistry teacher. I aim to be the opposite of Mr. Ford and have students actually like chemistry rather than run from it!
1,dropped Chem cause of him.
3,Just be a smartass right back to him and you'll get along fine.
1,I quit school because of him.
2.5,Seriously who does this guy think he is. Doesnt Have his PhD. but still thinks hes god. If you want to get through the class  tell him off the first lab  or he will lip you all year  stand up to him and you will be good to go.
4,No Comments
2,Sure he knows his stuff but comments need to be addressed a certain way. We are adults.
3.5,VERY tough lab... but if you check the lab answers before you hand in your lab  you'll get though it. Tests are brutal. Labs are well written. Make sure you listen to EVERY LITTLE COMMENT he makes  or he'll make you feel like an idiot.

1.5,Adolf Ford is a strick lab instructor.
5,Incredible woman with such a large heart and lots of stories. I loved talking to her and miss presence here a lot. She really helps you understand the texts with all of her background information and makes lectures interesting. Hopefully she'll be back in Spring 06.
5,Teaches German Noble Laureate  European Filmmaker  and Modern German Literature classes. She is an amazing professor who helps contextualize each work  making every class period extremely engaging. She doesn't give bad grades.
3,I took the online course  and it wasn't that bad. I suppose if you don't have to see her in person she's better to talk to. However she did freak out on us when one person posted a message in the wrong topic. Other than that she was chill.
1,Everyone has pretty much said it all  but here it is again. She is very unclear  runs about four weeks behind in her grading throughout the whole semester. So it is hard to tell how you are doing. She gets mad very easy and does not have a sense of humor at all. terrible teacher... do not take her class...
1.5,I was very intrested in the class but because of very poor communication became fastly frustrated. Online classes need to have a strong backbone for the support of the students - which she doesnt have.
1,i took this class online. she never told you how you are doing or if you were doing anything correctly. she is very unorganized and always has an excuse for everything. don't take her class.
1,DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER  unclear  test ?'s are Awkward She puts half the class to sleep with her lectures.She makes Hist. even more boaring. she is unorganized. she will lose your work and blame you. doesn't know what fun is.
3,Took online class. Wasn't that difficult. I think she's a better teacher if you don't have to see her.
2.5,This teacher is very difficult. She confused me with the assignments. I like history a lot and she made me dislike it a lot in her class.

1,DOn't take from her.
2.5,Hmmm...seems nice outside of class. I agree with the controlling comment. And very suspicious of students.
2,Controlling woman who is in dire need of some fun.
4.5,Homework tutorial sessions are VERY helpful  as are his office hours. His voice can be kind of monotonous  but he really knows what he's talking about.
4,He's a pretty cool teacher. Sometimes the math is confusing  especially if it isn't something you've covered in-depth before. However  he's extremely nice and helpful. Help sessions are a definite must for homework though.
3.5,Hannon is a nice guy  HW help sessions are a MUST attend if u want to do decently. Class is just HS physics using calculus  so u dont really learn much. Class is boring  just him proving eqtns on chalkboard. Labs are hell  wouldnt take class unless u really like physics. yuck
5,I don't know what all these people were saying about too much math  it's just simple calculus based physics. In fact if you took AP Physics in highschool  and payed attention  this class should be mostly review.
4,No Comments
4.5,Very helpful and nice  especially at HW help sessions and office hours. If you're into physics and you have a solid background  definately take it from him and not in the big lecture class. It is hard material - but he makes it interesting.
5,The other reviewers are mistaken. We only solved one kind of ODE: u'' + a u = b. Basic results from ODEs and Vector Calc (dot-products and integrals) are used to study physics.
4.5,Hannon is a great guy. He really cares about his students. The class  however  is a wreck. I took baby physics in HS and thought I could handle it. WRONG. This class covers all sorts of math it shouldn't - like vector and diffe. yikes.
1.5,This prof basically teaches a differential equations class  with applications that happen to nominally relate to physics. If you haven't taken Diff eqns  get ready for a ride. Great once you get past the math barrier-but not well presented.
3,"Professor Reed is a great professor  but if you are a conservative  he may offend you in many ways. He speaks greatly about ""Bernieites"" but as soon as he brings up President Trump  it's nothing but garbage. Besides his harsh opinion in lecture  the material he gives you helps you with the exams. SI sessions are a must if you want a good grade."
5,If you enjoy history Professor Reed is probably the best you can get. I found his lectures on point and enjoyable and he clearly has a vast knowledge of American history. He provides many real world and personal examples that are useful and make the class more enjoyable. He finds modern day things to compare history to to help you understand.
4,Class was an easy A for me. I went 3 times (test days) and got an A. Tests are written essays and I always crammed 3 days before (It worked for me). Here's how you get an A... GO TO SI AND TA SESSIONS  email TA's about outline and thesis  study with flashcards  write 10-15 pages for essay (It sounds scary but it's easy to do)  10/10 would recommend
5,John is an amazing lecturer  his tangents are hilarious and usually relate back to the point. This class was actually super interesting
2,Not going to lie. How I passed this class is literally going to class a week before a midterm to get the questions and then  I googled the stuff before class on my drive to the university. When I did attend class  the lectures were long and never on topic. The TAs were no help either as they were too busy with their own studies to help.
4,He's a smart and funny guy. He goes off topic here and there  but he covers all the information he needs. You will actually learn in his class. If you like history you'll like him. The class is pretty much just lecture with 3 midterms. It's not the easiest class that you'll ever take  but it's also a class made for freshmen.
1,Professor Reed is a good guy  but his lectures tend to drag on and he goes off topic a lot. The grading system for this course was WACK. Your grade is made up of 3 midterms and if you mess one up  you may as well drop the course. Definitely go to the TA sessions before the midterms!
1,Didn't even understand what his lectures were about. Couldn't follow them. It didn't sink in
1,Mr. Reed is not very good at teaching. His lectures drag on and on to the point where it made me decide to just not go to class. He loves to go off topic during lectures too. Your grade is based on 3 essay exams  one that is 200 points  then the other two are 400. Advice? Go to the TA and SI study sessions. You learn more there and get to the point
1,the only thing for your grade is 3 in class essays. and the lectures sometimes dont nessisarily relate to the midterms. however you can get all of the information by either reading the book  or going to the TA/SI led sessions
2,While he may know what he is talking about  he talks for so long and brings in so many random references to the lectures (such as star trek or his daughter) that the important parts become unclear. There are only 3 exams for the semester and these are your only grades  so be sure to attend the SI and TA sessions before each exam.
1,Don't take this class whatever you do. Professor reed is very intelligent  but he rambles about the most random things. He brings up glocks and tommy lee jones at LEAST once every lecture. You only have three or four grades  which are all in class essays. The TA & SI sessions are where you learn and get to the point. Take Econ instead.
4,You have 3 exams  two worth 400 points and one worth 200 points  and this is the only thing on your grade. The exams are easy to pass as long as you go to the study sessions by the TA's! I've only been to this class on exam days  most of the information you need is given to you during the study sessions. Just study and you'll do fine.
2,Professor Reed  and his lectures  are very monotone  dry and boring. I only went to class twice outside of the tests (which are essays) and still received an A. Going to class and buying the book are not necessary at all. But going to the TA sessions the days before the tests are CRUCIAL to passing. They go over exactly what you should write.
5,Professor Reed is a really cool dude. He really isn't as intimidating as you think. The class is based off of 3 tests that are essays. That may seem hard but it really isn't that bad (especially if you attend the TA sessions). I was an hour and a half late to our final and Reed let me take it with the full time in the testing center BLESSED.
2.5,He is not clear and his lectures make class go on forever! He puts his lectures online  so you don't have to go to class  but class helped a lot. I didn't really learn anyhting from him  it was mostly just the TAs.
5,Professor Reed has clear  well constructed lectures that specifically prepare you for the exams. This is NOT a memorize and pass class. You need to be able to digest the information and explain diverse factors to support a thesis statement for the exams. The assigned reading is essential. TAKE notes  his lectures are very helpful.
4,I really liked this teacher  and his lectures were really interesting. The tests are easy if you take notes . You don't really need the book if you take good notes in class  and if you need help the TA's are the ones you need to talk to. He gave us the question beforehand so we could write an outline for the exams.
2.5,His lectures are long  the way he talks makes you want to sleep and the tests are not a good time. Three blue book essays  that's it. Not very understanding  old geezer type who doesn't care about your grades. Class not overly challenging but would not recommend taking it from him.
3,The tests on his class is in class had writing a paper about one question that he randomly choose from two questions he gave us earlier. I just can't understand why would anybody test student like that. Why don't him just let us write the paper and turn in like a regular professor.
5,This was my first history class in years  but Professor Borgwardt made it really accessible. She was available readily outside of class to answer questions and her lectures were engaging and helpful. She expects a lot from you in terms of readings  but she's very clear about her expectations and helps you meet them.
4,Professor Borgwardt is a very good professor who gives engaged  meaningful  and insightful lectures. Personally  I can find her to be a bit verbose and can spend too much time explaining the philosophical concept behind an assignment. However  the quality of her lectures and openness during office hours more than makes up for this.
5,Professor Borgwardt is one of those professors that gives hope to the world of academia by ensuring future academics are mentored well. Her lectures and discussions are fascinating and she is attentive to students' and their interests outside of class. Her office hours are frequent. Her insight is incredibly valuable  and she is genuinely kind.
5,Excellent professor.
5,Best professor I've had at WashU
5,The best professor I have ever had! Recommend that anybody take a class with her if possible!!!
5,Best professor I have ever had.

1.5,"As an ""A"" student  this class ranks as the most difficult class I have ever taken due to this professor.He wants to fail you.Tests are multiple choice but very tricky.Students were lucky because he injured his foot so Dr. Sanchez took over. Sanchez was the exact opposite of Vandergrift.Class is still hard but Sanchez wants you to pass.Take Sanchez!"
3.5,He has a terrible attitude to students  especially to those who come late to class. His tests are very tricky  but he appears to be knowledgeable  he requires a lot  and those who are willing to learn will be thankful they took his class.
1,"I would highly advise not taking this professor. He is rude to students. He will go out of his way and disrupt class to call a student out on being late. He thinks students should know most material already. The way he pronounces words such as ""tissue"" are ridiculous!! He is not there for the student. Students are afraid to ask a question."
1,are you joking never ever have i had a professor who i hated going to class with. the way he explains things are ridicules you dont even want to ask a question because he will make you look bad. DONT TAKE HIM!!!!!!!!!
3,Very knowlegeable professor. You can tell he loves teaching anatomy. Don't be late to class or he will make fun of you. His tests are straight forward. Make sure to study the study guides he gives for each exam. You will get an idea of how he words his tests.
3,Vandergrift....what an interesting fellow... He is hard  but lets face it  it's a complicated subject. It's often difficult to tell the difference between him being serious and joking. DONT BE LATE unless you want the entire class to know your business. If he tells you things won't be on the exam  dont believe him! Cramming is NOT an option
5,Great professor! some students say he's everywhere in his lecture but the truth is  he is very precise and he tells you exactly what he wants you to know. The class is difficult but he makes it light by injecting jokes here and there. If ur serious about learning anatomy  take him coz he knows what he's talking about.
3,I think Bob Vandergrift is good guy. His lectures went off track quite a bit. He is unclear at times  and is extremely mean if you are late to class even on minute  you might as well not even come if your 1 min late. He enjoys what he teaches but I recommend going to another instructor..
3,You have no choice coz he teaches all sections and its a basic requirement to enter the nursing program. Pay attention to his lectures coz what he says will be on the test. It is a little difficult though to filter the important information from the lousy jokes he injects in his lectures. He has a tendency to embarass you infront of the class...
3.5,Took him for only lecture. He is intimidating but that is just how he is. He is a smart ass too. Seems like he is not approachable but he is. If youre willing to learn  hes willing to teach. When he says certain things are not going to be on the test STUDY THEM DONxc3x82xe2x80x99T BELIEVE HIM I found out the hard way but got a B.
3.5,GREATTTT teacher!! very hard but great and very nice! if your serious about your class then you will pass if your not serious he will fail you... hes a great bio teacher!!
4,I think Mr. Vandergrift is a great teacher. You absolutely must be on time and pay attention and that is really all he is picky about. It is a hard subject but he tries to make it fun. The tests are hard but fair and I would take him again if given the chance. If you really care to learn he is the man to take  he knows his subject well.
3.5,He is intimdating. His whole point is to get people who are not serious about the class out of it. He will have pop quizzes when students start leaving during half time  so I encourage you to stay. He gives a study guide for all his test  and allows notecards for test eventually  which help greatly! DO the study giudes and you will do fine.
5,He seems intimidating  but throughout the sememster you will learn a lot of things..this man knows what he's doing and trust me  read the book before each class you will know what he is talking about in lecture and can make things fun for u...for a subject like anatomy...you will be fascinated because he is fascinated about anatomy  study for an A.
3,"You ""will"" pass the class if you really want to. For the ones who are not serious & miss class alot  you will fail. Trust me. Take Sato for lab. You'll be glad you did. Vandergrift's lectures are confusing & seem to not make sense. Just read the book & study guides given & you'll be fine. Most of all  try not to take his attidude too seriously."
1,i know he uses the scare tactics to weed out the bad students  but give me a break. he red flags me as a trouble maker just coz i actually came to lab on time. lab starts as stated on the schedule at 1:00. i come in at 12:59 says wait outside. bull. lectures are useless. stay home and read the book. also for your own sake take sato or gober for lab
3,Prof. Vandergrift is an excellent professor.by that  i dont mean he's easy. its not him  its the students. it would always depend on you and only you. its a hard class c'mon now... but he's doing his share and its gonna be ok if you do your share too...people who are saying he's worst  are those that wants to get away with this class easily..
2.5,I rated the easiness a 1 for the avg person who knows nothing about Anat. Rude and uptight? He's just a grumpy guy who is bored. (quite humerous). Take him if you think you have what it takes. He's not easy  but the class is doable for an A. He's very lenient on grading  just show that you're hardworking and do reasonably well on the tests.
5,He is very knowledgeable about a lot of things. Very good instructor. Don't be late. I enjoyed having him.
3,he's an ok teacher  sometimes he scares the students. He scares the students at first
5,Attendance is mandatory  but he makes that clear on the first day. (Seriously  why is it so hard for peeps to go to class?) 3 easy quizzes  4 online discussions  a final exam  and a final 8-10 page paper. Incredibly organized! Textbooks and lectures are dense but informative. Great polysci professor!
2,Attendance is mandatory  lectures are very boring. Spends 20-30 mins talking about current events at the beginning of each class. For this class  almost all of your grade comes from finals week. Final paper (8-10 pages) + exam are worth more than everything else done in the class combined  which is unnecessarily stressful!
5,Prof. Burbank definitely knows his stuff. We always talked about current events for the first 20-30 minutes of class before jumping into lecture. His lectures are occasionally boring  but that was more the subject than him. If you read the text there isn't a big need to go to class.
5,I will admit Prof Burbank is a difficult grader  but I appreciate the high standard and always find myself working harder for difficult graders. I have taken numerous courses from Burbank and easily he is one professor I greatly admire and respect. I've certainly learned a lot from him.
2.5,Nice guy  but not a good instructor. He is boring and has nothing interesting to say. He is also an extremely difficult grader.
1,No Comments
3,"Nice guy. Starts quotes with ""Gee..."" which gets irritating. Knows his material. Trys not to play favorites  but the suck ups seems to get through (you know who you are). I would recommend him based on his warm personality and ability to convey detailed analyses with little trouble."
5,Extremelly knowledgable.
5,About to graduate and Ewa's classes remain the most memorable. If you are passionate and interested in the topic she is teaching  you will learn more than you intended to. The one thing that helped me earn an A in every class of hers was CONTACTING HER. She wants to help her students! I had phone meetings with her before every paper. Ewa is amazing
1,Be prepared to read over 100 pages a week along with all of your other classes. Also be prepared to write very detailed essays. Don't think you're gonna get by with anything to basic. This is a 2000 class so the fact that she requires such detailed writing is kind of ridiculous. The difficulty of this class rivals many of my upper division courses.
4,This class has A LOT of reading so be prepared to stay up to date on the homework  but everything assigned is very interesting. She is good at grading and responding to messages in a reasonable time. I genuinely learned a lot from this class!
2,Hard class with arbitrary requirements. Jams tons of info into her powerpoints and tests on the most random things  and is strict on papers and every mistake brings it down a letter grade. It's hard to do well in this class without studying like crazy. Ewa isn't helpful and feels that it's OK to expect the unreasonable of students. Don't take her.
4.5,I took this class  Anthropology of Humor and Laughter  and many told me it would be very hard. I took it anyway because it seemed interesting. Ewa is interesting  engaging  and her class is easy if you know how to pay attention  write  and apply topics. Easy class. Nice lady.
2.5,Difficult grader  jams lot of info into her power points. Doesn't give you good feed back.
1,Avoid this class and professor at all costs. Lectures are a long convoluted mess that do little to further your knowledge. Ewa is one of those unapproachable  apparently infallible  professors whose exams will straight up fail an entire class. After which she will spend a good chunk of the next class making demeaning remarks to you and your peers.
2.5,I took the online class. The multiple choice exams were pretty straightforward  the questions are taken from her powerpoints which are very detailed and helpful. We had to write 3 reflection papers  and I did well on the first one however not so well on the others. However  she was more flexible with the final grade.
3,"Her class was a three hour lecture where she talked nonstop. Pretty impressive really. She definitely knows her stuff. We had three take-home ""tests"" which consisted of several questions which she expected answered like any paper. Lots of research needed to get a good grade. Most people got a C or low B. Very tough class."
2,Clarity is not one of her attributes  could be that english is not her first tongue.
3,Honestly one of my favorite professors. I am through with my undergrad but her lectures are the ones I remember with great fondness.
2.5,Ewa is tough. You will learn more than you ever thought you would. Three exams and two papers due. She assigns a TON of reading. I am taking five classes and half of my study time is just for her class alone. She'll make you work for the grade  as all good professors should. Really interesting stuff - just make sure you have the time!
1,This professor is confusing to say the least. Essays questions are VERY unclear and she will not budge a millimeter when grading. If you want to get an A you need to write a turn paper for every assignment. I took this class to fill upper level class requirements and it turned into a nightmare. I am a very good student but she is so condescending!
1,"Condescending rude and arrogant!0 Tact! Test questions are ambiguous as are paper critiques. She attacks students privately submitted work through discussion posts. If you paraphrase and reword research and give credit to your sight source she will still give you an ""E"" for plagiarism. BEWARE!3 cr hr class w/ an easy 23-25 hr pr week work load."
1,While the content she lectures on is very interesting and done well. You will struggle to meet seemingly arbitrary expectations on the essay tests. Then as a added bonus  your class will receive a lecture in broken English on how bad your English skills are. The novelty of these occurrences fades quickly. I would not recommend this course.
2.5,This class was awful  the book was so confusing and difficult to use (she wrote the book). The lectures were mildly interesting  but didn't seem to have any continuity. I would not recommend this class.
3.5,I took this class freshman year and it was super challenging but really interesting. You have to work your ass off if you expect to have a good grade. It's hard to pin down exactly how she wants you to answer questions in the essay  but she's happy to work with you. Lovely woman!
5,I took Ewa's class freshman year  which I wouldn't recommend for everyone. I absolutely bombed my first test
2.5,She is extremely interesting and has some adventurous stories! She's a tough grader  and sometimes it's hard to understand the point she's trying to make  or follow what she's saying in class. It's interesting  but I don't think all the work was worth it for a gen ed. She has some interesting opinions on religion  and she will attack your beliefs.
2,She's a ruthless grader. Study groups are your best bet  but even then expect to score a lower grade than usual. She has no problem failing most of the class. Ewa tends to throw questions out of left field  and often it seems that there is an excess of overlap between questions. I do not recommend Ewa Wasilewska.
3,"He makes some difficult concepts accessible  and you can definitely learn a lot from his lectures  which are engaging. However  he tends to take a very particular view of a lot of contractual issues and principles  and is quite hard on students if they don't get ""exactly"" the answer he is looking for--this makes exams more difficult to do well on."
5,Professor Pratt is the best professor that I have ever had at Queen's law. He cares deeply about his students and you can tell that enjoys teaching. He is friendly  hilarious  and makes even the dull aspects of contract law interesting. I wish I was able to take more classes with him as I know he has tremendously improved my legal reasoning.
4.5,Probably the best professor at Queen's Law. Friendly  engaging  and knows the material cold. His evaluations are challenging but fair. Plus  the dude is jacked. Highly recommended.
4.5,He challenges his students and tries to get students to go beyond what was written in the case and think about the larger concepts surrounding contract law. Clearly explains complicated topics. Not an easy marker but not impossible.
4,Pratt seems to really enjoy teaching and this is rare. His classes (this is the second I've taken with him) are challenging  but this is as it should be in law school. If you are looking for the easy B+ or A  don't take a class with him.
1.5,Advanced Contracts - Could have been good but Pratt mishandled the class organization and it was all over the place. i.e. reading requriements sent at 8 hours before class  unclear expectations  class was a philosophical cf  was not impressed.
5,An excellent prof. always willing to go out of his way and assist students. Makes contract law interesting. More of a philosophical approach. Will definitely take future classes with him.
5,Professor Pratt is great. He's one of those teachers who you can just feel enjoy teaching. You never feel intimidated to ask a question and he never gives you attitude for asking questions in person as opposed to in front of the class.
5,Michael Pratt is probably an ideal professor. He's clearly intelligent and engaged  and he makes a potentially boring subject (Contracts) interesting. Plus  he's warm and generous to his students. One of the best professors I've had in my many years of being a student.
4.5,One of the best professors I've ever had - made the potentially boring subject matter interesting. I've never had a prof who cares so much about his students - I'm taking all of his classes in the future!
5,Great professor  not the easiest grader - but definatley worth it - really cares about his students and puts in a great effort - highly recommend! - great man
3.5,No Comments
5,A superior professor.
1,Pratt should never  ever have become a professor.
4,No Comments
2,Prof Critelli is clearly a clever person  but I do not enjoy his reasoning. I believe he is an old school conservative professor and that is toi obvious in his way of thinking. He is not neutral in his thoughts and would take a class with him.
5,Honestly one of the best classes I took. He divides the semester into three major portions and his exams are only on what the material that was covered previously. He does give a cumulative  but its not a regular cumulative. He lets you decide what you would like to discuss out of the topics that were covered throughout the semester. Best teacher!!
4,He's Hilarious. I had to go to is office hours which really helped.
4,he is such an awesome guy and really loves phil. Only hw is readings from the text and 3 tests (all essay style). Easy grader yet hard material. Def challenges your mind to a whole other level. Lectures are interesting so make sure you attend. Doesnt really have lecture notes so you must do the reading.
5,Dr. Critelli is an AMAZING Professor! He makes you think outside of the box and challenges you to be out of your comfort zone. There's a reason he says things so don't think he's entertaining you. Take good notes and read the text to do well in the class. Make sure to go to his office hours  he will help you out! I wish he taught more classes.
4.5,Wonderful teacher of any class in Philosophy. You are guaranteed to learn a lot.
5,An outstanding veteran of college professors  Professor Critelli's Philo 2 class was very thought-provoking as well as interesting even when I had little to no interest in the subject prior to signing up. The reading is supplementary  as noted  so take thorough notes when you take his class
4,Great teacher  really challenges your mind and point of thought. Funny guy as well  Critelli made class amusing and lectured in a way that kept his students interested. The material is complicated  but he is always willing to re explain if you dont understand. I would definitely recommend him!
5,TAKE HIM! HE REALLY LOVES WHAT HE TEACHES  AND HE'S VERY VERY FUNNY. NEVER BORING. HE'S VERY HELPFUL WITH TESTS  AND GRADES EASY. ITS HELPFUL TO READ THE CHAPTERS TO UNDERSTAND HIS NOTES. ONLY DO ABOUT 10 SEGMENTS FROM THE ENTIRE BOOK. BUT SERIOUSLY TAKE HIM!! DON'T SECOND GUESS IT. NO HOMEWORK OTHER THAN READING. TAKE HIM!
4,FASCINATING & THOUGHT PROVOKING. Still thinking about the things I learned in his class. 3 in class essays  if you don't take one or two you can make your final 100% of your grade. TAKE HIM!
5,Dr. Critelli is an absolutely amazing professor! He makes you critically thinking and challenge yourself beyond your expectation at every class meeting but its is very well worth it! Take goood notes  for your notes are your study guide. He is extremely helpful and if you're completely stuck he allows you to call him.He is by far the best professor
5,Very challenging (in a good sense) and very thought provoking!!!!
5,Dr. Critelli is the best professor I've ever had. Should I be fortunate enough to achieve some success in life  I'll attribute some of it to Dr. Critelli expanding my horizons. If I could keep him as my professor  I'd change majors.
5,LOVE THIS MAN. HE'S A LUNATIC AND ITS AWESOME. I STOP BY AND SIT IN HIS CLASS JUST FOR FUN. YOU THE MAN CRITELLI.
5,Critelli is out of this WORLD. He'll make you laugh so hard you can't breathe. Critelli will go over the material over and over but in different hilarious ways. I use to pretend I didn't understand the reading so that he would explain it again and again because he made it so fun. I would definitly take him again.
5,dr. critelli is the best professor i've ever had. lectures were fun to attend and you leave class feeling that you've actually learned something. i wish he taught more than just phil. 2 because i would take another one of his classes even though it has nothing to do with my major.
5,I would take his class a hundred times!!! The most hilarious man I have ever known. If it came down to hanging out with friends or going to Critelli's class  I would not hesitate to cancel plans with friends.
4,Critelli is hilarious. His lectures are confusing  but that's because of the subject matter  not him. He wants everyone to get an A and does his best to clarify the material  no matter how many times you need him to go over it. Take this class!
4.5,I took his class becasue of the comments on this website. I couln't be more glad. Love his sense of humor. Very considerate of the working adults. Didn't get to talk to him personally but I could tell he's a great person who cares. Class: Challenging but great! would take him again in a heartbeat!!!
5,His lectures are GREAT. He adds humor....which is good because it was an evening class and he kept us awake. He involved us all in his lectures. His tests are difficult essay questions  but if you study the notes you will do ok.
5,He is a very sweet professor and does a great job to make sure we pass while understanding all of the concepts. I loved his class.
5,His class is fail proof! As long as you turn in all the excel assignments before the final you will be able to get full credit for them. That means you probably don't have to show up for the class. His assignments are very detailed which are meant to help you out. He tells a lot of jokes and is very sweet. Only a 10-week course!
5,This is an easy pass class and Mike is a super nice guy. He is always trying to help people and is understanding. Just don't miss class because then you have to do the class work at home.
5,Nicest professor I've encountered. You'll pass the course if you turn in every assignment. Overall  I would recommend him to anyone and it's the easiest course I've taken.
5,Mike is the best  amazing teacher great guy so funny  overall the best man out there.
5,He is super caring and actually wants everyone to pass. Let's you work through the excel assignments as you need to at your own pace. the class is kind of set in a way that the assignments are online and you kinda just sit in class and work on them. He has like little sheets you turn in as proof of doing the work.
5,He is honestly one of the sweetest people I have encountered. He is so kind and genuine and really cares about his students. The class is an easy A  and he is a very very good person.
5,It was a good Excel class. I entered without knowing how to use Excel and this class helped a lot. You can complete your assignment at home and print a screenshot of a part of your work to turn in the next class. Attendance is taken every class. I learned a lot overall and I enjoyed this class!
5,He is an incredibly caring professor and genuinely wants all of his students to pass. It's a credit/no credit class so it's really hard to fail unless you don't do any of the assignments. He believes in all of his students and is probably one of the sweetest professors at SJSU.
5,Easiest teacher for this course. Barely any effort required and easy final. 2 Assignments a week  Group project  and Final. Take him for that easy pass on 91L
5,1 classwork and 1 homework assignment is due each week. This class only meets once a week for 10 weeks so I think the work is fair and extremely easy. He wants all his students to pass. You have to sign in every class but you can leave as soon as you finish your classwork. Highly recommend!
5,Extremely chill. 2 weekly assignments  one in class  one for homework. He tells cheesy jokes every class and is super cool. It is a credit/no credit class and he grades mostly off of participation (completion of assignments). Very easy class with only a little bit of experience with excel.
5,Go to class! Mike is very understanding so if you have conflicting responsibilities  talk to him. Takes late work. You can do assignments ahead of time and only show up to class for 15 minutes to get it checked. Encourages talking in class. Assignment grades based on whether you do them or not  not correctness. Allows internet usage/notes on exam.
5,Prof Splane is the cutest professor ever. He really cares about you learning. He created all his assignments himself  and really wants students to get a good understanding so they have the most potential when they get out of college. Loved his class :-)
4.5,Great professor! Must take his class!
5,He's a great guy and a great prof! Just go to class and you'll ass. 1 in class  1 homework assignment every week. Time consuming but easy. Helps you learn a lot about excel in a way that will actually help you in the real world. I can't stress enough to take him.
5,What can I say that hasn't already been said? Mike is a wonderful guy and a great professor. Designed the entire course and materials himself with the students in mind. Essentially a self paced class. I actually learned a ton of great excel skills too! Imagine that  a course that is low stress  relatively easy  and where you learn valuable skills.
5,Really good teacher  one of the best I have ever had! Joke of the day is awesome. Just put in a little work  he is very very helpful and understanding  never had an issue with submitting assignments a little late. I actually lost data on my computer and couldn't submit my homework  he genuinely felt sorry for me :p Very nice guy. Totally recommend.
5,Fun class  easy teacher and he's always smiling. Just show up do the assignment for the day and get an A! Joke of the day is the best
5,Very unique class format  as we do the talking instead of him. It's more of us self-learning  with Splane as the one overseeing things. Big perk about this course is that the textbook is online  so it's practically clear cut. Mac users will have slight issues  but it can be worked around. If Mike's available to teach  then take his class!
5,If you miss a class  make it up. Do not wait till the end to makeup the classes or you may run out of options or time
5,She is so fun! Just make sure to not miss class  but even if you do  she allows as many makeup classes as you want! She's super cool.
4.5,She is a wonderful instructor for yoga. I enjoyed the class and she worked with me on doing other positions if I could not do what others could because of an injury/surgery. She is very mindful of that.
3.5,Fun and interesting class  great for beginners.
4.5,Best yoga instructor I've had! She is very enthusiastic and inspirational!
3,Very fun class! Takes a while to get the hang of it.
5,OMG Best teacher ever! I was a complete noob before I took her Yoga and Zumba classes and I was hooked ever since. She's really funny and points out the good/bad postures to everyone. She doesn't make me feel bad for being a fatty and she recognizes good effort.
2.5,She only likes the people who know what they're doing and if you don't do it right after two weeks she makes you feel like an idiot. I liked what she was teaching but she's a bit arrogant about it. Beginners beware!
5,Kim is excellent and makes Zumba lots of fun. But it would be good if she would turn the volume down. Loud music is bad for our hearing and hers!!
5,Kim Fujii is by far the best yoga instructor  especially if you're new to yoga. She makes it fun  peaceful  and i guarentee you'll feel the difference after her class =)
4.5,Wonderful  knowledgeable instructor
5,Loved this class. Kim is great  she is super friendly and really good at explaining things. This was a great introduction to kinesiology  which helps if you're taking any other anatomy classes
5,I took zumba with her...now like 3 times. It is my favorite class ever!!! I haven't taken many other zumba instructors but as far as i know  she is one of the best. Super energetic  always fun  puts you in a good mood  and makes you sweat like CRAZY!!! You get a tough but super fun workout each time. Take it! you don't have to know how to move/danc
5,Amazing instructor. I've took her Zumba course and it is the most fun I have had in an exercise class. Choreography is easy to pick up on( that is if you do not have 2 left feet). If the class slacks off  she will give the class a small lecture about how the moves should be done. Normally her ALL of her classes are super crowded. Register early. :]
5,i thought she would be demanding because on the first day she said she was a tough teacher! i'm not flexible  but as the class went on  all her threats were jokes and everyone just laughs and jokes with her. she turned out to be the best fitness teacher i've ever had! she doesnt push you past your limits  and she has alt poses if you cant do a pose
4,She's a scorpio and an only child. She's a giver. You'll know that after taking her summer and fall classes without a break. Great teacher  but very demanding. I'd recommend her personally  but alot of the class drops.
4,Kim rocks the yoga world!
5,Best Yoga Instructor on the Penninsula! Enough said!
5,great workout  and she makes it really fun- if incredibly challenging.
4.5,Really fun  nice person and interesting. She makes the class more personal by adding stories of her own and making us feel relaxed so we will try harder. Funny and cute  wonderful instructor.
1,worst teacher at sjsu...no wonder MIS sjsu grads get crappy jobs..because the interim dean for MIS is the worst teacher in MIS!!!!
5,LOL  all the bad comments came from FROSH taking Bus 111. I took 2 classes with Tim  it's not easy  but I learned and survived. I graduated and appreciate him very much now. He cares about students and wants them to be independent by learning on their own. It is his job to maintain the quality of MIS grads. He's one of the best professors at SJSU.
5,His way of teaching forces the students to become an expert in the topic. Yes you are the one who gives the presentations  so you have to actually go and learn the stuff to be informative to others. Also  unless you are prepared to really learn do not take his class  and come back and whine about his class being hard.
2.5,Make the students do the lectures and grade tests with a grading system of a doctor. Nobody in the class could understand what their test score really is! Tests are extremely long  tedious  and mind-bobbling. going to class will not help you and needless to say he will discourage you from going into MIS. I switch my major after taking his class.
1,we should all get his salary because we are the ones teaching HIS class...hes even intermin dean...good job SJSU! SJSU is #1!
4,Hill knows what he's talking about. He's a real good guy  however  his tests are nearly impossible  they are WAY  to HARD!! I have yet to find a class that has harder tests  and I only have 4 more classes till graduation. Make sure to memorize every definition there is  you will really need it for the tests. Good luck if you take him.
1,I wouldnt call this a class because it is not really a class. Students basically teaching themselves. Weekly quizzes from questions at the end of the book. Exams are tough  but he gives a great curve. Read the BOOK  or else you will struggle with the exmas.
5,I think Prof. Tim is a great instructor. If u want to specialize in Network & Security this is the class. It is true that he want's students to correct the PP slides & teach the class that is for students own advantage. Finally he curvers the class on the grade just do all the work. Attened all classes. Exams are tuff and quizses every day  but don
1.5,He's a nice guy who seems to know his stuff  however he doesnt teach it well at all. He's trying to make students teach themselves by forming groups and make powerpoint presentations for the class. However  this format doesnt work  you dont learn anything  and his tests are impossibly hard. Don't take him if you can avoid it.
4,I think he's a great teacher. Not unlike other teachers  he is willing to make sure you understand the material and spends the time doing so. With that said  his class is not easy. Yes  you have to work hard and read  but in the end it is worth it. If you're in for an easy A  get someone else
1,Lazy teacher  makes you teach the class when he is supposed to  tests are beyond hard  people getting 50's with a curve? skip him for every class...hopefully he will get fired soon.
1.5,I took him both for 118C and 111  if you thought 111 was bad you haven't seen nothing yet. It is the same exact format but more intense. Not recommended  take another elective if you can!!
1.5,Real nice guy  but couldn't teach if his life depended on it. I agree with the previous post  that he is a really lazy teacher. He does not teach the class and makes student teach the class. You would think why you pay for the class if your only teaching yourself. His test are extremely hard. NOT recommended at all.
1,I found this guy to be a very lazy teacher. He is too lazy to lecture so he has you form teams to know your part of the section. Quizzes and test are hard. The curve is not all that great because it dont boost your grade much. Not recommended at all take other professors if you can.
3,Hill is a nice guy. Class is unconventional since students have to read the chapters and present to the class while Hill comments. As a result  class moves really slow and some students do a half ass job. Tests are insanely hard but the curve really helps. Participation really counts towards your grade. Assigns a ton of reading and labs.
4.5,Good professor. Had a lot of group work. That is all the class is. You need to teach yourself because he will not lecture. He will emphisise main points in your PowerPoint presentations. Crazy ass curve for midterms/exams. No quizes at all. Particiation is a must. Uses WebCT for that. Labs were fun and easy credit.
5,Best MIS professor  hands down. Cares about his students and is always approachable. Tests are long and comprehensive but the curve is insane  so don't sweat it. Genuinely seems interested in the course material. Very passionate about computing  and he uses a mac so I will give him points just for that fact.
4.5,Tim Hill rocks! His teaching method was a bit unconventional this semester. He made us  the students  teach ourselves. His tests are pretty hard but he curves the midterm and final so don't sweat it. The best advice I can give is attend class and make sure to participate in WebCT.
5,Dr. Hill is one of the best and most passionate MIS teachers. all the people who don't like him should honestly consider changing their major. He expects that you read the book which is short and good. his tests are very tricky cuz u have to link concepts but he does hook it up with a nice curve. he cares a LOT about students and teaching.
5,One of the best instructors in the MIS department.Have to study a lot but if you pay attention in class you will surely get an A.
1.5,Ok so this class was boring and too easy but the teacher complicated it. She takes EVERYTHING from the book even explanations which arent really worth while because they might not make sense to you. SO get yourself a real good tutor for this class
1,she is the most horrible teacher ever and there is no way that everyone could either fail or have to drop that class if she was a decent teacher!
2,i'm taking the same math i took in 8th grade and i can't understand it cause she's new and has no idea how to teach it. get a diff teacher if you can
2,Not a great teacher
3,He's a great guy! BUT.... he can be confusing and particular (HE wrote his textbook  so it also doesn't help)..often feel like things have to be HIS WAY exactly...which is frustrating. Knows a lot about music  but not always easiest to understand. Felt like I shouldn't have been so frustrated in an intro to music class  esp with prior knowledge.
2,He is crazy and does not give a lot of guidelines for your work but then when he critiques it he is very particular. I never knew what he was looking for.
3.5,Wow! This guy is a genious! For real though...check out his work or google him...he really knows what he teaches but yeah he's a great teacher! A lot of learning going on and he gives great ideas and tips...take him!
5,Good teacher  gives good advice on my work  but sometimes I feel like he needs to let my art be MY art. But other than that he's a great professor.
5,great guy.
5,No Comments
5,Yeah John Greenland!
5,awsome guy
5,great guy
5,He is a wonderful professor!! Very helpful and easy to learn from!! If you have a choice take a class with Allen!!
4.5,Ok so I am not a math person  but Mr. Aldridge does a fantastic job demystifying mathmatics and is very clear about the subject. Highly reccomended
5,Aldridge is as well my all time favorite teacher. Key words: predictable  un-flaky  cheerful  helpful  REAL. This prof makes me fear using another teacher for my math courses. He not only knows how to teach  but he runs an understandable ship. There are NO surprises  and the fact that he will go above the call of duty to help is evident. DA MAN! 
5,one thing to remember in his class is that its an easy A. all you have to do is write down whatever he writes  b/c what he writes is on the quiz. if one wants to make an easy C  just pay attention on the day of a quiz when he goes over the chapter. make sure people ask questions b4 test b/c more questions means more answers!!!!
5,My favorite teacher ever! I love him!
5,This guy is really helpful. You do a lot of problems for homework  but then the next day he asks for questions. He would work the problem on the board and explain it. I actually got this stuff and I s*ck at math. Nice guy.
4,Dr Uzman is a fun-loving professor and I think he wants you to have fun while learning. The class is not very hard
4,This class was extremely hard. He expects a lot from students...almost like grad school. He really knows his stuff and if you ask a question you almost always get an answer in the form of another question. His tests are really really hard. be prepared to work your ass off.
2,This class was about using the internet to learn about proteins/enzymes structures  sequences etc.. To begin with.. 1)terrible book  it made a fun subject boring 2)we sat in front of a computer and never used it  he lectured all 2 hours straight. 3)we're suppose to be learning how to use the internet for this stuff (continued in next comment)
2,but he is lecturing on molecular bio and biochem stuff 3) he is asking us all mo bio and biochem questions even though the prereq for this class is only genetics. The final was looking up protein info online  but he never taught us that (which is THE MAIN THING!)  we had to teach it to ourselves. If you ask for help he just confuses you more.
3,Taught at graduate level. Class is applied! He's nice  but ask a question and get an answer with a question so if you need help make sure you are really prepared before asking. This makes it intimidating asking for help. Be ready to study a lot and find a study partner(a suck-up will help you best)
3,He is a nice character  and he provides the questions before the tests  and also gives oportunities for group solving of his assignments. That's because the course itself is a very hard one  one of the hardest I've taken.
3,You have to be at a collegiate level. You do not want to take him if you a non-biology major. He makes things harder than what they should be. However if you are a studious person and are wiling to do lots of work you will learn a lot from him.
4.5,Very goofy. Very mind challenging but very interesting and fun.
4.5,He seems to teach well. He is somewhat prepared for class
5,I took her for summer online  she was easy to get a hold of and has all your work put up the first day just don't wait till last min to do work. She gave plenty of time to do final and quizzes. I also had two discussion papers to write that are around 6 paragraphs. Overall an easy class  make sure you do work in a timely manner.
3,I took her online social psych class  and the class is just reading the book and doing homework out of it. There's about 3 or 4 chapters w/ approx. 4 assignments eahc due in a month. It can be a lot  but just pace yourself and do things early and you can get everything done. However the stuff that you read is really interesting and eye opening.
4,The only reason I gave this professor a 4 was because of her lack of communication and her assignments were not clear 70% of the time. I took her online class ( I recommend if you want an A) I passed with an A because I did all the work on time  that's really all you have to do. Not hard at all  can be confusing at times that's all.
5,I took the online spring course and it was easy. Yes  you will have to read the whole book  but it's interesting information. The test and quizzes were simple and easy if you read the chapters. She answered all my questions in a timely manner. She uses a point system instead of grades  which I actually liked. I would take her again.
5,Dr. Douglas is so helpful! I had a mishap with the textbook company  they put me in the wrong class. For 5/8 weeks was working on the WRONG material. Annoying but she was understanding and gave me an extension for the material to be turned in! 1 paper  online quizzes/tests. Read and TRY and you'll be fine! Very respectful/responsive. TAKE HER!
3,She is a very nice teacher but you defiantly cannot slack in her class. Quizzes were given every week so reading was a must and so was attendance.
1.5,Prof was rude and condescending. Asked for help on multiple occasions and felt like she was annoyed that I had any questions in an online course. She did not communicate effectively and gave short notice of deadline changes. Overall the class was neither challenging nor helpful and was generally unpleasant. Would not recommend.
3,She uses a point system that confused most of the students. We had quizzes everyday over the chapters. Tests weren't too hard but she did provide one extra credit assignment.
5,I just love her . easy class ! Work on your own pace it was and is good
4.5,Took this class online. Very straight forward. At the end of each week four chapter tests were due along with four separate responses to each chapter. She allowed for the test to be taken twice keeping the highest of the two grades. The final exam could only be taken once. Commit to reading the book. She has no problem answering questions.
3,This class is pretty much self pace  but if you get behind it will be hard to recover. Try to complete a test a week.
3.5,As im sure she loves what she does  her teaching method was not for me. If you are a self learner then you will be bored in this class. Read the book and follow the online assignments and you will pass. This is part of my major and i didnt learn anything from the teacher. Also  READ THE SYLLABUS  explains her grading style.
1,I did not like this professor at all  she's rude  condescending  and belittling to her students. She never actually gets to the point of what she's trying to say  so understanding anything in her class is really difficult  and then she makes you feel stupid for not understanding and having to ask questions. I would never recommend taking her class.
1.5,She doesnt really email you about anything  excpet to tell the entire class if your not doing your work then to drop. Her way of grading is really confusing and she is kind of rude.
3,Karen Douglas was a good lecturer but we have weekly chapters to read and weekly (sometimes twice a week) quizzes. The quiz questions came from a question bank  and she didn't check the questions over before putting them on the quiz! A lot of times the questions wouldn't make sense. But  the one group presentation was easy  if you got a good team.
1,DO NOT TAKE!She is unhelpful and super rude if you ask her a simple question she gives you a condescending answer and makes you feel stupid. She doesn't make things clear and there are way too many quizzes the last few weeks you will have two a day. I really feel like she sets people up for failure
1,Terrible she is not helpful when a student doesn't understand she is very harsh and makes them feel very stupid. Maybe she is better online but I had her for in person but in my opinion she was not a very good teacher. I can say I do not feel like I had a chance to connect with the material because it was not taught very well.
4,Took Dr. Douglas Developmental Psychology during the summer and it was super easy. Only negative I can say is she didn't grade the one and only writing assignment in a timely manner  but still recommend her class.
4.5,Great instructor. Crystal clear about her expectations. I had her for Gen Psych and Lifespan. Would take her again in a heartbeat. It's entirely up to you if you want an A.
2,Professor Douglas didn't grade assignments in a timely fashion so you were always left wondering and she didn't give comments as to why she didn't give you the full amount of points. You have to read and memorize the chapters if you want to pass the quizzes and these are 50+ page chapters! All in all I would not recommend taking her class.
5,Easily one of the most intelligent professors you will ever meet. Classes are difficult but certainly not impossible. Dr Ball is helpful and wants her students to succeed. Put in the effort  and she will make an effort to help you. If you come prepared for class and take notes  Dr. Ball's classes should be one of your best experiences at Alma.
4,EHS 225 was a hard class but she made it easier to understand. Her only downfall is that her voice can get boring during lectures
5,Super smart woman! A definite asset to anyone's education.
5,We love her :-)
2,He was a terrible teacher. He could not answer questions. His quiz and test questions were unclear and there is never a word bank. He counts answers wrong for spelling. He took too long in the beginning of the semester and rushed through the end. We didn't even make it to the last 2 chapters. DO NOT TAKE HIM! Class started with 28 and ended with 9.
5,Anatomy is a hard class. You have to study if you want to pass. Quiz  lab/exam test and masteramp help a lot in the final grade. Great guy  smart and funny.
5,Prof. Wernli is an awesome professor. If you are looking for an 'easy' A  you won't find it in A&P. He's a fair professor but you still have to earn your grade. Attend class  Study the notes he gives  read the book and you'll have no problem earning that A. Plus he's very helpful and willing to answer your questions.
4,he is easy prof compare to my previous one. have quiz subjects on his web before quiz. tests were little hard but i guess that's A&P. write down his lecture. overall  good teacher :)
5,OMG! this professor is amazng. Everyone should take him. Although his tests are a little hard with studying you should come out with a c or higher. But dont think that you can get by without even trying a little! Wernli makes you laugh and loves biology. He's a honest to good man who loves to help his students. I recommend him anytime!
5,Prof Wernli makes it really hard to make a bad grade in his class. He's very clear on what will be on his exams and gives many quizzes of which he keeps only the top 10 grades. He will bend over backwards to help you if you just ask. Attend class and study. I made an A. Very nice man  sweet and young at heart. :)
4.5,He is awesome  strict but if you do the work you will get the grade. He is very helpful pay attention to the powerpoints and notes  know the material backwards and foreward for your own benefit.
4.5,He is such a nice guy willing to help in anyway.Makes learning fun with his jokes  and also gives you tricks on how to learn most of the material.Puts up power points and drops a lot of low grades  keeps top 10 quizzes. Totally recommend.Great teacher!
4.5,Alls you have to do is study! And go to class because if you miss it throws off the rythim you where in. He is a great teacher. really funny and very helpful. I am so glad I signed up for his course!
4,THE BEST!!!!!!! He will soon start teaching A&P :)
4,Prof.Wernli is a great Teacher  pretty funny and very informative. Sometimes he gets off track but it helps if your taking him Flex in a 4 hour class. Weekly quizzes and extreme use of the textbook. Biology for Science Major.
3.5,Let me start by saying no science course is easy. Especially biology. Mr. Wernli gives weekly quizez and keeps only your 10 best grades. there are 3 lecture test and 3 lab test. The lab test are easy if you study the lecture tests are hard! you really have to study your notes! if you are up for the challenge take him. over all hes ok. :)
5,Professor Wernli is an awesome teacher who really knows his stuff. Don't believe what others tell you  he is the best non-sci biology teacher at SAC. No biology class is going to be easy. If you blow off the class you will fail  but I took 14 hours this semester and have an A in his class.
1.5,For being a non-major Bio  he give too much information. Im an A/B student and im border line passing. Teaching for many years  he assumes that the majority of students already know the info  good for major in Bio. I do not recommend this teacher.
3.5,Took the online course and would recommend this class to anyone who needs it. As long as you read your text  you will do fine. He gives weekly chapter quizzes and has four term papers to turn in. All unit exams are given online  so that makes it easy if you have a hard time going to campus. Study hard for his tests because they can be tricky.
1.5,hard to understand
1,Pretty worthless as a professor
3.5,Way 2 much work for a 5 week summer course. Lecture Tests were way 2 hard & the reviews for them were massive. By the time U answer everything on the review you don't have to much time 2 study. Plus  your only tested on a third of the actual review! Tests look nothing like the review. DO NOT take unless you REALLY have to. (Blended course)
4.5,Hard class  but only if you don't study. Uses powerpoints and videos. Explains things well  tells some jokes in class. Likes to give quizes over material covered. Helpful professor. In this class  which is lab and lecture  he gives a break about halfway thru (2 hr class). Very challenging class  only cuz I'm taking 4 other classes.
5,This was a hard class and I had to spend a lot of time studying but it was all worth it. He's a wonderful teacher and I would take him again if given the chance. As long as you study for this class there is no way you could fail.
5,Cute teacher and passionate about what he does. Easy if you read over lecture notes. Nice guy.
4,Easy class if you review lectures for exams(every other week)  and word/excel tests are easy if you just practice online. Attendance wise  you just need 70% to have 100% and that is tracked by iClicker participation every lecture  so you can miss a few classes because the powerpoints are all posted online. Great teacher  easy class
4,This class is an easy A IF you do well on the lecture exams which can be sort of difficult if you dont study. I showed up to lecture & sat on my phone the whole time but you have to show up for iclicker points. However  you only need to end up with 70% clicker to get 100% so you can miss a good amount. Labs are easy and exams are easy if you study
4,Class is easy to follow  he gives info that is helpful for the future. Testing is practically given to you. No book required. Programming part is step by step. If you have problems with your tech. He will help you with it. Overall great class would take again and he is funny.
4,Glenn is really into computers and tries to instill this love of computers into everyone in the class. Lectures can be a little bor If sometimes but there is a lot of useful information that you can use in everyday life with your computer. If you show up  do Simnet training  and go to lab and put in a little effort it's an easy B/B+.
5,Pretty easy and a pretty funny professor. The tests are easy as long as you study. Don't make it hard on yourself. The word exams are easy A's as well.
3,Lectures are long and boring. Class is easy if you are good with technology (word and excel). Definitely makes you work for your grade!
2,I appreciate how clear Glen has made his grading criteria and class schedule. I just felt as tho his lecture exams had low balled questions on tiny details mentioned in lecture. Word exams are easy A's tho. Didn't enjoy this class  but you might.
3,This isn't a hard class as long as you attend and go to labs. He will never let you out early and he really loves what he teaches  but is a little odd. He expects everyone in the class to love the subject as much as him. Eye clicker is the way he tracks attendance  but attendance is required. He does let you make up missed labs. Just really boring.
3,Will never let out early. Loves the subject. Kinda nerdy. Lectures are dry. Lecture quiz during lab every other week.
5,Glenn is a helpful professor who doesn't want you to fail. Makeup policies are good. You don't need the textbook but need the SIMnet pass which is pricey. Class is easy as long as you show up with the iClicker. Read his lectures before a test and you're good. Also  do the SIMnet tutorials  very helpful!
3.5,Its simple  read the powerpoint lecture slides  do the SIMnet lessons  and don't forget your iclicker and you will get an A. Its simple. Don't make it hard on yourself.
3,This class is as easy as you want to make it. Do the simnet trainings and you will do fine on those tests. get the easy iclicker points. Hardest part is the lecture exams  but they are fine if you show up to class moderately. Funny guy. Satisfies a major business requirement as well.
3,DO NOT miss lecture ... You'll fail the Lecture Exams & won't receive iClicker credit... STUDY for lab tests (Microsoft  Excel  Powerpoint) through Simnet... If you miss class you can learn the information from the text book  but it's not as easy to understand so I don't recommend it
3,pay attention to the lectures because you will have a lecture test every two weeks in the lab and make sure to do the trainings online or you won't pass. If you study a little you can easily get a b in the class.
5,Glenn is the best person I've ever known  let alone best professor. He inspires me in so many ways  I have lost track. His choice in flowy  big print shirts  impeccable. Take this class if you want to have the time of your life  while learning basic computer skills.
4.5,Glen is a goof ball. He's super clear and very understanding of the students. He talks A LOT and often repeats things  but at least you wont forget what's going onwhen tests are. If you practice for the SIMnet quizzes you will pass. The lecture quizzes were a little more difficult  but probably cause I didn't always pay attention during lectures.
2.5,I really love this teachers enthusiasm  but the subject still bores me. Be ready for his long useless talking about nothing  but try to enjoy his sense of humor if you can. Study please  i wish i could fix my grade.
5,I came into this class knowing nothing and had a complete lack of interest in anything to do with computers. Now I am going to minor in Computer Science! Glenn was amazing and makes things understandable for those with little to no knowledge of computers. Lecture quizzes are tough  but the labs are what really saved my grade.
3.5,This class was so freaking hard. I'm sure its easy for mathsciency people.. but this was just really confusing to me. The lecture was so freaking boring. he is a nice man though!!
1,Most unhelpful college instructor ever! Her exams are very confusing and don't reflect her lectures. You can be a great note taker and do your best and read the text boooks but for the exams and papers  unless you write specifically what her opnions are on the subject she will fail you. Many of her questions on the exam are subjective & unclear
2.5,Avoid her if you want to pass or get a good grade. Her tests are extremely hard and you don't have enough time to deal with them...BTW..she's out there to trick you everytime on the exams and her project is impossible
2,Tests are extremely hard!! She knows her stuff!!
3,She is hard  but a genius
2.5,DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS!! She gives ridiculous amounts of work and is a VERY HARD grader!!!! She doesn't believe in giving good grades! WATCH OUT!
3,Horrible teacher  impossible tests  big project  no compassion for students  big attitude problem. DO NOT TAKE HER!
3,She's very hard teacher. She expects everyone to know everything. She doesn't help at all. very mean and very rude. Tests are hardest!! Don't take her. I hate this teacher. She doesn't teach that much but she gives a big project that didn't mean a lot.
4,She is smart but TOUGH   OMG  I learned so much
5,She is a great teacher. Her tests are hard but you will remember what you learned.
4,knows her stuff and can really make it interesting BUT  don't cross her..keep up with the reading 'cause she can figure out who is not reading
3,Subject matter is tough but Dr. Eng knows her stuff - tests are hard and her project is very time-consuming. If you put a lot of effort into the class  do the reading  and ace the project  you'll do fine. You will work for your grade in this class  but you will learn a lot. I would take her again.
2,ugh  shes a smart lady but arrogant. She talks to you like you're dumb when you ask a question. She contradicts the textbook on the tests. Cancels classes and you pretty much have to teach yourself everything  but you'll still be wrong. DONT take if it's an elective. You'll most likely be stuck with her  so good luck.
2,No Comments
2,Shes a pretty good professor  she gives really good clinical examples when she lectures. Her tests are another story. You would think its going to be easy but they are straight from the licensure exam so study hard. And if you must present a project to the class make sure you know your stuff inside and out. Ive seen her rip students apart.
3.5,She is not horrible like everyone says. She is very nice. Very intelligent and passionate about her field. Her tests are harder than usual  because they are like the license exam. But I quickly got the hang of them and did pretty well. Her project is long  but not that hard when you get the hang of it. You learn alot!
1.5,Smart women  but not a good teacher.

2,She bases the grade on whether she likes u or not. Her tests are VERY tricky! Shes not approachable & makes students feel stupid. She makes her grad students grade her tests  so double check ur grade! The average grade she gives is a C  So dont expect and A. She gives back all ur tests @ the end so u go an entire semester not knowing where u stand
3.5,Professor Eng knows the subject matter quite well the only complaint I have is how she arrives at the final grade....it doesnt reflect what students do throughout the semester.
5,Great professor and always lets you out early. Tests were all curved up and ended up with an easy A
4,2 exams  Mid Term and Final. Take notes in class and read the text book 2 days before exams  easy A. Mid-term was so easy that I believe he curved down  I don't see anyone getting lower than 85%. Make sure you attend the two classes before the mid-term and final  he will tell you what to study. Material he teaches is very dry.(all theory)
2,This Professor is a total flake! He barely understands economics  his lectures are incomprehensible and he is just an overall joke! If you go to class and then read the book you will be fine for the tests but beware! If you don't get a between a 90 and 100 you will be getting a B! My overall score was an 89 and he said he had to curve down. BS!
2.5,Don't take this professor if you want to learn more more than the basics. He gets VERY confused when he encounters any higher level concepts  thus you won't be learning much from him. I wish I had only attended the days before the 2 exams where he gave us all the material in a nice and concise form. Otherwise  the semester wasa complete waste.
4,very good prof and a nice guy. only two tests. no homework  no takehome stuff  nada. all you have to do is go to class and you'll get an A.
3,Great guy. Gives you an A if you study. 2 exams and gives you the answers to the test  the week before. Take him!
5,Very good professor & a great class...good teacher & grader...what else a student needs?
2.5,Great guy. Very helpful and gives you the answers to both exams in the class prior to the exam. Not need to read the book. I read the whole thing and it was not worth it. Take him!
2.5,For those who hate economics  take this guy for an easy easy A. 2 tests  be sure to label your axis well  draw the diagram he gives you the first day of class on the midterm. He gives the answers to the tests the class before the test.
5,Dr. Mahmood is a Great Teacher!
3.5,F'N Waste of Time! Nothing new  Attendance 10% and a midterm joke (draw the flow chart) and Final (straight from the book) no need going to class  just go to the last class prior to test. Both book and Prof are wrong when it comes to stats (like sum-of-sq
2,His teaching is BAD. He doesn't understand the basic concepts of economics. You won't learn anything from this class because there is nothing new  all the stuff you already know from high school and undergrad (even that he is wrong in many basic theories)
5,By far my favorite professor at MSU!! He is absolutely brilliant  and an overall genuine person. He will relate the class material to every day situations which will help you understand it better. If you pay attention in class  the tests are simple. Definitely take him !:)
1,Professor Caspi was super cool at first but then he did a complete 180. He's a tough grader and doesn't help when he'll is needed  does give good feedback  but he is no help. I learned nothing from the class. It was mainly theory and psychologist based which takes a lot to understand but he didn't care if you were confused. Avoid him if you can.
3.5,He is a great guy  very funny and the class was not boring at all. He does not teach from power points  so expect to be writing down what he says in class. The readings are important to do. Class consisted of 2 canvas postings  one quiz  group presentation  and a cumulative final.
3.5,"I've read a lot of reviews about how Dr. Caspi is ""emotionless"" but he does try to notice and get to know your personality but you have to be open! I'd have my off days and he'd always notice and he genuinely cared. In regards to the class  he likes messing with your head but its a good learning tool for this specific class. I found it interesting."
4.5,I liked Dr. Caspi for this class! His classes could sometimes be boring and drag on  but at the end you do learn a lot. Try not to take his humor to heart.. he has a tendency to make jokes to/about students. But all in good fun!
4.5,Prof. Caspi is a great teacher! Kind of a smart ass sometimes but he makes class so interesting and time really flies by. I would definitely take him again! His workload is manageable and you actually learn something.
5,Excellent teacher! Loved his class  we had a blast! He taught me a lot and got me interesting in siblings and family theories!!!
1,He is pretty much one of the most useless professors at Montclair. I don't really have anything to say about him other than the fact that he is useless and a miserable human being. What a shame too  because the FCST department is full of wonderful professors. Unfortunately for him he just cannot compare. Take somebody else.
4,He is a good prof. but BIG on APA format. You will have journal entries but can email him to look over b4 handing in. Overall interesting class.
5,Great professor. Go to class  participate  READ the material and it is an easy A!
4,He's definitely not a creep! Dr. Caspi is a great teacher  and I learned so much from him. You have to go to class and the work is fair and reasonable. He likes students that make an attempt to speak up in class and give their input. Overall-a great professor!!
2.5,He's a creep.
4.5,I had Caspi for Research and Child in the Community. I dont know what everyone is talking about. He is SO good! Compared to the other research profs  he doesnt give HUGE reports bc he honestly doesnt wanna have to sit and read b.s. fluff  WHICH IS AWESOME FOR US! People say he is a hard grader b/c people dont understand he just wants the facts. TA
5,This class was challanging but it was also a 400 level class. Anyone who thinks they are going to float through this class without doing work  is wrong. He is a tough grader but a great teacher. Work hard and you will do well!!
2.5,Nice guy who seems akward in class if the class isn't actively participating. His group project was easy  but I was put with someone who didn't pull her weight and our group suffered. He said it rarely happens  but I got a B+ instead of an A because of it. He enjoys the topic but the class I had was long and boring  never let us out early.
3,He is a good guy  I think he is just misunderstood. I am unsure about the grading  I am hoping not to get low balled with an A- because it will kill my 4.0. He takes fractions of points off of things which seems unfair. It should be right or wrong  there is no way to know the exact answer he is looking for. I'm biting my nails hoping for the best!
2.5,He is completely and utterly horrible. He expects so much from the class  but does not help whatsoever  he expects his aide to help the whole time. He makes the rudest comments about people using their phones and even threatened the class about it. STAY FAR AWAY!
2.5,This class is going to be the death of me.
4.5,Best ever!!
3.5,Class was fun. Many students don't appreciate his dry sense of humor. I found him to be entertaining and a good teacher.
5,No Comments
5,Richard Davis is perhaps the most brilliant and challenging professor in this field I've ever had the honor of studying under.
5,Loved his class. Has a great sarcastic sense of humor and tells interesting stories. People are just scared to actually STUDY in college..
1.5,Im so glad he is leaving.
1.5,This professor was annoying. He talks down to students and teaches with a bias. I hated this class. i learned nothing but his views.
5,dont believe ppl who say hes 2 hard he doesn't care he drinks the blood of babies blah blah blah hes cool n stuff
5,Mr. Davis is highly recommended to those who take studying seriously and wish to excel.
4.5,"he does all these Mean things and just says ""thats the way the school want's it!"""
1,"""Dr"" Davis my hiney! He's just a Marxist raving lunatic."
5,Dr. Davis always has interesting information to share during class.
2,He might be an interesting guy and professor  who knows a lot about the subject. But definitely not the best professor for Immanuel Kant. His class makes Kant more difficult and confusing than it should be.
5,Ask for what you need and you shall receive. Need clarification? Want to know what the point is? Want diagrams of how all of Kant's philosophy fits together? You got it. Yes  Reg is famous for his tangents. But they'll be interesting  funny  and thought provoking. I highly recommend going to office hours  even if you just need someone to talk to.
4,A class on the body could be mind numbing or awesome. The downside was that a lot of things weren't discussed at all
5,Reg is a great professor who is a master at working with students on their own terms. Where he lacks in organization and simplicity in his explanations he makes up for with his ability to make spontaneous connections to what you are interested in. He has an incredibly rich understanding of any reading material because he's read much of it 50 times.
3,Really good guy who is interested in his subject. Very discussion-based  so you need to read the book.
2,The good: Funny guy  knows his stuff  fair grader  says at least one ridiculously hilarious thing per class. Bad: Can make the simplest idea incomprehensible  rambles on for hours. Someone else said it - I have no doubt he knows what he's talking about  he just doesn't have a knack for explaining things (and he goes off on confusing tangents)
3.5,Reg was an awesome teacher. So fun and funny and he really brought the material to life. He teaches in a way that you feel like you're making the connections and really learning. His class was rich and seminar orientated so students could speak plenty and ask questions (not just lecture). Great course  fun and I learned a lot.
1.5,pretty bad  in a seminar class of 7 he lecture for two hours with no break. he literally doesnt stop speaking and its supposed to be a seminar. there is no exageration here. he seems to smart to beable to convey his ideas to undergrads. he is not very articulate and makes simple ideas unmanageable.
5,Great teacher and an even better guy. Anyone who likes philosophy needs to take at least one of his classes.
1,"I'm sure HE knows what he's talking about but no one else does. And if you write papers you want to basically say what he said because no one else's view is correct to him. ""He's the expert"" - Can you tell I didn't really like the class"
1,What in the name of God was he talking about? I sat in his class for an entire semester and had no idea what he was talking about each and every day.
4,Smart man. Could be clearer  but what do you expect when attempting to explain the greater mysteries of the universe. Great teacher overall.
3.5,funny and laid back. his upper level classes are great. really knows his stuff. very confusing class  but i think that was more due to the subject matter.
1,Not good.
5,really good teacher  loves philo  dark humor
4.5,No Comments
1,prob wrote it himself
4.5,I disagree wth the previous posting. anybody that has ever attended this class knows that its amoung the more difficult courses. i know that all the students in he class ARE majors in philo. Mr. Lilly is a very interesting  colorful person. DEFINETLY HOT!
1,Simply horrible. Pedantic and narrow-minded. Dull  dull  dull. Love phil  and would've majored but for this ludicrous clown. And definitely NOT hot.
5,Great professor. Study abroad in Greece  he turned a class into a Vacation. Has a passion for the classics  and he displays that in lecture. He's also a really down to earth man  glad I took his class!
2,He is a nice enough man  he knows his stuff well. He isn't very interesting or very structured  but he does teach the class as a college course should be taught. No points given except for tests and quizzes  but he does curve  quite a bit I might say. I liked him  as a person  but never again as a prof.
3.5,I had Kumpf for both Latin and Greek. Super nice and a fair grader. He gets off topic a lot  which sometimes makes things confusing  but he's always willing to work with you  until you understand the material. S
1.5,Attending this class was akin to chinese water torture. Day after day of hearing his voice meander through the material just wore me down. Several things really got to me  such as his method of writing a name/place/date down then standing in front of it and the lack of any real structure to the class.
3.5,Very knowledgable in class  but his exams are killer. Only gives a study guide for midterm OR final  not both. Keep good notes  but also do the reading on time. Be warned  he does not do extra credit if your grade goes down after an exam. Also he has very little actual graded material  so do good on all of them or else!
5,"There is something kind of tough about his physical appearance. My friend once said  ""that guy eats glass for breakfast."" I don't think it's true  but at least it's funny. I liked his intro to Greek class. He's unbelievably patient with beginners!"
5,Great prof. Can get a little dry in lecture sometimes  but it makes his random  unexpected humor all the funnier when it comes.
5,"I'm pretty sure I took every class this man taught. He's a great professor and a very nice man. He will answer any question you think to ask. And definitely go to Greece with him  it was one of the best experiences of my life! Love  from a member of ""the animal group."""
4,Great professor. It'll take you a couple weeks before you stop finding his voice funny.
5,He tells great stories and his classes are easy. Just takes detailed notes and you'll ace the tests.
1,There was only one day the whole semester where I stayed awake the entire class time. My God he's BORING. Everything is based on the exams  no quizzes. Just a bunch of boring lectures and two exams. Go ahead and take the class if you like to be bored and actually plan on reading the text books.
5,On the one hand (men)  Greek grammer is extrememly boring  especially the Machen text  on the other hand he is a super cool guy. MMelghh. Uhhhh... okay.
5,Good teacher  seems that we learn too much out of the book and not enough out of the class  but hey its just grammer. Very helpful prof if you ask him questions.
4,Takes time to answer questions  eight am is too early though for any class. Otherwise a great teacher.
2.5,He's a very nice guy  but this is the most boring class I've ever taken. I've had a lot of trouble staying awake
5,unbelievably knowledgable  easy to talk to  i had a wonderful experience in his class. voice is funny  but he's great to talk to. i also took his trip to Greece and he was a fabulous leader for 13 students in a foreign country.
1.5,Nice man and really knows his stuff. But if you're looking to take an easy class that sounds interesting  find a different one. He's too smart to teach this gen-ed class.
4,I've never seen a teacher this smart. His teaching style may be boring and his personality weird but if you are really into physics  he's the one you can always count on.
3.5,Sometime difficult to follow  but is glad to help you outside of class. Provides copies of his notes. All homework is due at the end of the semester  and exams are take-home. Overall  Dr. Bowman is a really great guy and wants to see you learn the material.
2.5,Extremely difficult gen ed for a non science-minded person. HE is very knowledgable but gets off track easily  and his teaching style is not appropriate for a gen ed. Tests are very difficult with 6-10 multiple choice options for each question. He is a nice man - understanding and willing to help outside of class - but I would avoid this class.
2,He knows pretty much everthing about the topic  but most of the time you are just lost. He gets of topic really easy. If you like to study for hours before every test you'll be fine. If not  this is not a class for you. Has about 10 multiple choice possibilities for each question...
5,Assigns homework (15-30 questions) for each chapter  offers extra credit on exams  gives study guides  trips to the planetarium. A good professor  very smart
5,A hard class  but he's a fair guy. Read your notes. Better yet  take notes instead of talking. Laziest class I've ever been in  and I'm a comm arts major!
2,Too much busy work plus a non-fun 7 page paper. Glad to be done.
4,Use the workbook to get help on the exercises. Write down anything that he puts on the screen. You can get a B if you ask questions and stay awake.
4,Tests are hard  but he helps you get prepared for them. I feel like I'm learning. slowly. But I'm learning. Thanks Prof. Bowman.
3,The tests are very hard  but I got a C on each one of them and came out with an A in the class because he grades on effort. You just have to show him that you are willing to work. He's a super genius and should not be working for this school. His talent is being wasted  he needs to be at NASA.
2,"Even though I hate science of any sort  I was still able to admire Prof. Bowman for his intelligence and apparent concern for us. However  when I dropped his class  and saw him in the hall about 3 weeks later  my friendly smile and ""hello"" was met with his rude glare and rolling of the eyes. Admirat"

4,I personally think he is a great professor. I am kind of crazy and love physics though. I would say if you like physics  go for it  plus he has a very lenient grading scale (for 100 level classes anyway).
1,He is very boring and he teaches way over the students heads!!!
5,Dr. Burns is the best professor I've had at Texas Tech. He is very tough on you but once you graduate and you are in the real world  you will realize his class is of vital importance. His plethora of experiences (worked on Saturn V !!)  professionalism  and knowledge of IT project management are all used in today's IT world.
4,Dr. Burns has been in the Rawls since the building was erected. His class can be dry at times  but you learn what you need to for your future careers. He had a TA that graded our project grammar and we got a lot of points taken off (He averages the substance and grammar grades together). All in all  very difficult. Work hard and you will do fine.
5,Dr. Burns is definitely a person you need to learn about project management from. We went to visit some local IT companies and met with some of Dr. Burns' students. Everyone said the same things that the materials Dr. Burns taught in class were helpful and useful for their careers!
3,He is a terrific person and a good teacher  he cares for his students and does his best to help you. LOTS of homework but you have plenty of time Tests were 90 questions  the final is 120 questions. Tests are also pretty difficult with a ton of information to cover but if you study the homework you will be alright. Answer questions in class for EC
5,Dr. Burns is a nice professor. I love to hear his real life stories. Lectures are kind of interesting. Some slides are wordy but you need to read them to pass the test. We form one team during semester and deliver many reports so expect to write a lot. There are 3 homework sets and 3 closed notes  closed books exams. Overall  thump up!
3,25 homework questions from each lecture. 150 homework questions every 4 weeks. Tests are 70 questions most of which are the exact homework questions. Some questions are easy & some extremely specific. All of this while doing a semester long group project. FML. Class definitely has its pros and cons. Expect that it will take a lot of time.
1,I would avoid this professor if possible....
4,He's a good lecturer. At no time to you look at the slides on your own and feel completely lost. You have a long time to do the homework. Just do four or five questions a day. He will get into a conservative digression every now and then  but it isn't overbearing. Neither is his humor. Great class to be given a bone scorewise while also learning.
1,All test are straight from HW  but you can't view the results until the day before the test. The last homework of every set gives you less than 12 hours to complete. Basically forces all-nighters. Can't find HW answers online  in text book  or from lecture content. Expects you to remember everything from stats and know excel.
5,One of the best professors I have ever had at Tech! I like that he always share his experiences in class. I am not sure why other students said his lectures were boring. I found his lectures interesting. He shows that he cares for students' future  not just for students to get this course checked but learn nothing. His tests were tough though.
4.5,He is very kind--one of the best professors I have had so far at Tech!
1,Boring lectures  Really condescending with students  Test cover a lot of information and is hard to find even using the book If you have the option take this course with another professor.
3,Incredibly boring lectures. Homework is basically just busy work. Tests cover quite a bit of information. Given the option I would have taken this course with another teacher.
5,he's very kind.
5,Cool guy
3.5,good teach

2,While it was evident that Professor Amrine knew his subject  his lectures were dry and didn't seem to pertain to the material that was on the final. The final should have been easy  as it was a take-home essay  it really was difficult to know what he expected.
1,This was a mini-course taken for HU credit but it honestly felt like 2 hours of the Amrine show. We never had ANY discussion and he just talked for two hours straight. I don't know why I kept going. Then the one paper that the grade was based on had 0 criteria laid out. No examples or anything. I had no idea what I was doing and paid the price.
5,Phenomenal lecturer. Lectures are two hours  so it takes stamina  but if you engage yourself it is completely worth it. Lectures blew my mind every day and although the readings could be long  I usually enjoyed them. It was a minicourse  so you get out of it what you put in  and it was worth it to put in a lot.
2,Took the minicourse for intellectual breadth. It's a easy 1 credit 300 Level humanities  and I am a lazy Engineering student. He just kinda talks for 2 hours then asks you to write a paper at the end of the semester. I passed  so I can't complain
2,Professor is super caught up in his own opinions and thoughts on the material. He is incredibly knowledgeable but does not present the lectures in a way that is understandable to students unfamiliar with the topics. Final exam was released late in the semester.
4,Class was a lot of fun and incredibly interesting. I learned about things that I did not even know were things.
1,Do you enjoy wasting 2 hours of your week learning about the opinions of a self-involved professor who is unaware of his student's needs? Then this is the class for you! I have never been so bored in a class. No participation  he just talked for 2 hours. Class more about classic authors than Freud orJung. Could not recommend this minicourse less.
5,Prof. Amrine is the best professor I've ever had... extremely intelligent person  great to talk to  go to office hours! Take all of his classes. Your perspective on lifethe universeexistencephilosophywhatever it is will broaden... this is what college is all about.
5,Professor Amrine is extremely intelligent and is a wealth of knowledge and teaches Imagination with a brilliant structure. If you go into this class with an open mind  you will walk out with new perspectives to view the world from. I never post on online sites  but felt the need to convey how great of a lecturer Professor Amrine is.
4.5,TAKE THIS CLASS. You will have a better understanding of humanity. Amrine is incredibly intelligent and really helpful. His lectures are full of interesting notes on history  science  music  art  religion  etc. Lots of reading  but it's manageable and worth it.
4.5,Great professor. Very good to talk to during office hours. He speaks with a passion that is hard to find in a lot of professors. Lectures often don't relate to the books but still are very interesting to those concerned with German culture. If you have the chance take a class with this professor. it will be a good experience.
4.5,Best class I've ever taken! I loved Professor Amrine. He was always willing to help and give insight into the texts and he was brilliant in lecture. This is the kind of class that was meant to be experienced while in college. He makes you actually think  not just memorize information.
4,Really smart and really passionate about the subject  but he didn't really discuss the novels we read as much as I would've hoped. The lectures were interesting but was mildly related to the text itself. The final exam was quite fair. He is extremely helpful  especially in office hours.
3,Very intelligent professor with awesome things to say. I wish he would have focused more on the texts  which were quite difficult. Lectures were only somewhat related to the texts.
5,One of the most joyful professors I have ever had. He obviously teaches because that is what he loves doing. He never makes you feel pressured to learn  but rather just makes all sort of information available to you  and what you choose to do with it is really up to you. Highly  highly recommended!
5,Listening to Prof. Amrine is dumbfounding--he's so passionate and knowledgeable about what he teaches. Take the class! He lets your rewrite papers until you get an A and is reasonably open-minded with what you can write about. Overall  he's genius.
4.5,Absolutely fantastic professor. Extremely knowledgeable and interesting while still remaining accessible to students. Class material is conceptually difficult  but very rewarding if you immerse yourself in it. He also grades relatively generously. Overall a smart and kind man who is passionate about what he does and has a real talent for teaching.
3.5,The readings were very difficult and I found it way too easy to get lost in his discussions past the point of no return. However  he is an extraordinarily knowledgeable  charismatic  and funny man who truly cares about his students.
3,i found the lectures rather useless  while they might be interesting they are incredibly boring  and dont reeeally relate to the books. Additionally writing a 15 page paper is hard  useful knowledge but definitely more difficult than expected.
5,He's an absolute genius of a man  and that's not an exaggeration. Take a class with him and you'll see for yourself. He also personally grades all of your papers  even though the class is very large. He will always help you out if you ask him  too. If you're at all interested in the humanities  you need to take a class with Frederick Amrine.
2,He is fine. Take this course with him if you just want to pass  but not to learn to love math. Lot's of sitting in class and watching him struggle with technology BUT he is trying to get everyone to pass. All midterms are take home. You will get an A if you show up and try a little.
1,WARNING: DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Dr. Wilson's class is too all over this place. His instructions are so unclear  he makes basic algebra seem like rocket science. he is very rude to his students at times. he doesn't care if you are on your phone. if you have to take him just show up  sit in the back and bring headphones.
1,Although it was a super easy class  he made me hate the subject. He rambles on too much and his notes are all over the place. He does have a good heart and tries to get his students involved in learning  but he yells a bunch. Attendance isn't mandatory  but there is in class quizzes almost every class.
3,dr wilson is interesting.. he talks to himself a lot and his lectures are boring but if you show up its super easy. you can turn in hw whenever and all tests are take home tests! the final is super easy and you practically do it in groups.
3,Looking back at it  I loved this class! But he does get off topic and is a little confusing and eccentric. All his tests are take home and you can always go to the tutoring center for them but he has links online that will help you pass easily. He is an easy grader and really loves his students. If you get on his good side then you will love it!!
3.5,It's confusing at times  and hard to keep up. It is also hat to read to the board.
5,Wilson is such an amazing teacher! Definitely take him!! Horrible at math and got an A in his class. Easy A
3,Dr. Wilson is a great teacher who really cares about his students. Yes  he does have a very unique and unorthodox teaching style. He doesn't take attendance  all tests are take-home (yeah  take-home)  and you can re-take tests as many times as you'd like. His tests are so confusing  but go to his office hours and he'll help you understand them.
2,He is the worst teacher. I did not learn a single thing in this class. DO NOT TAKE HIM!!! Sonoma should fire him.
4.5,If you don't care about learning but want an A  TAKE THIS CLASS! He is super nice  you dont have to go to class  you can turn in late homework  and re take test as many times as you want
1,easy class and stuff can be made up  but he has to be the hardest to understand teacher i've ever had in my life. He never answers any questions clearly and constantly mumbles. NEVER USED THE BOOK
5,Super easy class. mid terms can be made up  hw can be late  can earn extra credit for practice problems. He is resourceful and nice. He is kind of old and stutters at times he even takes naps in between breaks and can put you on the spot if you talk but not in a mean way.
5,I <3 p.wilson. Extremely passionate about math and the sweetest professor I know. Easy class  can re take midterms  turn in late hw  and has tons of office hours. Take him! He's awesome! ..Too many kids goof off in class as if they were in high school still.. please be respectful and don't take advantage of him (=
4.5,The first moment I saw him I laughed. He looks somewhat homeless. However he is a great teacher. Clear  easy and the midterms and final are pretty much a breeze. Can turn in homework late and still get credit. Attendence not always necessary. Studders a lot and goes off on tangets  but it's good for zone out time. Easy GE class- I recommend him.
5,Steve is a great teacher! Very quirky  and he makes math (for those of us who don't LOVE it) a little more bearable. I work on campus and when he sees me he still says hi and remembers my name  even though it's been a few semesters. Take him if you have the chance!
2,Steve is really nice and sweet. he stutters and mumbles a lot. really easy class! take home midterms  can retake them if needed.
4,really easy and friendly teacher. students take advantage of him all the time  but there is no way you will NOT pass the class. He doesnt require you to be better but he will know who you are and your name by the second class.
3,he mumbles over every word that comes out of his mouth. teaches with his eyes closed and goes on random talks. all midterms are take home and you can retake them. goes over any homework question you ask him to in class. can turn in late hw. no one ever comes to class and there is no need to. he is a guy who means well and gets to know you. EASY!!!!
4,Easiest math class you could possibly take. He gives you the test questions and then lets you retake the tests if you dont like your score. He is really nice.
4.5,A little quirky  but generally a very sweet guy and great teacher. I'm not good at math  but he's very approachable and will answer any questions you have (over break or offce hours) Obviously very passionate about math. Take him if you have the chance :)
5,Doctor Lorden was one of the most caring teachers I have ever had. She made you work for it but she knew how to get you to really learn the material. And while it was a tough class  I can actually say I walked out knowing a lot of new things. She did allow test retakes. I miss her and if you had the blessing of being her student  you were lucky.
3.5,Dr. Lorden is sweet and she honestly just aims at giving you the absolute best learning experience she can. With that said  get ready to work because yes  you learn A LOT. Thankfully  her lectures are pretty helpful and she made the math eay to get. She often calls on you in class. She is a good teacher. Tough course. Can be slow to reply to emails
2.5,Very nice lady but not a good instructor. She has big assignments due very close together and thinks this is the only class we are taking. There is so much work to do that it's difficult to turn things in on time. Her tests are ridiculously hard  but she puts the hardest questions in the back so I start with the last question and work backwards
4,Awesome!
3.5,Her teaching style was consistent with my own personality: I prefer to be guided to my own understanding of a subject as opposed to hand-held on every concept. I suggest her if you are a student with a good deal of self-drive
2,She is amusing and sweet but the class was extremely hard. She had such a confusing way of explaining the material. I would never want to have her as my professor again.
5,She is a wonderful instructor and very concerned with the education of her students. If you take a special interest in learning the material  she will take a special interest in helping you succeed. I look forward to having her in future classes.
4,Very nice professor! Lots of papers but its a psych and lit class. Willing to help out with the papers and gives out practice with lecture topics!
4,Dr. Lorden is a great professor
4,GREAT PROF AND EXTREMELY HELPFUL. SHE IS VERY ANIMATED WHEN SHE LECTURES. yOU WILL NEED THE BOOK AND IT IS TRUYLY A WRITING INTENSIVE CLASS. SHE USES VERY FEW POWER POINTS AND TEST MATERIAL COMES FROM MANY DIFFT SOURCES. 2 MAJOR RESEARCH PROPOSALS ARE DUE THAT COUNTS AS 60% OF GRADE. BE FAMILAR WITH SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES RESEARCH METHODS
4,She is wonderfully helpful. The book is def needed  although it isnt used all the time. She incorporates many outside resources into exams. She is confusing sometimes
4,Don't get me wrong  I love Dr. Lorden to death and she's a really sweet  funny lady  but the amount of work she assigns is beyond ridiculous. Every night you have to take 1-2 quizzes  as well as around 50 pages of reading. In addition to that  there's frequent busywork assigned. The material was not that difficult though.
3.5,I don't know how she is getting all these great ratings..I got an A  but she is the most obnoxious professor I've ever had. Sweet as can be as a person  but all over the place. She is so hyper it really gets annoying after the first few classes.PSY 250  Lit review  was the biggest waste of time of my life.you have to do a million study write ups
2,She gives a lot of work and made me hate writing method sections. I changed my major after having her  but I can't blame her entirely. She is really sweet  but she gives a whole lot more work that I expected for a 200 level class. She is kind of condescending when she says things too. It gets a little annoying.
5,Great teacher. Truly willing to help. Really cares about students. Very hard class and the workload is heavy  but if you have to take this class  definitely take her.
3.5,EXTREMELY hard class. Dr. Lorden is a very nice  funny  and hyperactive professor. Her attitude helps hold your attention as the material is very dry. The workload is quite ridiculous though.
5,For starters  if you have a heavy classload do not take this class. Between her lab and lecture it was more than the other 3 classes I had combined. BUT if you don't care to do the work and want to learn she is a good one to teach you
2.5,I really like Dr. Lorden as a person...however  her class was SO hard! I agree with the fact that she really only wanted to help the people who were doing really well...There were three of us that always studied together  and I would do the worst on the tests  but she would help the other girls more than me?!...Go figure?! But  she is a fun lady!
3.5,LOTS OF WORK. prepares you well for 301  but the work is overwhelming.
5,Good prof! Explains things well. Also does a lot of inclass work to make sure you are ready for the exams. Two very long papers (all stats have them)  but she is very helpful and proof reads them - DO IT! It makes a huge difference. I enjoyed the class and learned a lot! ** Lot of work - make sure other classes are easier to allow time for it
3.5,Eric is one of my favorite people  let alone favorite professor. His class is one of the only that I participate in. You have lots of reading assignments and they're kind of hard to understand  but they're very interesting. He gets to know his students and makes everyone feel like what they say is important. I wish I could have him for every class.
4,Dr. Ruckh is that one crazy college professor that everyone hears about  but no one seems to find. You'll find that it won't be easy
4.5,Everyone has that one college professor. Dr. Ruckh is that professor. He makes you think critically  and while you will be over your head at times  you'll learn how to swim and it will be so rewarding. You can take an easy A Honors class  but if you want a challenge  are truly an academic deserving to be in the honors program  take Ruckh.
1,This class is SO MUCH READING  and Ruckh is not very clear about what he expects from you. The vagueness makes it impossible to get an A--unless he favors you  of course.
4,This class can be challenging and the lectures can be kind of hard to sit through but if you do not understand something  Dr. Ruchk and his TA's are always willing to answer questions after class and in their office hours. Dr. Ruchk wants to make you think and he teaches in a very different way. With that  you have to go to class to keep up.
3,Ruckh is not easy. But if you persevere and show interest and participate he will grow on you. I ended up ending the class with an A. A surprising A. Most interesting class i have ever took
1.5,Confusing. This is the one word that I can use to describe this professor. Ruckh talks too much about things that don't make sense. Most of what he says is irrelevant  and I find it hard to come to class everyday. He doesn't seem to appreciate your opinions if you don't agree with him. Ruckh is smart  but teaches in a confusing way...
1.5,Overall he was very keen about what he was teaching. He didn't make it easy for us to feel the same way  and at times he was slightly off-putting in regards to subject matter. There was never a clear focus and it always seemed like the weirder the better was the way to go.
3.5,Dr. Ruckh is a great teacheer and knows what he is talking about. However  The way he presents history as a flow of evergy can get very confusing. As long as you keep up with the readings  it is an enjoyable class and you can learn some valueable stuff.
2,I would not recommend this professor. He makes a history class turn into only thinking about energy flow. He makes things so hard to understand. Most of the time I had no idea what he was talking about. Be prepared to teach yourself the material. This is not a traditional history class. My worst class.
3.5,Charasmatic? Yes. Interesting? Yes. Weird/eccentric/outside-of-the-box? Most definitely. In my opinion  though  that's exactly what makes this class worth taking. Very important to keep up with reading  attending discussion sections  and also asking him questions/simply talking with him after class. Professor that truly cares.
2.5,This man is a lunatic. He managed to turn a history class into a literature course. I left his class with less knowledge about the world post-1500s than when I went into it. He does care about his students. However  he has one teaching style and that is it. So if you are not on the same wavelength as him  prepare to be left in the dark.
4.5,Okay  this is hard. Reading-Jung-and-Freud-in-the first-week-hard. You read a book (or more!) a week. You go into hardcore hermeneutics and philosophy. You analyze stories until they are just a bone of word-framework. But I got so much out of this class  and now I look at every story in a different way. Still  this class is not for the weak.
5,"This guy is definitely worth taking.------Pros: 1) you gain an overall understanding of anything he covers. 2) he explores new ideas with the class. 3) most open-minded person I have ever met.------Cons: 1) you read a LOT of books that I would not consider ""easy reads"" 2) you write a LOT (in the fresman seminar).------ 20% participation. so talk."
4.5,not the history class i was expecting  but that was a good thing. i LOVE eric ruckh! he is the most interesting teacher i have ever had and it was a nice change of pace compared to being in the science building all day. i worked hard and got a B  but it was worth it because you will never have a class like this.
4,he makes the class way harder than it has to be....if u think u are going to learn history you are dead wrong. this might as well be call philosophical history than history. a lot of reading....but on the plus we does clarify very well  helps you out anytime and keeps you moderately interested.
4.5,I loved taking this class. He takes a different approach to teaching history  and further wants you to understand it instead of just reading out of a book. He's very helpful  all you have to do is ask  and cares about his students. I'd love to take another class with him.
2,This class was 10% history  50% intellectual thought  and 40% philosophy. There is a reason his classes never fill up and 50% of the class drops on week two. You would think your in a PhD program and not HIST 111. Any other teacher is an easy A with effort. You will not get an A in this class.
4.5,I loved my honors seminar class with him-- the material we read was very interesting. We had to read a lot and were writing papers every week. It's a lot of work  but the knowledge you gain is incredible. Really makes you think. Of course  sometimes he'll tell you a bit TMI  but he really tries to connect with his class. You read long novels.
4.5,Eric is a true intellect. His classes show that history contains an interpretive aspect. He is unique and enjoyable. Do the work  be prepared to engage in conversation  and listen. All opinions and comments drive the conversation in different directions but Dr. Ruckh has a way making all comments relevant. I recommend his courses to everyone I know
5,He is by far the best teacher that I have had at SIUE. He is extremely helpful and very talented. I didn't know he was retired? I guess he came back to teach my class  but I'm so glad he did! If you ever have the opportunity to take his class  do it!
1,No Comments
5,AMAZING TEACHER! Probably my favorite! He is so good at music and philosophy  and man he is HOT.
4,No Comments
5,I am honored to have been in his class. I wish him luck in his retirement  but I wish he wouldn't leave! He has so much knowledge to share.Very talented musician!

5,He is such an awesome teacher. I am so glad he came back to teach this class. He really knows his stuff!
4.5,He's retired but he came back to teach this semester. I think he's a great guy  great teacher  awesome musician.

5,"Mr Verdi's opening questions were always brilliant - case in point - his opening question for the Illiad: ""Why are these men fighting?"" Along with Gisela Berns the best tutor in St. Johns. My only regrets at St. Johns: not choosing his Wittgenstein preceptorial and missing the chance to enroll in his Nietzsche Preceptorial. Ah.. St. Johns---!!!!!"
5,"The Dostoevsky preceptorial in ""The Bell Tower"" with Mr. Verdi ranks as the best class I have taken. His opening questions brilliantly demonstrated the effectiveness of the art of asking questions  and how it is an indispensable preliminary for a close-reading of texts  especially Dostoevsky's incomparable novel ""The Brothers Karamazov""."
4,I think the previous rater hit it: one of the few tutors who could express himself clearly  and who also tried to understand students w/o judging and putting them down.
5,He's talented at not only explaining what he means clearly  but also at understanding what student are actually saying. I had him for my senior essay advisor  and he was extremely helpful. He focuses on getting as much as possible out of any conversation without making you feel inadequate while still encouraging you to learn and challenging you.
4.5,No Comments
5,an invigorating tutor  and all the girls follow him around like he is a peice of candy
5,Great tutor. Works well with students!
5,"John V is ""The Dude"" ... brilliant and brilliant at being a St. John's Tutor... I learned TONS in that preceptorial"
5,LOVE THE FISH SHIRTS.
5,Never had him for tutorial  but he is one of the best guys with whom to strike up a conversation. If Nietzsche entices you  Verdi is your man.
5,Yeay! Best sarcasm EVER. Ask him to do the face thing.

4.5,Cool guy. Very practical approach to the material. The first test made me think this class would be really difficult  but by the third exam I had gotten the hang of the testing level and grading style.
5,Awesome teacher. Definately knows what he is talking about and has some interesting stories to tell.
5,very fun teacher. while teaching the math  he relates the stuff to interesting subjects. he is very intellegent  and almost seems overqualified. very easy to work with
3.5,Very nice guy and really cared about his students. He has some really great stories.
4.5,Awesome teacher.
3,"Very confusing at times. I would have no idea what he was talking about. He likes to jump around a lot. Tends to ""forget"" things a lot. Stuff like ""oh yeah you need to know this to do this problem but i forgot to teach it to you."" Is a very interesting person though and has some funny stories."
5,No Comments
4,Definitely insane... he could work on connecting his ideas so that his lectures are more cohesive.
4,Very nice. Insane. My favorite Professor. The bestof the Calculus Professors.
4.5,He's a great teacher with a dad type sense of humor even though he's pretty young. His teaching skips around a bit during lecture but he makes it interesting enough that you can pretty much keep up. If you get lost he's quick to guide you back on track. Attendance is a biggie with him and could be the difference of an B or A in his class.
4,If you pay attention in class you will do good on the tests. He takes his essays from the review he gives you and choses a select number for test. He teached from the book  which helps with not taking as many notes. Be prepared to work on the review sheets though because they are the outline for the test. Good Professor overall.
2.5,He is young and has a great personality. The thing I didn't like is he reads a lot of his personal notes and they skip around from 20 years within eachother. But overall he is a good teacher just a little unorganized.
5,"I love him as a professor. He has a great sense of humor if you can take kinda ""groan"" laughs or very pop-culture types of jokes. He gives the lesson  and go every day and you'll do fine. If you slack off and don't pay attention you'll mess yourself up. So just pay attention and you'll be gold. Really nice guy. Tall  though."
3,Decent. Just reads directly out of the book and gets very mundane.
4,He is very nice and funny.
4,Overall he is alright. Relaxed cool!
5,His assignments were all discussion posts  which don't have many parameters. He assigns a book that is a great read  it hardly feels like work. If you do the work then you will get the grade. Be sure to request for your article that is due at the end of the class. You will know what I am talking about  but be sure to request for them in advance.
5,TAKE HIM IF POSSIBLE!!! I loved his class and learned so much. Only 5 grades though  all 4 exams and 1 paper  so study!! But material was explained throughly and in a way youll remember!
5,He is very smart and has a great teaching style. He teaches about interesting things that you would want to learn about! He is awesome!
5,He is amazing! He knows what he is talking about and is so funny that you want to pay attention and learn.
5,Take Dr. Hupp. He's one of the best teachers at SIUE. You can tell that he's passionate about teaching. He's very helpful.
4.5,Dr. Hupp is one of my favorite professors ever! His lectures are fun yet informative. You'll never be bored in class  but you'll still learn a lot. The funny stories he tells about his kids really help with the material sometimes. If you show up and pay attention  you should do just fine in his child psych course.
5,I love Hupp as a professor! This is my second time taking him and i have zero complaints. The field study was super easy. Only 1 easy test  and paper that is really your reference letter for him to write. Take him for any class he offers  great professor!
4.5,Dr. Hupp is amazing! He cracks jokes in every lecture that are actually funny  his grading criteria for the paper is literally step-by-step  and I actually learned a lot in his class because his lectures are so engaging! Great choice for child psych!
2,Funny but not realistic
5,This class was one of my favorites and Dr. Hupp has been one of my favorite professors. As long as you attend class  take good notes and study for the tests you will get an A. Should definitely take Dr. Hupp  he is a fantastic professor and is really funny
5,I always looked forward to this class! Professor Hupp is hilarious and always keeps things interesting. Taking organized notes and attending class will make this class a breeze! Recommended to anyone interested in Psychology.
4.5,A good professor  super easy and nice  I would recommend him for child psych  attendance is not mandatory but if you miss he does not put the slides on blackboard so it is recommended you go  plus you'll find yourself wanted to go to class
5,By far the best professor I have ever had! He made the class so much fun and interesting! The tests are pretty easy. All you need is to read the book and study the notes and you will do really well.
5,FAVORITE PROFESSOR! SOOOO FUNNY! I would never miss a day because he makes class so interesting. TAKE HIM!!!
4,Hupp is an AMAZING teacher. He is very interactive and loves what he does. His power points are very easy to understand as long as you attend class when he goes over them. Test are easy and over what he has talked about. attendance is not mandatory but he doesnt put the power points on blackboard.
5,What an awesome class!Prof Hupp is one of the best teachers I've ever had! Made lectures fun and interesting  even with some boring materials. The exams aren't too hard either. Multiple choice questions and some gimmies :) Great professor makes this a great class! Definately worth taking!! (even if psyc isn't your major) THE BESTTT!! :)
5,Wow  was he amazing... he taught a whole class blind-folded  just for humor. I'd also like to marry this man. So hands off.
5,"Dr. Hupp is amazing! He made lectures actually enjoyable and people were fighting for the front row! I learned alot without hearing ""Beuller? Is anyone out there."" Thanks Hupp!!!"
4,"Dr. Hupp was GREAT!!! He made the lectures fun and really interesting. Gives great examples in the notes. If you come to class and pay attention you will do fine. Exams usually have a few ""gimmes""-easy points. I would definitely recommend his class!!!"
5,Dr. Hupp is one of the funniest professors at SIUE. He makes class fun and you learn a LOT!
5,Changed a lot of the ways I view things. I have a learning disability and still managed to be captivated by the crispness of the information. Cold on the outside  but will engage with you with disarmingly genuine honesty when it is warranted. Tough  but fair. A force of positivity in this world.
4,Whip-smart and clearly an expert in her field (19th century British lit.). Doesn't take any bull. Highly respected at McGill. Go to her office hours.
3,Professor Sparks is a ball of joy. She is an excellent lecturer who is extremely knowledgeable of her mainstream field of expertise (Victorian Novels/ 19th Century Novels). The lectures are quite heavy  yet super interesting. Be ready to read a lot though (6 novels of about 300-400 pages each 1 every 2 weeks). Good feedback. Demanding conferences
3,Tabitha is stict and pretty dense on the material. She obviously knows what she's talking about but she moves really fast though her lectures  leaving the class scrambling to jot everything down. Her quote ID's are obscure and difficult to succeed in without memorizing the whole text. But she is a fair marker in other regards.
3.5,Her lectures are thorough but dry  and copious notes are required to retain the relatively unimportant details that seem to pop up on the midterm/final. Might be a better prof for a course that interests her more  but I wouldn't recommend taking Departmental 2 with her if it can be avoided.
4.5,Professor Sparks is an absolute delight  and her classes are highly informative  intellectually stimulating  and fun!She has a sophisticated veneer  but is actually incredibly warm (more so than most other professors) when you go to see her in office hours  and really validates participation in class.Tough but fair marker.RECOMMENDED!
1.5,okay so this was one of the most boring classes i have ever had. She has this monotonous voice that drains the life out of you. she simply reads off her notes and looks up once in a while. yes her exams are hard  but that's not the problem. it's the unstimulating lectures that kills the fun out of english class. dreadful class. AVOID.
3.5,Last night I dreamt I went to Sparkyville again. I know that I could never go back  but I would like to. Professor Sparks is one of the most effective instructors in the department. Her lectures made me feel like Oliver Twist  for I truly wanted more. Take her class  you'll learn quite a lot  and you will enjoy it!
4.5,Lady Sparky is a remarkable professor.r Her lectures were incredibly lively and informative. Tabby is a brilliant academic whose body of knowledge is quite impressive. Be sure to participate and arrive on time. This is the minium respect you can pay to a lovely lady who has the stunning beauty of Lady Audley and the sharp wit of Sherlock Holmes.
3.5,A good lecturer  and a fair marker.
3,Her lectures are excellent  among the best I've ever attended as they are very clear. However  she is something of a brutal marker  and her final exam requires coverage of large amounts of course material in a very limited space. She is also rather cold in person  as if she has no time for you. This discourages you from asking for help.
2.5,she thinks very highly of herself  isn't very approachable and an extremely hard marker. she also very obviously picks favorites. would not recommend this class unless you have a strange obsession with 19th century lit.
4.5,Never though I'd be interested in a Victorian Novel class but thanks to her interesting reading list choices and informative lectures I warmed up to the subject pretty quickly. Not an easy  but rather a just marker. Do yourself a favor and come to class  then you practically don't have to study for tests.
5,This woman is not only a brilliant academic  but a wonderful teacher. This is all too rare in this dept  and I highly recommend taking advantage of her dry wit  insightful commentary  and wonderful lectures. All that  and she's ridiculously sweet and helpful  even with matters outside the course material.
4,At first  I thought she was interesting and painfully intelligent. Then I saw the final essay topic (8 of 11 dry  dense theorists into one 10 pg paper) and was no longer a fan. Once I wrote the paper  I realized the point behind the class and the exercise and loved her again. It's not easy  she makes you work and think  but Sparks is a great prof!
4.5,Marvellous professor. Drily witty  extremly insightful  and a stimulating lecturer. I suspect that anyone who doesn't like her really isn't cut out for literary theory anyway.
3,One of the most intelligent women I have ever met. (however  we've never really met) She just lectures to me...and I listen.
4.5,Whatever--she is totally fair. I got an A in one of her classes and an A- in the other. One time  the TA gave me a 78 and she raised it to an 80 before I even saw the paper. She can be dry but she has a great sense of humour--and let's face it  she's brilliant.
3,Really smart  but horribly dense subject matter makes classes boring and exceedingly difficult. Incredibly hard marker as well... don't expect over a B
4.5,Excellent choice of subject matter and good lectures. Very  very nice professor. Some were afraid this theory course would be dry but Sparks managed to make it meaty and interesting.
4,I took her class for the SYRCE Art History class. Her class is very easy and she makes Art History kinda interesting. She is very clear on what she wants from the class and is helpful with questions. Attendance does count for quite a bit  but missing a class here and there won't kill you. I would recommend taking this class! No textbook required.
4,Shaw is really tough and you definitely have to study hard and do the reading. However  she's one of my favorite art history teachers because she's SO passionate and because she cares about quality. She's really willing to put in the time to help you succeed  so long as you do the same. Not a lot of tests
2,She is very unorganized! She also tends to make inappropriate comments about the art discussed. She does assign weekly readings and papers.
2.5,Are you an art major? If you are not  I would avoid this class. The professor gives a lot of reading for just a GE. The texts themselves were written by artists for artists  and are extremely confusing and inaccessible. The quizes are very long as well. This class actually has made me hate modern art  and I am becoming a less well-rounded person.
4,Cool teacher! Very funny at times and I enjoyed coming to class. However  when it comes to grading she is a beast. If you want to pass this class  I have three words for you: study  study  study.
5,She was an amazing teacher really funny and nice. Extremely helpful  fantastic class I loved it! Used the book for terms and just when we had to compare paintings. Midterm and final easy of you study for it  recommend flashcards.
5,BEST CLASS EVER! Tests are easy if you study your ass off  but it's worth it. Be prepared to start studying a week before the midterm and final. Other than that Shaw makes this class fun  interesting  and worthwhile. Attendance is necessary  but class is so interesting that you will want to be there.
4.5,She is a great teacher  but if you don't know art well  don't take the class. It's hard. But it did like it. Midterm  2 papers  and final or a paper. You pick one.
4,I was not interested in art at all coming into class but now i LOVE it! She makes everything so interesting and has a sense of humor while teaching it. SHes really nice but you HAVE to come to class and participate. dont buy the textbook! amazing class i recommend taking it but be ready to write essays for the exams!
2.5,Prof. Shaw was average in most areas. However  she wouldn't respond to my e-mails  and she doesn't seem particularly enthused about helping a brotha out. It is unlikely that she will make much of an impression on you  either positive or negative.
4.5,Jennifer was a great teacher  she relies a lot on her TA but none the less is very clear and interesting. You don't need to buy the books just go to class and almost everything on exams is right out of class.
4.5,Shaw is an easy professor as long as you go to class. Do NOT buy the textbook  I never opened it. she tells you everything you need to know in class.
2.5,A good teacher  very good at what she does  but pretty ****y and often misses class or things come up in personal life.
4,I am not an Art History major but I found this class to be very interesting. There is a lot of memorization required which can be time consuming. I don't think she was that hard with grading  especially if you take notes and study them before the exams since all of the questions come straight from the lecture.
1,Very interesting class  she puts it all in an understandable historical context. The art and the context takes precedence over memorizing artist/title/date. Lots of reading.
4.5,Great teacher. Her lectures can be long but she is very clear about the subject. you dont have to buy the book  she explains all the concepts that you are expected to know in class. She made the class quite interesting. Recommended.
4.5,She is a great teacher and you will learn a lot from her. Class work is very time consuming though so don't take an upper division class from her if you are not going to have a lot of time to put into the class. Make sure to do the weekly assignments because they make a difference in your final grade. Is always will to help you and go over things.
3,Shaw only receives good ratings because mostly everyone taking her are ARTH majors themselves  with a real passion for the subject-- quality of professor be damned. As someone who is not an ARTH major  I can assuredly tell you that she's impossible. She's an unreasonable grader with the essays and midterm. I wouldn't take her unless you have to.
4,Very fair grading. You never have to read  just show up to class.
4,Great class  great professor. Her lectures are interesting and not too much work is required in the class  just study for test.
2,Exams are open-notes and open-internet. Projects are relatively straightforward  but small mistakes will lose majority credit - however resubmissions are allowed. If you want a chance at an A  you need to go to him with well thoughout questions so you dont need to resubmit. Use his example code as the starting point for all projects.
2,Cares about his students  but the projects are disgusting. 4 projects  as said elsewhere 100% 67% or 0%. Even with resubmissions  the criteria for design points are 100% subjective  not written anywhere  and missing any means a loss of 33% of a project grade. Lectures were okay but finished early almost every day. Tests weren't bad.
1,Definitely avoid at all costs. I had heard all the terrible things about him and wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt  but it's all true. You won't pass if you don't give him PRECISELY what he wants to see.
4,Okay  so the trick with Kaminsky is you go to him every chance you get to check your projects. If you follow the examples you're given and he approves of it you're basically golden  otherwise  you're in trouble. Probably gave me the most anxeity of any professor I've ever had though.
1,Do not take this man if you have the chance. Avoid at all costs. If you get stuck with him be prepared to lose a third of your project grades based on his opinion of your design. Design it exactly as he has written it or you get no credit no matter how functional. Says he is available outside of class. However  he is mostly unhelpful and curt.
1,He is a terrible professor  and his grading system make almost every students in his class to get F. You will never get 100 from his project  he will take off 33% of your grade by saying you do not meet Design requirement(which he make it on his own term). Crazy professor. STAY AWAY !
1,There are only 4 projects  which you will get either get 100%  66%  or 0%  and 3 tests that are almost impossible to pass. HORRIBLE PROFESSOR
2,4 Projects. Miss a single criteria out of a list of 6-10? Max possible grade 66%. Test cases often all fail together  for reasons that are either very close to being  or are entirely arbitrary (showing a player piece on a board before they join) 4 projects  which you will often either get 100%  66%  or 0%  and 3 tests are all that is graded/
1,Very melancholic  10/30 points on projects is either pass or fail. So either 10 or 0. He will never admit he is wrong. I got an F on a project because he stopped testing when it failed a test case that WORKED! I went to see him and he would not admit that he was wrong even though I showed him Java Documentation showing he was wrong.
2.5,He says that he's available to talk about assignments and loves to see what students have come up with  but every time I talked to him he just grimaced and gave one-word answers. Not helpful in the slightest. Also  expect to lose credit on fully functional programs because they don't meet specific criteria that he doesn't share with the class.
4.5,VERY tough grader. Your work has to be perfect in order to receive credit. However  the assignment very  very clearly defines its requirements  and you even get a chance to correct and resubmit your projects after the grades are released. Exams are open-notes  -book  and -Internet. Follow his instructions exactly and you'll do fine.
4,My advice  meticulously read every letter of his assignment twice to make sure you don't miss anything. He'll give you a zero if you do. Otherwise  very knowledgeable and interesting. Has a dry humor and can be pretty stoic. He scares me sometimes. Would still take again though.
1,Gives you a zero on your project if you are missing a newline or have entered an extra newline  even if the project is 99% functional. Is unwilling to help you  even if you meet him in person. I met him in person and asked what I could do differently  so he asked me what I could do differently. Wtf.
3.5,2 tests  4 programming projects  and 1 Final. TestsFinal are open-noteslaptop. Directions are 100% clear. Projects are essentially passfail  with some credit for code design. Put in the work and its an easy A  dont and you wont do well. Awkward professor  but knows cryptography very well. Would recommend as long as you are willing to work hard.
3,Projects are basically passfail. You either do everything right and get an A or do one thing wrong and lose at least 13 of the grade (more if it affected your output). Tests are open note but  again  you better make sure everything is right or points are going out the window. Lectures are pretty basic but informative. Good luck...
2.5,Expect to lose points for the most trivial things. Extra output  incorrectly formatted output
2.5,Expect to lose points for the most trivial things. Extra output  incorrectly formatted output
3.5,Good professor. Explanations are clear. He's very methodic and strict. There are a lot of programming projects and the grading is though (got an F on a project because of a debug statement I left on the code). Tests are long  hard but are basically about what's mentioned in class. Lecture notes suck  so don't miss the lectures.
4.5,Actually really good. Course policies are incredibly clear. Strict (a good thing  in my opinion) but fair. Homeworks are challenging but rewarding. There is never any ambiguity here  which is a good thing.
3.5,Do not expect to coast through his class. Do not expect him to give you answers. Go to him with problems and he will lead you to solutions. He wont give you the solution  he will lead you to it and leave you to figure out how to drink. If you want to learn you will learn a lot from him.
1,He's the worst professor I have ever had. I learned nothing of substance  he nitpicks on quite literally every single possible thing you can nitpick on  and his grading scheme is there to the detriment of students. I read these reviews while picking classes last semester but didn't think it was going to be _this_ bad.
1,Not a great professor for so many reasons. He teaches pretty clearly and seems like a nice guy  until it comes to academics... His grading is tough  and almost no one feels prepared for his tests. Worst thing by far: he calculates your grade 3 different ways  and TAKES THE LOWEST. Why? Does he want people to fail?
5,Professor taught us well. Hr was very fluent and nice.
1,Gentle Advice. Just Don't take any online course under him. He just uploads the slides and expect from you to learn by yourself. Never clear your doubts. You will not learn anything from his course. Worst Professor.
1,Not a good professor for the course.
1,This guy is useless and arrogant. He converted a regular class into a blended one and kept assigning research papers for students to read  while he himself sits at home. He is never in his office. Most hilarious is that if you ask him something he doesn't know  he will tell you a long story about the work he did at Morgan Stanley 20 yrs ago.
3,Took for PLC  do not recommend. Lectures are meaningless  tests are brutally specific. Projects are simple but very poorly explained both because instructions are unclear and because he doesn't teach the material required. Prepare to spend a lot of time in his office or exchanging emails  which he can take a day to respond back to.
2.5,Do not take him if you want to learn something. I got nothing out of his lectures. Was a waste of my money and time
3.5,Goes off on long tangents/unrelated anecdotes. Clearly knows the material  but seems to sometimes have a hard time actually explaining the concepts. Tests are brutal. Absolutely brutal. Projects/labs are a good grade buffer  though. Overall would recommend him if you want to learn  but not if you want an A.
1,Seriously  don't take him if you really want to learn something in database. His grading is mostly related to how many times you meet him in his office outside the class. Doesn't discuss any coding at all  doesn't even look at your codes for the project. Teaches from PPT slides only. You'll learn more from books and Google than anything from him.
1.5,Unhelpful analogies  tangents  skimming over slides  no coding exercises before tests or project  heavy on the theory  low on the syntax but tests are all SQL/XML/relational algebra syntax  surprise graded activities  mandatory graded surveys  tested on project material  you are expected to write project in 3 weeks. Grade is Tests: 50% Project: 40%
4.5,Got to learn a lot  he guides you through the course and we get to do major part.
4,Very helpful and understanding  medium skill set but ready to experiment with new trends in CS.
1,"Folks  If you value your money never take him. I was surprised at his lack of knowledge and in defense he said ""This is a grad course  you dont expect me to know everything""  duh?"
4,Professor Raj is an all around good professor. He is clear and you will understand the material. His tests are not easy but they are not overly difficult if you pay attention. I would recommend him for DBC.
3.5,He's pretty easy  and if you already know what you're doing  I highly recommend him. He's got the clearest accent of any of the Indian professors except maybe Teredesai. If you're shaky on material though  avoid. You won't learn enough from him.
2,Simply horrible. If you DON'T WANT TO LEARN A WORD  TAKE HIM.
4,He is tough... but if you want to learn his the way to go. He is very helpful outside of the classroom also. One of two best professors I've had at RIT.
4,he really IS a walking encyclopedia...he knows so d*mn much about programming and design patterns and of course his compiler stuff. His grading can give you a heart attack  expect the worst  or expect the not-expected  and prepare to be surprised when you do check your grade in the end..! His material is hardcore  be serious and do the work
5,Tough professor  asks a lot of you. He really cares how you do in his courses. Willing to help out a struggling student.
5,One of thee best teachers. If you are a slacker ha! You are ****ed! You will be taking the class agian. Take the time to humble yourself  and go to his office hours if you need to. He is one smart teacher.
5,the best faculty I ever came across.
5,Excellent professor. He's a walking encyclopedia!
3.5,Karen is nice. She gives a reading quiz but then goes over what you just read the next class so it can be boring. Do the homework  memorize a bunch of stuff  and you'll be hard pressed to get less than a B.
4.5,Karen is nice  and I liked this class subject I guess  but be prepared to read out of Mike Cullinane's book before every class. Each class starts with a reading quiz  and each week you have a HUGE homework due. Tests are exactly like the study guides. Go to her office hours before exams  she'll use problems right from the exam to help teach you.
4.5,Great professor  always has a smile and is willing to help! She does a really good job at breaking up material to make it easier to understand  but it's easy to fall behind if you miss class. Do the practice problems from the study sheet before the exam.
5,Best math teacher i have ever had...very clear on every topic is willing to sit with you and help you out...i would def take her again...
5,She is a wonderful teacher. Very easy to talk to and ask for her help. Always smileying in class.
5,Really enthusiastic  wicked friggen nice  and a good teacher. Her tests can get pretty husky but thats to be expected in Linear Algebra.
5,I despise math with a passion  but this professor made it livable and really not so bad. Really willing to help and very good at making you understand what's going on. If you really try then your grade won't be horrible. If you need a gen ed take this professor.
2,she is a very nice lady and i understood her notes ... her quizes were easy but her tests left many people in the class with ots of questions ... i felt the tests were too hard and might bring down someones grade a lot.
5,VERY nice. Extremely helpful and thorough whether you're good in math or not. Self-paced course (with limits)  so you can really grasp material before moving onto next topic. Great course for anyone to take. An extremely patient and kind prof. that is willing to help at anytime.
5,Excellent teacher.
5,Probably one of the nicest teachers I've ever met. VERY helpful and explains material very clearly. I never did well in math  but got an A in her class because she was so thorough in her explanations
5,karen is such a great role model for the ladies in the math department...she is smart  confident  and so into what she teaches. she is always available for help  she explains topics very well  and is always around to talk if you are having a bad day.
5,No Comments
4.5,Karen is very generous and definitely makes learning easy. She is always available for help outside of class too
4,Karen is an awesome professor  very peppy and into what she is teaching!
4,Teacher is wonderful!!! Very enthusiastic about Dance.
5,Energetic  Wonderful  Passionate  good projects  straight forward on test requirements
4.5,Boyd is a very sweet lady and makes learning interesting. I thought dance appreciation was going to be so boring but it's not with her.
5,Emily is one of the most energetic and outgoing professors I ever had  there never was a day I didn't want to not come to class I loved every minute of it  she truly is a blessing and a gifted teacher
5,emily is awesome  she is such a sweetie. Definitely an understanding teacher especially compared to the evil witches darby and tiffanee! if you want to have fun then take emily
5,Emily is the best Jazz instructor I've had so far. She has helped me a lot while studing my leg problem & by helping me do in class drills. She is so sweet  loving  caring  & full of excitement. U Rock my world! Stay Sweet!!:)
1.5,This is by far the worst teacher I have ever had. In a philosophy class  he discusses environmental issues. It is also a how-to for moodle. Never seen a teacher go so crazy with that website.
1,Terrible teacher. Was forced to take the class due to FIG. He had hundreds of hours worth of homework that had nothing to do with the class. Asked for help and support several times  and he was helpless. Avoid at all costs.
1,Horrible teacher  not helpful  and completely rude. But I believe he has reasons behind his methods giving loads of busy work. I learned how to work diligently and get things done on time. I still hate him though.
1,terrible.
1,The worst teacher on this campus  all of his assignments are unnecessary and do not relate to anything we talk about during class. He likes to hear himself talk and he loves moodle but moodle is awful. he is an awful teacher  avoid him at all costs. you will not learn anything. he doesn't speak very good english and has a thick accent. hate class
1,Have fun on moodle.
1.5,He is not as bad as they make it seem. He has a very thick accent and sometimes it is hard to understand. He gives about ten homework assignments before class but he never gives quizzes or tests. Homework is easy and it all takes about an hour to do. 2 small presentations and one final big group presentation. I would recommend this class.
1.5,Zeno is a very redundant teacher. Avoid if at all possible. He gives a ton of pointless work that is hard to keep up with  and doesn't really teach anything related to philosophy. Total waste of my time.
1,Horrible teacher  pointless class  did a 20 page paper on my emotions.... Literally the worst teachers i have ever had.
1.5,Had him for Critical thinking and he is the least understanding individual on the planet. He fails utterly at the critical thinking aspect of his course. If you weren't agreeing with him he didn't like you. Also a ridiculous amount of online work. Stay away
1,This teacher is honestly the worst teacher I have ever had. In Philosophy  you are allowed to have an opinion  but not in his class. This class is full of work that has nothing to do with Philosophy. It has hurt me in other classes because I spend so much time on his homework that is busy work. I pretty sure I got an A in his class. :(
1,This man is not an educator. His concern with his students and work ethic reflect a close minded individual. Awful time and worst way to start a year at college. If you take this class then you might as well drop it and try to get someone else.
1,ABSOLUTE WORST TEACHER AT SONOMA STATE!!!! DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH HIM UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR SEMESTER RUINED!!!!!
1.5,Worst professor I could have ever imagined having. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS.
1,Very hypocritical. Teaches a class that should teach open mindedness but yet he is the most close minded person I have met. In his class there are two types of OPINIONS  his and the wrong ones. I would say the class is 90% online yet he is incompetent at helping/working with Moodle (the class' website) himself. If you get him good luck.
1,Ridiculous amount of work assigned. At the time  work assigned had nothing to do with Philosophy. Looking back I can see how he tried to connect it  but failed. Tries to be a good teacher  but he just doesn't explain things well. I suggest you don't take this class.
1,WORST TEACHER OF MY LIFE. DO NOT TAKE HIM. This class had nothing to do with philosophy and there is so much work it is ridiculous. You will be saving yourself so much stress if you do not take him.
1,Class is a lot of work that really has nothing to do with philosophy. Work itself is pretty easy. I managed to get an A. You just have to do the work. You will get frustrated easily though. You will have to buy like 5 books and use them all a lot  and keep a journal. One personal presentation and a couple of group presentations.
2,The amount of work he gives is ridiculous. I was doing way more homework then my other friends who had a different phil 101 teacher. However I managed to get all of my work done and ended up with an A. The work isn't difficult it is just very very time consuming.I also learned nothing about creative thinking. Choose a different professor!
1,WORST TEACHER I HAVE EVER TAKEN! I tell all my friends NOT to take him. He literally has made me burst into tears because I worked my butt off and got a bad grade- 45% on a twelve page OPINION paper. I cannot stress how much I despise this man!
4,Very good professor overall  knows the subject well and is accessible outside class . Attendance recommended. Better start working on Coursework early
4,He knows the material
5,Lectures were always helpful and engaging  assignments were all well designed and helped me learn the material. Great guy.
5,Professor White delivers the best lectures in the Computer Science department at RIT. He makes it very clear that he will not waste his students' time and teaches until the figurative bell rings. His lectures are always clear and follow a logical progression as the semester goes on.
5,PHIL NYE THE CONCEPTS GUY (PHIL PHIL PHIL PHIL...)
1,He doesn't know how to teach  and on midterms  he asked questions that he did not cover/lecture. AWFUL professor
4,This is my second class with Professor White. His tests are tough and he usually doesn't budge on partial credit. The homeworks and project are totally doable  just start on time. Overall  I really enjoy Phil and the way he teaches. I really feel like I learned a lot  regardless of grade.
4,Phil will refer to the textbook but his syllabus doesn't outline what sections of the chapter to read  so the textbook isn't a good tool to use for the class. The labs and projects are doable if you start them early. His exams are tough.
5,Phil White is honestly the best CS professor I've had at RIT. His style of teaching is excellent and really helps you get a thorough understanding of the material. He is a very fair grader and is clear with his expectations. He is often blatantly sarcastic and has a good sense of humor. Overall a fantastic professor!
5,Best class I've ever failed
1,He is really awful professor  and he does not seem like helping student during office hours.
3.5,Phil's tests are tough but if you work on the labs and projects you can make up for less than stellar test grades. He's a fun lecturer but does digress from the topic sometimes. Overall  I enjoyed his class.
1,Awful professor  his tests are RIDICULOUSLY difficult  and he doesn't give any hints about the exams. AVOID him ! or you will get D or F.
4,Lectures are energetic and interesting  covering many topics each lecture without repeating himself a ton. Happy to answer questions during the class. Overall a great professor  would take him for every class if I could.
1.5,I like him for the first few weeks Then  everything went downhill. He likes to digress a LOT. He NEVER gives hints about what are on the test  and he suggested to read up Carither slides EVEN though nothing similar on his TEST. If you want to understand and get good grade  AVOID HIM. HARRDDD GRADER ! ! !
4.5,Very tough class  very amazing professor. His exams are difficult and often contain vague information that he only mentioned briefly in class. If you get any aspect of the problem wrong  don't expect partial credit. He's super clear in lectures  but you have to work really hard for a good grade.
4.5,I had professor White for Comp Sci for AP Students. No textbook that I remember  labs are weekly but not overly difficult if you've had coding experience before. If you pay attention in class he will often describe how to do anything tricky in the lab and he's always willing to help if you ask.
4.5,Insanely good lecturer. Interesting to listen to  fun and extremely fair. Really cool guy overall
4.5,Very passionate about computer science! He gets really excited when talking about certain topics. He keeps the mood up with lots of geeky computer jokes. Labs and projects are challenging but not too difficult if you pay attention. If you like computer science you will enjoy the class. He doesn't require a textbook  either.
4.5,If you come to class you'll be fine. Spent a lot of time covering certain topics and then rushed through others. Very helpful if you go to his office hours  but beware  he may sit and talk to you for hours if nobody else is waiting. Knows a lot about his topic and overall is a very good professor.
1,bad news
1,:( :(
5,She is a very kind and caring teacher who is willing to give extraa time to help her students.
4.5,Very good teacher!! If you study and do your work  she will love you and you will get an A. She is a very lenient grader  and has no problem helping you. Take her!!
3,She is a good teacher who cares about all of her students.
1,Quite possibly one of the WORST at EKU. She shows favoritism  biasness  and her personal opinion is easily swayed in either direction by gossip and the opinion du jour. She cares little for her classes and her students. I've worked with her ESL students and watched their scores FALL as a result of her program. DO NOT TAKE ANY OF HER CLASSES!!
2,Dr. Allameh rambles on wild tangents. If you like that kind of thing  she's great. You can earn an A if you do all the work and if she likes you. Take an interest in what she talks about. Ask her for extra resources.
2,She was very hard on grading papers  she showed favoritism  and she was never any fun!!!
1,She is not a good teacher at all and has a bad attitude!
1,I have hated english all my life  then my senior year I got a good teacher and liked it for a year. Now I have had Allameh and I hate the damn class. She was no help to me whatsoever. I hate the class and I espically will never take a Class from her Again. ENG 101 is crap and you have to take it  fine  just whatever you do  Don't take Dr. Allameh!!
1,This class was one of the worst experiences in my life. I usually enjoy English classes  but this changed my whole idea of what English is supposed to be. I did not like this class at all!!!!!
1,she is a horrible teacher!!!! never take this class  i done well before her  and she was no help with writing papers!
5,very easy class  hardly no homework or papers.
1.5,"English was one of my favorite subjects and I always did well..until Allameh's class. Unclear instructions  biased grading  and ""busy work"" assignments that did nothing but waste my time."
1,YUCK...!!!
1,HORRIBLE CLASS! DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!!

1,This has been the most disorganized course I have ever taken. Expectations are not clearly expressed. When you ask for help or clarification  you do not receive it.
1,Dr. Brown is by far the most incompetent teacher I have ever had in my entire higher education experience. If she is what we can expect from teacher education at UK  than UK does not take teacher education seriously. Disorganized. Unreasonable. Unclear. Incompetent. Ineffective.
1.5,Poor communication and organization of course materials and student expectations.
5,Great information. I learned a lot in this course. I would recommend this class for all preservice teachers
5,Excellent
5,Great Experience. Very know knowledgeable and helpful.
2.5,Totally disorganized.
2.5,Sometimes unorganized and boring but seems to be passionate about education.
1,No Comments
2.5,He is very specific of what he wants but doesn't tell you anything. He grades with a letter/lower letter grade and decides your grade based on how he feels at the time. He has no legit way of grading.
4,In the main  I would say Dr. Bieber is quite demanding and depending the sensitivity of the topic can come across as a pedant. infinitesimal vocabulary  wealth of experience  however definite declivity toward student affairs  depressing. this course serves as a rite of passage to the EPE'rs  not for the faint of heart...the life of the mind!
3.5,Thought the course was okay  but somewhat boring. We seemed to always discuss surface issues and not the real deep philosophical stuff. Jeff is a good scholar - one of his articles was part of the syllabus  and it was a great article. But  we really didn't get into the theory behind it - i.e. cultural reproduction. Could have been better.
5,Started off not liking the class  ended up loving it and Dr. Bieber. We had some real dumb***es in there and Dr. Bieber was really patient with them even though we were not. Dr. Bieber seems like a hard core Republican  but he really is a bleeding heart liberal  which I like. Great class and great instructor!!!
5,Great professor!
5,No Comments
2.5,boring  not inspiring  and doesn't teach. he just babbles all class  and all the learning is you reading the textbook. quizzes and tests have nothing to do with any material learned in class.
1,DO NOT take his class  unless you want to rip your hair out for an hour and 15 min. He is so delirious. He talks about his life stories the whole class and anything unrelated to what we are supposed to be learning  which makes the tests impossible.the only thing i learned about psychology is that the more i listen to him  the dumber i get.
2.5,He is an extremely sweet and cheesy old man but unfortunately he's also a total snore! Psychology should be an interesting course and he just doesn't present information in an interesting manner  it's almost impossible to take notes on anything he says.
1,Nice smart professor.However the class is a joke.He does not cover the material in the text. It is almost impossible to stay awake when he is speaking.If you are a motivated student you can do well. If you are not  stay away from this course.
3.5,a really nice guy. The whole class sleeps and he makes really corney jokes but it's a easy A. The test are easy and the final paper is only two pages and he is very generous with giving out A's. I recommend this class.
1,This class is SO BORING. I have never had such a boring class. He doesn't talk about anything to do with the text. I did not know it was possible to talk 3 hours about ABSOLUTLY NOTHING. Easy A if you do the homework  just don't expect any reading to be covered in class!
3,Old guy who reminds me of my grandfather and tells really corny jokes. the whole class sleeps but a really easy class if youre into reading out of the text book. Quizzes on each chapter once a week...T or F. and he lets you make up tests if youre not there  easy A
5,No Comments
4.5,He share stories alot. Easy and fun class to be in. There weekly quizzes count 66% of the total grade  final counts 33%. The quizzes are directly from the notes and chapters. Just read and/or pay attention and you should pass with flying colors.He drop 2 lowest quizzes and his final are based on weekly quizzes. If you do good weekly  then it ez A
5,Shel is a fantastic teacher. He wants everyone to understand the material and he keeps it interesting. All of the tests come straight from his notes and one paper...nothing to sweat. Just attend class  take notes  and study...it's that easy..got an A!!
4.5,i took shel's psych class when i was a junior in high school and he was nothing but helpful and willing to do extra for his students. he is funny and keeps class interesting.
3,Shel gives psychology the reality kick! It can be hard to read his handwriting on the board. He only gives a midterm and a final. The final IS NOT cumulative. A paper is expected. You are basically graded on attendance  participation  the paper  and 2 tests. Know your stuff. He's a cool guy  especially for the older students.
2,He talks A LOT and will get off on a tangent often! I got an A in his class but i didn't learn much. He makes you summarize 6 journal articles which are impossible to understand and you can't learn anything from them. he is a nice man but not a very good teacher. i learn more on the days when we had a sub.
4.5,Great Teacher. Very entertaining.TAKE NOTES.His exams are mostly his notes.If you pay attention you could easily get a good grade.
5,Great teacher  entertaining and nice. TAKE NOTES. Tests are a little difficult and the research paper sucks! But if you do the work and get it in on time you'll get a good grade. Very fair.
5,Professor Schwartz is one of the most fun teachers I have had in years  and has some really funny stories
4,Professor Schwartz is one of the most fun teachers I have had in years  and has some really funny stories
5,BEST TEACHER IVE EVER HAD. Made sitting three hours straight a pleasure and had me wanting more psych. once the 3 hours was over. A great guy  very very funny  unbeliebably passionate  pleasant  and down to earth. I would take every class with him if I could. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
4,His lectures are great. Book is terrible. He does write alot on the board however his tests are difficult  MC questions (50) confusing at times. Research paper is rough however if you do it he will give you a good grade....Not an easy A
4,Fun teacher. Writes alot on the board  take notes!! You will be tested on the notes. Research paper is killer  be prepared. All in all he is a cool guy  looked forward to coming to class.
4.5,An invested and intelligent professor. His classroom is casual and Socratic  his manner is relaxed and discussive. He is a little disorganized but makes up for it with his passion for seeing his students grasp the material. A1.
5,Dr. Farmen quickly became one of my favorite professors. He is so smart and will take time to help you. His classes are not the easiest but they are challenging. He is funny too. One of the best!
1,No Comments
4,Amazing. That's really all I have to say.
5,Farmen is one of the best professors at this university. He pushed the envelope for our class and got us to really delve deep into our thoughts and gain so very much from his class. It was a great life experience and I would recommend him more than any other prof. Also  since his class is mainly discussion  there's little real homework either!
1,i absolutly hated the class!! he was horrible! I can't believe that he can teach at all!!
4.5,hes nuts and crazy but GREAT! He is so smart!
5,GENIUS. he was the reason i switched my major because he said it wasn't challenging me in any way. now i love what im doing. thanks dr. farmen.
4,Very good teacher. Hilarious. The first day of class with him  I was sure he was **** (He wasn't
5,Dr. Farmen challenges your preconceptions  makes you question your opinion  then helps you articulate what you really mean. He is great at teaching lectures and at directing discussion courses.
5,Wonderful! Incredibly unique teaching method
4.5,Dr. Farmen's style is very interesting. Very enjoyable in class  although he talks about sex WAY too much. I said he wasn't hot cause he's like 70 years old.
2,he is crazy  he knows so much but he s difficult to understand because he is always everywhere! so so smart though
4.5,He's a little insane  in a good way. He is a great friend too.
5,Wonderful teacher. You will learn so much about life and yourself in his courses.
5,No Comments
4.5,Hilarious  but very knowledgeable...good prof!
5,Dr. Farmen is by far the most practiced and advanced prof I've ever studied under. His understanding of human behavior  motivation  and inner-workings is truly a great resource when studying Psychology. I will use what he's taught me every day!
2.5,Mary doesn't seem to care about learning  fairness or knowledge as much as she cares about preening and posing in front of a room of people. Not a good teacher.
1.5,Expects way to much without being very flexible
4,Very intersting class  though lots of reading. The lectures were all discussion and we were allowed to resubmit each paper once. It was important to do all the reading and attend most classes  but all in all very reasonable.
1.5,No Comments
4,Very interesting.
1,this was a pointless class  the assignments were pointless
2,No Comments
3,No Comments
4,Unreasonable assignments (Annotated bibliography as long as paper)
5,Nice guy. Works with you if you have a problem. I dislike psychology  but really enjoyed Mr. T's class.
4.5,Tests very hard  failed everything except made a C on final and somehow managed to make a C in class  if you are having a hard time go talk to him about it act interested in his class and if you are a girl act interested in him and he will pass you  dress cute and flirt  but class is pretty hard
5,He was a very good teacher. I enjoyed his class quite a bit. He has many interesting stories to tell. He knows his stuff. Watch out for pop quizes in this class!!
4,Makes alot of jokes  talks about his past work quite a bit  and makes what could be a blah subject  pretty fun and finds ways to get things to stick into your mind. Overall a pretty great teacher  and you can talk to him about anything. theres always someone who blurts out random things in class
5,Prof. T is one of the best profs I've ever had. His reviews are helpful  he has a good sense of humor and he keeps the lectures interesting. Not to mention he MAJORLY pads your grades...I failed most pop quizzes and still made an A in the class
5,Mr. Tiefenwerth is a very good professor. His reviews are extremely helpful and very accurate towards the test. He is very fair and is willing to work with anyone. He is understanding and empathetic with students because he is one himself.
3.5,He rambles and his reviews have little to do with his test. If you keep up it is all pretty fair
5,Study vocabulary and read a bit of the chapter  show you are trying  show up and participate in class and you will do fine. He is a wonderful professor.
2,Extremely harsh and arbitrary grader. She DOES lie (in this case  about grades)and provides little to no help  despite student requests. Unclear about grading and assignment requirements despite seemingly clear assignment descriptions & syllabus etc.
2,Two words: NUT JOB! This is one kooky chick. Lady  you LIED to us.....and I told you that you LIED  and you never bothered to correct yourself.
2,she's a little confusing and a little cooky  but pretty cool at the same time.

5,This is the best class I have taken at U of O so far. It gives incredible insight into the dark side of self in religion just like the title suggests. Beyond that  it really teaches you a lot about yourself  I started my journey of self-discovery  which is something I did not think I would be saying. It is an amazing class  I highly recommend it.
5,Guys. Take this class. I have learned more about myself through learning about the dark self than at any other point in my life. Not to mention Mark is one of the funniest  nicest and most intellectual professors I have ever had  and never have I been bummed when the hour and fifty minutes is up and I have to wait to go to class again. Amazing
5,Professor Unno is a top-quality educator. His passion for the subject is apparent in the way through which he presents the material. Incredibly knowledgeable and entertaining. I do recommend that you keep up with the reading  but if you get a little behind Professor Unno will cover the material thoroughly in class. Highly recommended!
4,Professor Unno gives amazing lectures but at times they can be confusing or he gets off track. He has a clear grading criteria but is picky in how he wants things done. Overall he is a kind professor who genuinely cares about his students and what he is talking about. He is very knowledgeable and I would recommend him.
5,Mark Unno is an amazing profesor. He's hilarious and the amount of work you have to do is really reasonable. There's 2 short tests and a few papers. The readings are pretty basic  too. I'm by no means a 4.0 person but this class is very doable.
3,Too hard of a grader for a 101 class. GE grades  but follows Unno's guidelines and it's a bit ridiculous. I'm no straight A student  but I do well on essays and I got a grade I wasn't expecting. My GE later said it's hard to receive an A on essays in this class. Essays are a good part of the class. First test also included Q's about grammar? Why?
5,He's really funny if your class is well behaved. He really likes teaching. It's not a super fun class  but he makes it fun.
3.5,Interesting  engaging lectures. He's a cool guy that always has interesting stories to help you understand. A lot of papers and a couple tests  and a ton of reading  but the whole class is fairly laid-back and interesting so it doesn't feel like a big workload.
4.5,Great teacher with interesting experience and a delightful sense of humor. You'll learn a lot in his classes!
5,Probably the greatest teacher I have ever had. Taking his class actually changed my outlook on religion and life. You must go to class and listen!! He is an amazing lecturer and is extremely knowledgable. He makes all his philosophical points easy to understand  often using his cats as examples  haha  or ice cream. Highly recommended. Amazing Prof.
5,Greatest  funniest  more intelligent teacher I've ever had. Incredible. Very philosophical but used incredible analogies to help the class understand what he was talking about. Absolutely hilarious in lecture. Extremely knowledgeable about his field. I have profound respect for Mark Unno and look forward to taking more of his classes in the future.
4,Unno was the leader of my fig and he made it quite interesting. While the lectures seemed long sometimes  he was able to mix music such as Miles Davis with philosophy and make it totally mindboggling. Unno KNOWS how to give a good thoughtout speech.
5,Probably the best teacher I've ever had. He just makes the whole class interesting. He's easy to understand and is very funny.
5,Amazing teacher! I've taken two classes from him and he's always very insightful and understandable. readings were excellent and the class was easy because he makes it so engaging! Take a class from him! Take seven! You wont regret it!
1.5,I thought that taking an Asian religions course would be semi interesting  but Professor Unno made this class a pain to go to. I couldnt really understand what he was saying because he says everything in a philosophical sort of way and didnt really get straight to the point. Make sure you do all of the readings!!
4.5,I thought it would be easy so didnt work as hard as I should have. He teaches in stories but is somewhat interesting. You have to pay attention. Easy class but make sure you are not sidetracked and actually try to listen or you will have to re-learn everything he says before the tests.
5,Unno is an amazing teacher. I took Medieval Japanese Buddhism with him this past winter. He is the funniest teacher I have ever met  very down to Earth  very real  personable  intelligent  and very eloquent in his lectures. Everybody take one of his classes
3,A very funny and entertaining teacher  with somewhat lack luster lecture material.
4,this guy took me a while to figure out  but after a few weeks i was completely sold. his classes and wisdom actually helped me in my personal life and a lot of the reading he assigned is some of my favorite literature now. he is the kind of professor that makes me feel better about paying a gajillion dollars a term in tuition.
4.5,One of the best professors I have had at the university of oregon. Very helpful. : )
5,He is a very helpful and nice professor.
5,what a guy.
5,Nice guy  always there for help if you need it.
5,No Comments
5,Amazing! I looked forward to every class. He is extremely smart and one of the leading UCC scholars. If you listen to him  you will realize he is hilarious and a true gem. To pass  do the readings and go to class. He is always willing to talk to students after class on the bricks  so participate in that when you can.
1,Elements with WidenI'm sorry this happened to you. DO the reading. Take notes of HOW the Justices argue the topics. Make categories of the arguments: Historical  Textual  etc. DO the questions he gives recurringly for FINAL EXAM practice. ATTEND class  he reviews information. Talk to him after EVERY class about class and write down his views.
5,He is the best professor at UM. He is smart. Classes are boring sometimes but it would be good to learn. Don't miss practice classes (the most important). Check the outlines  and read !!!!!
1,Nobody knows what he wants to teach in this class. There is no syllabus  no grading information  no battle plan to attack the class. His lectures are boring  and his sense of humor is lacking and annoying. His final is straightforward but no one knows how he grades and how he came up with his inconsistent grades. I will avoid him
3,His classes are fun and entertaining. Really smart guy but kind of disorganized in his teaching methods. Extremely practical. You are not clear as to how to study for the exams.
2.5,Although he was a nice man and very intelligent  the way he conveyed the material was very unorganized. I studied so hard for this exam and felt completely dumbfounded on the exam. He gives true or false questions on the exam that are extremely tricky and in no way indicative of how good of a law student you are. He needs to change his 1L methods.
1,Horrible textbook that he is writing and emails the sections out as he writes them. He is a horrible teacher. Hard to follow  all over the place  and not clear. DON'T TAKE THIS GUY IF YOU HAVE THE CHOICE!
1,Confusing  unclear  kind of all over the place.
4,Smartest professor at UM. He is extremely detailed because in addition to being a genius  he was actually a partner at Cravath  so he practice experience. He likes you to be exact  and sometimes he goes really deep into problems that won't be on the exam. He isn't an easy grader either. Hilarious and makes you think hard. Cool guy to talk to.
4,Hot!
5,Phenomenal instructor. He KNOWS contracts  and he KNOWS the UCC. He doesn't just teach theory. He teaches the class in a practical  realistic way  and he forces us to think the same way. He's done more than most profs to show me how the law and lawyers work in the real world.
2,Contracts-had no book. Focus on the UCC and the Restatement. Buy Crunch Time to follow the course and E&E to do practice problems. Skim over the cases to understand what concepts and what part of hte UCC and the RST he will go over in class. Do NOT focus on the cases!
2,Poor! VERY poor!
4,Great professor. He knows the material and enjoys teaching it. Exam was straightforward. I would suggest using E&E though.
4,Very good professor. Always willing to talk outside of class. His exam was tough as expected but he gave us one of the essay questions in advance so that was more than fair. His true/false and multiple choice questions were tricky though.
5,Best prof ever. He was a partner at Cravath  so he has a REAL understanding of business law. If you are tired of the theory/policy **** of other classes and the disconnect between what you learn in class and what you'll do in practice  you will LOVE any class taught by Widen. Exam is difficult but exactly what you expect  no cheap tricks.
1.5,Professor is very smart but does not do a good job of conveying the information which he knows. Attendance doesn't really matter and you can get a good grade even without going to class but he expects you to know everything he covers. Relies heavily on the UCC. Very hard grader.
3,Very smart and funny/sarcasitc - def. knows the material. Problem is: won't teach it to you. Calls on students (ClassMaster  or takes volunteers) but doesn't use Socratic - will expect you to answer your own questions. Bad choice for such a crucial 1L subject - a shame b/c he is very smart and entertaining but the combo is wasted potential on 1Ls
4.5,The test was a lot better than I expected. But not easy. Never went to class. Only read Gilberts supplement.
3.5,Favorite professor of the semester. very cool. very hard and sometimes hard to follow  but overall great.
3,Make sure to go to class and write down how to do her problems!! If you go to her office hours she tries so hard to help you  even though sometimes her explanations arent the best. You can easily get a B even if you fail the final...
5,Professor Chase is passionate about physics  which can be seen by her marked enthusiasm during lecture. She does a great job of explaining different concepts. As someone who has always dreaded physics since high school  Professor Chase's lectures made physics bearable  and in some cases  even fun.
3,If you don't go to class  don't expect to do well  even though attendance isn't mandatory. It can feel like a waste of time  but if you bother listening  you'll understand the material better especially come time for the final. If you do well on tuneups and the appendix hw then you'll do fine on exams and the final  they're exactly the same thing.
3,The class is easy if you just do the supplemental tune up homework to study for the exam as they are exact copies of each other. Norma herself has some quirky characteristics about her and lecture is like a random dimension and makes no sense. Just do the homework for the extra credit and you will get an A. The final is like the appendix though.
4,Good Teacher. Make sure you go to class because the problems she reviews in class are the same on the exams and she DOES NOT RECORD HER LECTURES. There are 3 Exams  Mastering Physics Homework  and a Final Exam (which is cumulative ). Exams are all Multiple Choice  some true or false.
1,She is so off the wall and hard to follow. Entire grade is based off of 3 exams  masteringphysics and one final. That's IT. Her exams are all multiple choice and super specific to how she teaches. If you dont write down exactly how to do her problems  good luck.
2.5,If you go to class and follow along and do tune up exam problems you should be totally fine. Final can be brutal because it's not like the tune ups but with the easy tune ups you'll already have a high average to cushion for the final.
1,Attend her class or you won't know what you're doing. The notes she posted online (posted a day before the exam at that matter) does nothing to assist your studies. She does not explain her answers through her notes so you have to be in class that day to understand anything that is going on. Also very confusing during office hour.
3.5,"Chase is such a nice Professor. She loves Physics. There's many old Exams floating around which aids studying. Her exams are not difficult  per se  but one must prepare a lot buy keeping up w/ trying problems over and over. Chase passed me w/ a ""D""after I averaged a 45.5% w/ the Final. Lab counts as a test grade too and I think I got 85%. Roughly a ~55% avg. got me a passing grade. I was a senior and went to talk to her though. ??"
3,Chase taught me absolutely nothing in her class. everything i learned was mostly through past exams.LEGIT THOUGH  find past exams cause her test will most definitely be the same exact thing. just different #s. the appendix hw are ridiculous and impossible BUT they will help you on your final if you are studious with it. FINAL was a killer !
1.5,Tests challenging - final was ridiculous
4,Professor Chase is very enthusiastic. She LOVES physics. Her constant nodding and running across the room kept me thoroughly entertained. I learned a great amount in this class.
1,She has crazy eyes and makes no sense. The homework is ten thousand times harder than her tests. BOO.
3,Very enthusiastic about physics. very weird twitching habits  especially with eyebrows. But overall a nice teacher. Physics 1 is really easy  but physics 2 is very hard.
3,wierd lady... the exams are easy  but the final is like 5 times as hard as the regular tests... just make sure your prepared for that
2,um  yea... this class is really easy at the beginning  but gets very hard at the end. norma is a very interesting woman id have to say...
3.5,she tries really hard to teach us the topics  but still is not really clear. the course is pretty easy in the beginning  but definitely gets a lot harder toward the end  and the final is a killer. labs are also a waste of time
2,She is nice  but does not teach in any kind of reasonable way.

5,Professor Barden is amazing  lots of extra credit provided and gives awesome memorable examples  which helps to understand the material and that's how I studied! Awesome professor!
5,One of the easiest classes at mcp as of yet for me.. 100% would take him again if I could! I cannot recommend him enough. Study the slides and you'll do great on the exams (all MC). Extremely easy A. Lab is also much easier than freshman bio labs!
5,Ned is an easy professor. Just review the slides before the exam and you will get an A. He gives numerous amounts of extra credit. If you pay attention in lecture then reviewing won't be much at all. There are old exams and study guides to prepare you. Easy A
5,He was a great professor very specific in what is and is not going to be on the exam.
5,Awesome professor  he made Micro interesting. Such a genuine and funny guy  he really cares about his students and does a great job portraying the material. All of his lectures are online which helps with exams so much. Would 100% take him again if my major required me to. Great dad jokes.
3,We had a paper and a poster  which was typical for this class and not horrible  made the paper due in the middle of the semester which worked well for me. However  with assignments and due dates he was inconsistent and changed them frequently. I don't mind getting a later due date but wish he would make up his mind
5,Absolutely loved Ned! His lectures made the subject so much more bearable than it would've normally been. He's so funny  and his tests are basically his powerpoints. I hated the lab  but he had nothing to do with that. Such a great personality  gonna miss the guy.
4,lectures are helpful (majority of what is covered in lecture will be on the exam)  he posts study guides & past exams to help you prepare for each upcoming exam  there are many extra credit opportunities- if you don't take advantage of it there's something wrong with you.
5,His dad jokes are amazing.
5,Great professor. You need to study and show up to class  but if you study his powerpoint slides  you will do well on the exams. He makes lecture fun and he jokes around a lot. One of the best teachers at MCPHS and he genuinely wants you to do well. He gives some easy  fun questions on exams sometimes for extra points. I would take him again!
5,Barden is amazing  he explains micro without torturing you like some other teachers. He is more keen on you understanding the larger picture and wants you to apply logic also during his exams. I loved his lectures  his hilarious so that helps  and always open for you to pop up during office hours for extra clarification. Hands down my fav prof :)
5,Barden was by far my favorite teacher. He is hilarious and makes microbiology interesting  easy to understand  and lectures aren't boring. You DONT NEED BOOK. All tests could be done right off of his slides. Amazing professor.
4.5,Barden was awesome and did a great job of making microbio interesting. Very helpful  especially when you talk to him outside of lecture. The class itself is about the same difficulty as Bio 1 and 2  just a lot of memorization of slides. There are always free points and extra credit questions on his tests. And best of all you DO NOT NEED THE BOOK!
5,He is just an all around great person. Very funny and easy to understand.
5,Great class  Great professor. I recommend that if you don't go to class  get lecture recordings. His exams are pretty much 99% from his power point slides  but he says a lot of stuff that aren't on the slide and he will test you on. So just looking up the slides on BB wont help that much.
5,Dr. Barden is one of the nicest people you will ever meet  and his sense of humor is hilarious! All of the exams are based on the Powerpoint slides from lectures  and he provides study guides and practice exams. Just attending the lectures will probably earn you a high grade and the lectures are  for the most part  interesting.
4.5,Prof. Barden is hands down one of the most amazing professors I have ever had. His class is interesting and humorous and the exams are very fair! His lab is also very interesting and the most fun lab I have ever had! This class hands down was my favorite class at MCPHS so far. He is a very fair grader and is ALWAYS willing to help his students!
5,I was in Microbio class  such a sweet guy  soo nice and very intelligent. Grades very fair! A++ professor! Knows his stuff
5,I love this guy! He's hilarious and extremely intelligent. I've never had a professor explain the material so well. And what a novel idea (for MCPHS anyway) -- he actually makes sure to lecture on ALL the material that will be on the exams!!!
5,He's adorable! Easy class  and he's always willing to answer any questions you might have.
5,Orgo with Dr. Kelley is great  he is such a smart man and know just about everything there is to know about orgo. If you don't show up to class then I would suggest watching the lectures. If you don't do either then you're going to have a hard time trying to pass this class. The masteringChemistry homework helps! Do it!
4,I honestly don't understand the complains with this guy. I very much liked his lectures  even though they could be pretty dull especially in the beginning. The material is hard no matter what  but there are so many oppurtinities for extra help hours  and that curve though! He curved so incredibly much  it was awesome!
3,lectures aren't the best  you mainly learn the material by yourself. each exam is cumulative  first exam not a lot of people finish. he curves each exam but if you want to do well in this class you most definitely have to work for it.
3.5,Dr. Kelley is unbelievably smart. Its fascinating how much he knows  but he expects his students to know the same. The class is very tough. Need to review all his lectures and the book and do the problem sets. If you're willing to work  very doable. Overall  a great person and willing to help if you seek it. He's funny too  just pay attention
3,The class is hard no matter where it is taken  and he does try to make it clear what random small things may be on the test which is helpful and he looks like santa so theres that.
5,Doctor Kelly is extremely genuine and smart. If you have a good base in chemistry and read the materials before classes  you could understand all of his lectures and average in the B or A range at the end of the year. His exams similar to previous exams (secretly shared by students) and he always gives feedback in afterhours. strongly recommend
4.5,Dr. Kelley is extremely clear if you would open your ears and pay attention. Yes  just like every class  you need to go over notes and study. His exams are on par with what he teaches. Unfortunately A+ isn't an option in this school  but an A is just as good here. He has a great personality and always willing to help if you need it.
3,He looks like Santa Claus  no joke. On a more serious note though  his class isn't particularly difficult as long as you spend a whole lot of time studying and memorizing stuff. There usually is a curve both on the exam itself as well as for your last grade.
4,He is very nice and wants to help if you go to him for help. Read the material before class to actually understand what he is saying. Rewatching the lectures before the test also helps.
1.5,Horrible teacher  expects students to understand everything he's saying
1.5,"I studied my butt off for weeks before exams (books  previous tests) and still got blindsided and absolutely bombed the tests. Withdrawing was better than risking my GPA on ""maybe he'll scale it because he did last year."" I even went to him for guidance after exam I & was talked down at and shoo'd out of his office. Talk about not caring."
3.5,As much as I love Professor Kelley  I dislike his teaching methods. If you really want to understand orgo  read ahead cause in class  he assumes you already have and just starts speaking another language entirely to you. memorize everything he writes and i think you'll be fine cause thats what he puts in his paragraphs on the exams!
1,Printing out his lecture slides will get you no where. live  eat  and breath the textbook. Try looking up orgo guides books outside of class  they can explain things more simply than Kelly and the textbook. Be careful  there is no lab to help your grade in orgo2 like in orgo1. Good Luck!
2.5,Dr. Kelley definitely knows a thing or two about chemistry  and that enthusiasm shows. What he is not great at  though  is teaching concepts. That's where the textbook comes in  and reading the textbook is 100% necessary to do well in this course. Listen to him when he says to make flashcards
4,His class  though I found it challenging  is easier than other schools. The key to his class is not to just blindly copy whatever he writes  but to pay attention to what he says  and take notes on those things. While maybe not the most clear instructor  he's one of the nicest people  and even once photographed his class for his grandchildren :)
1,Makes almost no sense  does not even come up for a breathe to allow you to ask questions. unfortunately there is no avoiding him...
3,Dr. Kelley is a great professor! His class requires much textbook reading & old exam studying. Even if you're trying hard  but are doing poorly fear not  you will make it out alive. My test average was a 32 in Orgo II & I think I did a little better on the final. I got a D if that puts anything into perspective! Happy studying :)
4,He is great and interesting. Study everything in the notes and you will be fine. Do the old practice exams that he gives because they are really helpful. He gives so much bonus points that both semester I had averages over 100.
3.5,He is a kind instructor. He sometimes goes off topic with his notes since he writes them as we go along in class so no class have the same exact notes. The material is hard but he teaches it well. Watch out for his exams. There is a ton of material covered and you get about 50 min to complete. Pace yourself or you will run out of time.
5,I believe this was the easiest class I took at MCP. Sure  his material is challenging  but gives what  30 bonus points on each exam? Come on  I had like 110 average going into each final... Those who complain are just sick of having their drinking time cut into. Just wait till you get to biochem/Pcol...
3.5,He makes the class very interesting and he is an easy grader  great elective drugs and behavior and easy midterm/final exams.
5,This was someone that I actually rightfully trusted to discuss my future in pharmacy. I had him for transfer seminar and found him to be one of the brightest  informative and moral people. A classmate that had him for Drugs and Behavior said the guy is fascinating. I look forward to his class. I want all the prep I can get. Before Drug Lit.
5,Boring! Good thing I had this class! NOT! Do I get a refund? Dont laugh--wait till drug lit.--u will wish u paid attention! But do we really have to go thru it twice!
5,Despite the fact that his class is pretty easy  it's all really neat stuff you learn. This class is definitely worthwhile.
3,No Comments
4.5,his class is really easy...all you have to do is come to class to turn in homework and u'll be fine
3,Yasger is a very liberal person and wants to have a good time. She jokes alot  is loud  but makes an immpression. Unfortunately  one day she was gone and we were told something happened and she left our class. Personally  she didn't teach an english class  more like a debate class. I wouldn't recommend taking her if your looking to learn eng. 101!
5,she's soooo funny! she has a lot of BFF's their all movie stars haha  and she's secretly married to brad pitt haha! she's super funny you'll love the class its easy if you do all ur work  if your lazy then don't take the class
4.5,very entertaining class. enjoy going to class. for each writing assignment she give you an example of what an A papers is. be on top of your reading for the quiz. there are extra credits. I would take her again if she teaching Eng. 103 but unfortunately she not.
5,She is hard  but a lot of fun! definatly do the reading!!
4.5,I have to agree she is a great and fun teacher. its true that she talk about her family but she have reasons why she do it and also i took my paper to the tutorial center  but they are the one that dont not correct it well.
4.5,She is the best english teacher i have ever had! i would reccomend her to everyone. i thought this was the easiet english class i have ever taken  and she is hilarious.
5,She is absoluly the most intresting english teacher shes funny  fair and easy if you do ALL THE WORK. You will write 5-6 papers and watch 6 movies and 7 quizes if you do it youll pass . put a time in to your paper and youll get A's on them. i use to hate english but now i dont.
1,She is the worst teacher on the earth  she will make you hate school for the rest of your life!!! She gives Fxc2xb4s on essays!!I hate her so much  I took my essay to the writing center and instrudtors told me my essay was good but she gave me a D!! How horrible you can get!!!! avoid her !!!
5,Great teacher! She may seem a little intimidating at first  but she is fun and laid back. I was deathly terrified of oral presentations  but she made it fun. If you are afraid of public speaking  take this teacher. You won't regret it. Oh and rumors are true she does let you out early.
3,At first  she seems like she is going to be easy and lax  but as the semester rolls  she gets harder and harder! She expects everyone to be english scholars  and on my first essay  she gave me an F! And I take my time on my essays. If you think getting on her good side will help you  it won't!
2,"The worst teacher ever. Way too hard to get a C !! SO imagine an ""A"". Unless  you are an English instructor you can get an A. I did not enjoy her class at all. Instead of teaching  she talks about her family."
2.5,I thought she does not like minorities  I did not enjoy her class at all. She is hard on grading.
5,Highly entertaining. Doesn't keep you longer than you need to be there. Simple assignments  though they do require work. Fun class.
5,She is very helpful and her class was the first english class I enjoyed. Before her  I avoided it like the Plague. Now I wish she taught more classes!
5,She is very fun  and funny. She loves to tell stories and incorporate them into her topics. She made it fun to do the work in and out of class  I really enjoyed having her.
5,Super laid back. Not too difficult. Don't worry about staying in class for the entire class...she lets us out over an hour early. In class is easy but you have to be able to do the work outside of class in order to do well
5,she is very easy and relaxed she makes life simple for you explains things really well she hates people that are late and she lets you out early she is funny enthuziastic and discussions are fun in her class plus no hw & this is not a boring class
5,Class was Fri. 8am-12. The first day she said 8am is too early so class started at 9am after that. We got out at 11:30 making a 4 hour class 2.5 hours. Everything else is just as relaxed.
5,He is good as long as you expect what the subject entails. The course is intended to cover all the basic aspects of database management systems and the professor does a satisfactory job at it. He does teach outdated technologies so beware of that. Also he will make you work hard and cares about the effort you put in the project. Overall good course
2,Lectures were pretty unclear and his assignments were pretty difficult. If it wasn't for his extremely lenient grading  I'd probably be failing.
1,Boring lectures  makes you work too hard for the grade  taught an under-grad level course for grad students  exams are too lengthy designed not check your knowledge
5,Good lecturer. The presentations do get dull sometimes but you can't expect much from the subject on databases. I had a clear understanding what would be on the exam and the grades looked pretty good. If you do the expected work then the grade should be high. The final project was rather interesting and turned out pretty well for our group.
3,There weren't many actual lecture since 80% of the class were presentations held by students. The grading criteria was very unclear  although he usually gave good grades. But be aware  all assignments were group projects with the same group throughout the semester.
4,He is really nice at teaching. He won't mind at all even if you go and ask him the same thing thrice. TA's can be better. He grades well if you write your answers correctly. I amd my friends always scored more than what we expected.
1.5,irresponsible  the answer of exam may be wrong  you need to check very carefully after you are graded  otherwise you will easily get a low score  since it is graded based on a wrong answer!! He is very irrespective to students  the standard for project grade is very unclear  if you argue with him he will satire you and let you shut up!
3.5,View lessons online as needed to learn the material because as previously commented he simply goes through powerpoint  but it does appear that the powerpoint is designed by him to accomplish course objectives. Project is huge so make sure you get a responsible group. After this class I was definitely more interested in Databases.
5,Useful course. Lots of material covered. Good clarity!
2,He's really not that bad. The lectures were rather boring  but the tests weren't awful. Homework was far more difficult than the lecture made it seem. The project is massive  but if you're interested in computer science and programming  it should be fun. Don't procrastinate!
1,I could have gone into databases research  but this guy made databases the ugliest of my nightmares. He is dull and boring. His lectures are worthless. Last test was a disaster. Didn't cover more than half of it in class. His TAs are worse  barely speaking English and grading ridiculously harsh. Take Jermaine. Schneider is not a good professor.
5,Has very good knowledge of subject  nice prof.
3,Easy A but you have to suffer through Schneider's boring lectures. Recommended only for a GPA boost.
5,very helpful. course lectures very well structured. best prof i have come across.
5,gr8
2.5,Schneider is a poor educator but he does seem to know the material. He changed the weighting of assignments several times throughout the semester which was annoying. The class project was far too large in scope and felt more like slave labor since it took hundreds of hours to complete (yes  really).
1,Never attended his lectures because all he did was read them to you from his powerpoint slides. Is not helpful during office hours. Likes to ridicule people when they ask questions that he thinks are stupid.
1.5,This guy came from Germany to practice his English by reading lecture notes almost word for word. You will get nothing out of class. You have to teach yourself how to do the class project  and he refuses to put a copy of the text in the library.
1,Your grade depends on how much she likes you instead of how well you do with your work. If you are ethnic minority  the chance she doesn't like you is very high and you'll be discriminated against in many possible ways  especially in those areas almost impossible for students to challenge her decision. She enjoys breaking hearts for no good reasons
4.5,Love Susan. She is so friendly and so energetic. If she's hard on you it is because she has your best interest at heart. She is very approachable if you have any issue with her or her marking. Such a wonderful teacher.
1,"Unclear expectations  treats you like a child and doesn't listen to anything students say. Really disrespectful and unhelpful. Gives good feedback but doesn't provide the support to apply the feedback. Hard marker  especially in practicum. Never answers emails  or requests a ""meeting in person""... Just pray for the semesters that you have her..."
3.5,Susan is a fantastic teacher. I don't understand how people say she isn't  but to each their own! Yes  she talks a little fast in lecture  but has no problem repeating herself if needed. She is understanding  friendly  and approachable. Susan actually makes classes fun. I don't find her to be a hard marker whatsoever. She gives great feed back!
3,She speaks really quickly and it's sometimes hard to take notes  but she gives out powerpoints. she makes her classes interesting and fun with her silly stories. hard marker but gives amazing feed back. overall  one of my favorite teachers in the program!
2,"This lady may seem hilarious and bubbly the first time you take her class  but my oh my is she fake! her lectures i like ""whaaaat"" she talks way too fast for you to even take notes. Barely ever replies to your emails. Tough in Practicum. and her exams are way more difficult than u would expect because her lectures or so damn brief."
2.5,Very hard marker and will fail you for no real reason. You can spend nights doing a project  and she won't give a jack.
1,She made it difficult to ask questions. She made me feel like I was an idiot by not understanding. She seems veryyyyyy intimidating.
5,The best
5,Best teacher ever!
1,hard marker. you can write a whole page but she will only mark some. Biased. favours many. Once tried to talk to her and she stood there looking back and forth around the room while I was talking to her and frankly didn't give a cow. Lectures are all over the place. Can't sleep because she will catch you and make you watch.
3,She is nice.
1,Don't take Early Childhood Education Diploma at Langara College. She is the worst and terrible instructor in the world.
1,She is the worst teacher I've ever had. SERIOUSLY. Not sure how she got her teaching degree or if she even has one! Lectures are random and hard to follow. Confusing and unfair grading scale! Just try to PASS her class!
1,Ask her about the time she was in high school and got in a fight and ripped off another girls ear...
1,She is very ramdom you can take notes from her lectures because she can't stay on any one topic. Her tests are marked inconsistantly with her own personal bias for each individual favorite person. As chair person  LAZY is the only word that comes to mind  her needs are the only one the counts.
4.5,A nice teacher and gives a useful amount of information with lots of hand outs.
1,not helpful @ all....i wish i can say something nice about her.
1.5,NOT that easy to talk to
1,No Comments
5,Val knows her stuff  teaches it in her own style and lets you know what is expected on assignments. Follow her notes and advice and you will do well.
4.5,Great teacher.
2,"She is one of the worst teachers i have had. She seems to be going through the ""change"" this year  2007. She is in a bad mood at least 3 times a week and if you need clarification on an assignment she seems to careless and is bothered that you would ask. If your that tired  perhapes it is time to retire."
4,A very Straight forward person and explains stuff properly.A nice teacher overall.
4.5,she gives very valuable constructive feedback if u ever needed it for an assignment or for practicum. she tends to be quite a hard marker  but she's a nice instructor nevertheless.
5,Great teacher  extremely supportive  made me excited to become a teacher.
5,Great teacher
4.5,Nice teacher
5,Supportive
4.5,Best person ever. She does get off topic but the things she talks about are so interesting. Even if everything you say is bull she will still listen and relate it to the class and make you feel smart. Once I thought a paper I wrote deserved an F and I ended up getting a 97.
2,Sarah is the sweetest person ever! She truly cares about her students and wants to see them succeed. Some of the readings were interesting and some of them I didn't care too much for. Most of the assignments were interesting but they were really unclear. Use your PLAs they will be a resource! She expects consistent participation as well.
1,Sarah is an enthusiastic teacher but is incapable of presenting anything clearly. Many class periods she will forget to go through her PowerPoint presentation that contains important course material. Expect lots of discussion but nothing of any significance.
5,She's the best professor I've had at Clark. She's very smart  passionate about what she teaches  and very approachable. I read other comments  and it's as if they had a different professor. Go figure. The one I had was absolutely wonderful.
4,Sarah is one of the best professors at Clark. She is enthusiastic about teaching  incredibly intelligent  and very warm-hearted and helpful. She is very inspiring and I would reccomend any one of her classes!
3,sarah is a very enthusiastic teacher  and she does let you get your thoughts out  but she really has issues with getting off topic. i get really frustrated with how little we actually end up covering in one class period. i feel that if she could only get her style of teaching more disciplined  she could be great.
1.5,Sarah is a great person  and a very easy grader but that doesn't make her a good teacher. Although she did know what she was talking about  she never really passed that knowledge on to the majority of the class. Everything I learned was through my PLA in sections. There was also a huge amount of difficult reading.
2.5,The class started out good  but then she seemed to totally get off track. I have no idea what she taught us in the second half of the semester. However  extremely lenient grader.
5,She's enthusiast  warm  intelligent  and very willing to help outside class.
3,She sometimes has no idea what she is talking about. All she does is read off her PowerPoint slide. She is really nice and sweet but she cannot teach. She is not very clear about what she is talking about and goes off topic. the only thing i liked about her class were the chocolates she brought for the class and her easiness on extensions.
4,Sarah is one of the most excited and positive professors i have encountered. Though her classes seem a bit disorganized  she is always willing to see students point of view. Shes a great person to work with outside of class-very helpful. So nice.
5,She's great!
1.5,"Not a big fan ""Sarah."" She teaches nothing in class. I spent hours with the study guide and found i had wasted my time when i took the exam."
2,Terrible.
2,She's really vague and very flaky. However  keep this woman in mind when needing recommendations or someone with a degree to back your opinion. She rocks  in that way. In all  she's one of those really accomplished people who has trouble communicating with her classes.
5,She's great!
5,I was a student in Ms Carol's class  some 15 yrs ago. I was new to BC and Canada. I found her to be a sensitive and caring individual. She was understanding and supportive. I found her to be well prepared for class and was thorough in her subject matter. I had a solid base to my ECE training. Thanks Carol(:

5,Great teacher. Very supportive and helpful. It's very clear how much she loves and respects children.
4,A very nice teacher and gives valuable information on books and literature for children.
1,She is a terrible teacher. She picks favorites and marks you according if she likes you or not. She has no idea on what she is teaching. She needs to learn more about children before she teaches others.
2.5,yep  she picks and chooses her favourites.
1,No Comments
1,She SUCKS!Has favorites if she doesn't like you  good luck!She failed one of my essays.I handed in the exact same essay to an other well known hard marker I got a high mark.She can't teach  doesn't know what she is doing so don't expect to learn anything from her. If she likes you you'll be fine.
5,I can't say enough about what a wonderful teacher she is.
1,Yet she preaches to be kind to children and that teachers need to be caring and giving. Once you get to know her you will realize that she herself isn't so kind and pleasant to her students.She also picks and choses students she wishes to help and not.
3.5,No Comments
3.5,Kind and Supportive
4,I took this class online over summer session. There is no textbook  but expect A LOT of reading of mini-lectures and articles. The 3 discussion posts a week take the most time to complete. But I did get a 95 on all other writing assignments because she is a pretty easy grader. I would recommend this class for an upper level gen-ed.
3,Take this class for you last gen ed! I took it online over the summer while taking another class and working 40hours a week  and still got an A-. Seems like it might be a lot of work  but it really isn't. Topics can be depressing at times  but they are interesting. USUALLY a fair grader.
1,She wrote the book...so guess what... you'll be buying it  however  you will only read about 20 pages...so buy it from a student who took the class last semester. Not the best teacher I ever had  but not the worst teacher either. Very intelligent woman.
5,Dr. Sgroi was one of the best professors I ever had the privilege to learn from. A true mentor!
4.5,No Comments
1,"Where I do begin this guy. I think he is old and senial personally. What he so called ""teaches"" in class makes no sense and he has these long random pauses in between thoughts. He even explained a problem in a foreign language during an exam and looked at us like we had the problem. Only benefit is OPEN EVERYTHING for EXAMS!!"
1.5,I deserved an A in this class. I was the only person who participated on a consistent basis and even corrected professor at times. He gives out participation points 3 times randomly. He gave me a B because I missed one of those days. I got an A on my work yet I got a B in the class. He royally screwed me over  I should have a person above him.
5,Super easy. Never thought I would get an A in stats. Tests are open book  open note open computer. Plus he give a test review with all the answers. Test questions straight from review!! EASY!!
1,HORRIBLE. Cannot teach. Yells at students and constantly belittles the class by comparing us to his chinese students. He did NOT curve for our class but compensated(since the class average is an F) by giving us free points. Either way  did not learn anything. STAY AWAY from this professor.
1,worst teacher. can't speak english. hard test although its open book. if you want to learn anything about statistics dont take this guy. also he gets mad and shouts at students.
1,worst teacher. can't speak english. hard test although its open book. if you want to learn anything about statistics dont take this guy. also he gets mad and shouts at students.
1,He sucks  only take him if you love to study on your own.
1,wow this dude cant even speak english. he is living proof that they are willing to give anybody a teaching credential. the tests arnt that hard if you study. its one of those classes that you have to teach yourself though.
1,Teacher is useless he doesn't no English  doesn't no how 2 teach. Do not take his class unless you like to teach yourself. His lectures are boring. He tries to explain the concepts and formulas without examples. He is not clear at all. His tests are hard and the questions have nothing to do with the hw. Most of the time doesn't no what he is doing!
3,The last person comment needs to take ESL yourself. I didn't understand the paragraph.
1,Sun needs a translator to teach in the US. He should take ESL himself before teaching others. I can still vaguely remember his incessant mumbling that maybe only he thought was actual language being spoken. Impossible to understand. He could have been speaking amazonian or latin for all we know.
1,This class is probably the easiest statistics class!! He's hard to understand but if you know how to study on your own you'll be fine. Just study the homework for the tests.
2,Oracle is hard enough - Instructor was not helpful at all. The book wasn't great either. I learned by working together with other students.
1,Impossible to understand. Difficult material and expected workload is far too much  however  some tests are open-book and copying HW is a must since he does not check it. Received a B...and didn't learn a damn thing.
1,The worst teacher ever! Lots of homework! Test are hard. Does grade on curve because everyone fails
1,Homework is too long  you can't understand what he says  he dislikes you if you disagree with him  if he doesn't like you he gives you zero participation points - there's not that many ways to participate in his class. he just rambles a lot about nothing.
1,The homework is like 100 pages long  and you never understand what he's saying. There's no point in going to class.
4.5,He made this class as painless as possible. Always helping you with your research. He's pretty funny so the class was enjoyable. So if you're looking for a 499 professor that isn't a pain  go for it.
1,I walked out of this class not learning a thing. He gives pop quizzes so you have to read the books which are so boring. He's funny  I actually enjoyed the class. All we did was watch youtube videos. The little work you do have  he is such a hard grader and very unclear on the actual assignment  all of us were always confused on what he wanted.
5,Dr. K is a pretty funny guy and he's very reasonable on assignments and grading. He really likes his upper division students and even brought us pizza. Easy B  but an A will require just a little effort.
4.5,SUPER LAID BACK. pretty simple class
2.5,very laid-back friendly and approachable.he really likes it when you participate in class discussions.can be confusing when giving instructions for assignments.assignments really make you think but doable.not a hard grader but read the assigned readings because he does ask questions
2,interesting professor. lectures are boring  movies are alright. go to class because he does take attendance when he sees a lot of empty seats. exams are either multiple choice or essays which he gives you the questions beforehand.
5,I like the guy. He's very helpful  wants his students to succeed. He tells you what he wants & if you follow him you should get an A. He posts his slides online. Some of my classmates got by without reading the chapters. I read/skim about the countries to help with the midterms  finals  and papers. He takes attendance but not everyday.
4.5,Great professor. It's an easy class if you do the following  listen  learn  and pay attention to detail in what he expects on papers. He's a very fair professor and is willing to help a student at anytime. I highly recommend him.
2,Not a bad professor by any means  but did not pique my interest in SE Asia. What angered me about him was that he seemed to really enjoy making students as uncomfortable as possible at times
3,Just look at the powerpoints he posts on BeachBoard  and you'll be okay for his exams. Rarely used the books
3,He either lectures the whole time or plays a video. All powerpoints you need are on BeachBoard  which are so helpful for the exams! Not everyone attends class  but he truly hopes his students do well in his classes  so he DOES care about his students. Not a super easy class  but it is possible to get an A. I didn't need the books.
2,I had no problem with his class. It was a pretty fair class for a 200-level course. I liked that his expectations weren't too much. He assigned 1 book on which you have to write an essay. It was a very interesting book. The exams were fact-based essays. As long as you know what happened  you're good. You don't have to know dates.
2,For a lower division class  he takes it too seriously. Tests are essays. One essay about a book which isnt too bad. Quizzes on the textbook are ridiculous he has 4 I believe and picks very specific topics  which we dont even go over during lectures which are SO BORING. His grades is a bit tough considering this is a GE class
1.5,He uses too many power points and then you get overwhelmed with too much general info and no clarity on specifics that you will be tested on.
4,Overall his class was not hard  but it definitely can't be taken lightly. He tells you ahead of time what the question are for the final so preparing is all up to you. The quizzes are from the book so reading is mandatory. He likes to reward those that attend class with extra credit points or a sneak peek of quiz. No reason not to take his class.
4.5,Enjoyed the class. Especially enjoyed the documentaries the second half of the semester. Professor piqued my interest in India and WWI  WWII and inter-war period.
4,seriously  nice guy  helpfull  just read the book(!)  gives extra credit points oportunity throughout the semester overall an easy class  just the usual guidelines  plus powerpoints are on line  but remember to read the book. Do NOT understand what the others commentators rated him low!
5,From day one everything is given online. Assignments are given and even the essay questions for the exams and final are also given on day one. He lectures a lot about what to write for the exams  so this class should be an easy ?A? or ?B? if you skim the book and go to class. Also gives extra credit opportunities. Professor Kaminsky is a nice guy.
4,I don't understand why some students have rated him badly. I think he is a COOL teacher ... I feel like I have learned a lot from this class  not from the lecture but from study for the exams. And I think his grading very fair. I think I got what I deserved and all effort I put for this class. I recommend to take this class and him.
1,ONE OF THE WORST PROFESSORS I'VE EVER TAKEN AT CSULB. Uses Powerpoints from 5 years ago. Lectures are completely useless. Counts attendance but there's no point in attending class. Study the book for the tests because his Powerpoints don't explain anything since he's probably using them for 5 different classes. Cancels class a lot...
4.5,Her class is an easy A and she is a really nice lady. Sometimes she can be confusing but she is very approachable and will help you with anything you need. I would recommend her to anyone.
2.5,SHE'S JOANTASTIC!!!!!!!!
2,If you want an easy A.. take this teacher! She isn't a very good teacher  but the material is pretty easy that you can learn it yourself. Homework is extra credit. Just take her.
3,She is a sweet old lady who at times tends to forget what she is doing. You don't have 2 go 2 class  you dont have 2 do homework  you can fail every quiz  and show up only on test days to get an A. If you know how 2 do the work take this class  if you want 2 learn how 2 dont.
3,Very easy class. She's not all that great of a teacher  but for Math111 you really don't need one. If you're somewhat good at math and just need this class as a requirement  then this is the one for you.
2,sooooooooooooooo boring. Go to the class before the test day  get the review sheet and study that and you should be okay. She rambles in class and you have absolutely no idea what shes talking about. Nice lady but so confusing. Attendance isn't mandatory and neither is the homework and quizzes. Take her if youre good at math and can teach yourself.
1.5,don't take her. she is very unclear and boring. the only thing thats good is that you can only go to test day and still get an A
3,Easy class  she is confusing at times  but the material is fairly easy so I wouldn't worry to much on that. She tries to help where she can...though her phone and internet frequently goes out. Offers study guides  and homework is extra credit.
3,she is probably the easist teacher you can get. She doesnt take attendance and gives study guides that make the test extremely easy  and homework is counted as extra credit. Super nice woman holds study sessions if you are having trouble. Take it
4,Easiest math class ever. Attendance is not mandatory and homework is extra credit. You can even make up one test at the end of the year. Granted she is not the best teacher  but the material is so easy and the tests are as well that you do not even need a teacher. Take her if you are not good at math and just want an easy A!
3,She was easy if you know what you are doing. A good review for if you already know the stuff  test are easy and quizes are too. Homework sucks but is extra credit  attendace doesn't count neither does tardiness. She is confusing though!
4,Quizes  Attendance and Homework are optional. I didnt do any of it. I showed up on test days only and got an A. Dont take her if you dont understand the matterial ahead of time b/c she will just confuse you. She is a sweet old lady and she was helpful if you needed it. She called me her mystery student b/c I never went to class but got an A
4,EASY!!! you dont have to go to class  she lets you do hw online and its extra credit  weekly quiz dont count if they hurt your grade  at the end lets you retake or make up a test of your choice.Test are from quizs and she makes copy of quiz with answers on them! No excuse to not have an A!!
3,She was very scatter brained and off topic ALL OF THE TIME! Her tests were easy  but wouldn't suggest her to friends.
1,This woman is insane...she has no idea how to teach or what she is talking about. It is impossible to learn from her and i will be sure to never take her again.
4,EASIEST CLASS AND TEACHER IN THE WORLD.I never came to class on time and never missed nothing shes a sweet lady but she tends to ramble on about nothing. easy . watch her on her basic and mental math she tends to get confused. But she makes everything simple.
1.5,Wow this lady is crazy. She wears the weirdest clothes and never wears two of the same shoe. If you have taken algebra before  this class will be simple. I only went to claa for the 4 tests and got an A because I knew the material. She makes a lot of math mistakes  so its hard to trust what she says. She lets you retake a test if you want.
5,THE EASIEST TEACHER IN HISTORY. I never came to class  never did homework  and I swear she gave me an A for a test I never took. The nicest  quirkiest  funniest old lady you will ever meet. Do not take her if you want to make less than an A. If you do not make an A you need a CAT scan.
2.5,Well- the class was SO easy- mostly b/c i took the same class in high school. I never did the homework- just sort of paid a little bit of attention and did fine. The tests are EXACTLY like the online review she puts up- except that the numbers are different. An easy A. Talk to her- she will be more willing to help if she knows your name.
4.5,I think she is a great teacher  but I really felt I shouldnt have placed in 111 in the first place. Total waste of time. Tests were easy  got a 97  94  90 so far she drops lowest test grade replaces it with a quiz average that stays out of /40 no matter how many easy quizzes you take.
5,awesome teacher  only wish he didnt have to leave for surgery.....we all miss his teaching. Def. understanding and polite and everything you could ask for of a teacher
5,Very good  easy. Realizes that not everyone is an english major.
5,I really enjoyed the the class. He always had an interesting story. Very layed back  but focused

1,Unfair and discouraging  a very hateful person
1.5,No Comments
1,Poor teacher  not good at all  not fair and not qualified
3,Professor Fox is extraordinarily knowledgeable. However  his lectures are invariably delivered at a snail's pace  in a very dry monotone.
4,Very smart  very understanding  great grasp of and interest in the subjects he's teaching. Respectful of student's different backgrounds and perspectives.
4,Professor Fox is a wonderful person and he is very intelligent. He knows what he's talking about although sometimes the lecture might be a bit boring because he just talk for an hour and occasionally show us images to demonstrate. But in general  very easy grader and exams are kind of easy too so this is the class to take if you want an easy A.
3,Professor Fox is a nice man  but his lectures can be boring.
4,Smart guy  lectures have a tendency to become dull and boring because of his speed of speech. Though I was very interested in the subject matter  I found myself on occasion having a hard time staying awake.
4.5,I really enjoyed having him for class! He is a really nice guy and is very helpful when asking him questions! I enjoyed the class a lot  despite the monotonous voice that sometimes made me want to go to class  but since a lot of things mentioned in class was new  I tried to stay awake.
4.5,Very nice and understanding professor. His dry humor is amusing although sometimes I find myself drifting during his class.
4,Fox is a really good professor  but you have to pay attention to catch his sense of humor.
4,Really nice guy - interesting and interested in subject. Monotoned so try to stay awake. Makes dry humored jokes which are funny when you pick up on them. I liked him. Take the class  its non-threatening.
4.5,Prof Fox is very helpful  a really nice guy. If you want to get into his class but itxe2x80x99s full  write him an e-mail  he is more likely than most to let you in.
5,Prof Fox is very clearly interested in what he's teaching  and his lectures are made interesting by his passion and by his fabulous sense of humor. Grading is extremely easy  so that's a plus. Also  Prof Fox went out of his way to work with me when I had to take the final at a different time. An incredibly sweet guy.
4,Not a difficult class  but not the most exciting class either. He is a good man with an interesting sense of humor  although I find the material a bit dull. It definetely is a good class to take if you want a low stress but educational class for bibical text.
5,i took 2 courses with fox this semester and i love both of them. i learn a lot in his classes and he makes even the driest stuff interesting. i definitely think anyone interested in history  jewish studies  or HGS should take at least once course with him.
5,Love him. Easy tester and grader  nice guy  a little dry but you learn a lot and he really is devoted to his students.
5,great class
4,Fox is awesome. The subject matter can be dull at times but he really knows his stuff and tries his best to make it interesting (which helps when it comes to paying attention). He is a fair grader and doesn't give any busy work. Take a class with him!
3.5,"I really enjoyed the disscussions in this class...when I could stay awake. Great guy  but ""dry wit"" is a good description. He has an unobtrusive monotone voice  so it's super easy to zone out during lectures. Don't panic if you don't get to al"
4.5,I love the class! He is very helpful and sending emails for each reading keeps me on my toes with the assignments. Tests...if studied for are very easy!
4,Boring as heck...nice guy though  easy grader
4.5,He has an extremely dry wit  so if you do  then you'll find him really interesting and funny. If you don't  you'll probably be bored to tears. But his courses are pretty easy  usually take home exams or essays. If you go to class and do your work nominally well  you should get at least a B.
4.5,Dr. Cawthorne is the bomb diggity of a teacher. She is extremely helpful and accommodating to those that are truly interested in learning. She cares about her studeents.
3.5,No Comments
5,Such a great teacher...if your not good in math do her extra credit it helps!!!
5,I really loved this class! It was a lot of fun  and Dr. Cawthorne is so sweet. She makes things clear and very easy to understand  even if you aren't the best math student. If for some reason you don't understand  she will do anything she can to help you .
5,Best teacher ever!! She makes the class very interesting. You can not fail that class.
5,She is a wonderful teacher  she is so cute and makes the class so much fun. If you can't understand her  then your crazy. She is sooo organized! & she has a wonderful smile!!!
1,i didn't like how he was very nosey with my studying and too much on my ass about how im gettin my work done. I paid 2 000dollars for that class and ended up withdrawing because of the way his teaching style was.
1,The benny lo's show!!! hahaha this class is absolutely amazing!! amazing bcoz u can get an A+ no sweat  just show up and listen to his dumb stories! he's cool but i'd rather study on my own than to show up for his class.
1,This professor was useless  absolutely useless  aced the midterm and final but got a B in class for being late  was justified  but not to him  nothing in the lecture involved any material relating to engineering till the final exam and only one question  thank god i graduated from DeVry (My high school is tougher than DeVry)
1,"This is the worst teacher I've had in my entire life. The work is all online so you can do it all from home. ""But what if I need to learn it in calss?"" Well don't bother  because he doesn't lecture. Just an absolutely horrible class."
1.5,Made us sit thru one of his CD recordings  a waste... Class was a waste  Ace'd the midterm and final  yet got a B grade due to the fact that I was always late about a half and hour  and class (Statistics for Engineering) did not have one single problem with the exception of the final  to due with engineering  a nice guy  but a real bore...
1,waste of money.. was not helpful at all
4,Very very very very easy class  but a complete waiste of money.
1,jerk.Not helpful at all. Don't waste your time & money.
1,Never seen such moran professor. He should dismiss from the shool.
2,scaryyyyyyyyyyyyyy

1,You can hardly understand him through his thick accent. He also taught Calculus but it was not beneficial to us engineers as he taught Business Calc. Bad Teacher! Avoid Him. Tests are easy  but I didn't learn anything and I got an A+!
4.5,Is all about proofs of theroms  does not grade exam solutions  but actual work -ALERT to ti89 users-. Actually grades HW  again if you cannot prove it  its wrong. Constantly reminds importance of math profiency in engineering. By far hardest professor yet. I was the sole student to pass the class of 15.
2,This professor does a very good job of writing examples on the board...mind that hes always standing in front of them  ...and writes them at lightning speed. be warned. professor gives no theory or background on subject. He never shows up to the lab  but can be found durring office hours. This was the most infuriating class that I ever took.
3,he's hard and goes very fast be prepared. YOu better study your stuff and I sudgest using the ASC tutoring center  even if just to study. Pay close attention and either take notes or find some one else who takes them and make copies. do pract. exams!!
3.5,Uh!
5,Incredibally difficult professor  however  his class cuts all of the slackers from the program. Most people take his class TWICE! But to pass  as I learned in my 2nd semester with him  just show up to class. Most test questions are from HW!
5,I disagree with the second comment. Pound for Pound  Prof Polk is the...THE BEST Professor at Devry Long Beach and Devry SoCal over all. His real world experience inspired me to start a business. I wasn't in his class at the time and he still helped me with my business plan...He's a great professor
4,He knows what he is talking about in regards to career development  but thinks too highly of himself.
1,"Terrible Professor. Goes into off topic sports analogies that don't relate to class. Makes you earn points with minutiatic exercises. Too high of standard  and none of the materials served us outside of class. Has an ""Society is against me"" comp"
5,It was great semester that I had so much fun to learn. Whenever I learned new concept  I applied to my job  which impressed my boss. Now I want to study accounting for my major.
1,She is very scattered and has a very hard time explaining the subject. She may be a good accountant at her job  but she is a very poor teacher. She assumes everyone is familiar with Accounting and that everyone is on the same page she is. She is very har
1,This Professor (supposedly) taught mechatronics to me  mechanical-electrical devices  according to the text and curriculum mainly involving controls related to ladder logic. All of the labs were recycled from previous courses and did not apply  questions often took weeks to get answers  and the lecture was completely off subject.
5,Awesome professor. He is very smart but he plays dumb with the students. He is very laid back and wants to help the students out. Take his class  you will have a joke of the day before he begins his lectures. A lot of fun  I miss being in his class.
5,Really great professor. Taking his class is one of the best things you can do at Devry. He challenges you ways besides just tests. He is not crazy hard  yet he does know what he he is talking about  and will get you excited about the subject matter.
5,The reason I came to this school. He actually TEACHES physics. Most teachers of science/math don't do it properly and are so useless that you could learn as much studying on you own in the same time. Best teacher I have ever seen for any technical subject and I have had 6 physics and umpteen math teacher in my life. He should be cloned.
5,Dr.teitell is a great guy. He makes you understand the material and that is his first priority. Exceptional knowledge he is a gift to Devry. yet some do a disservice to themselves by cheating  because he is not a stickler. one of the most valuable classes I have ever taken.
4.5,what to say about this professor does not stress students test are a joke very easy to easy I did not cheat but everyone else did good guy over all trys hard. he just dosent hold student accountable for there work
1,If you dont cheat your an idiot. cause everybody else does.
5,Not only is he easy  but he completely makes you understand the subject. One time my car broke down on the road and he fixed it for me. Knows his way through Windows and Linux systems. Incredible memory of C++ programming and data structures. Asset!
1.5,Johnston is the sort of teacher that probably should have retired twenty years ago. His classes are great if you want to listen to him complain about his personal life for an hour and a half  but if you actually want to learn something  you better find another teacher. He doesn't have clear grades and isn't very articulate either.
4,EXTREMELY easy if you take a survey class with him. We had one final that was take home open book and no homework. Fairly entertaining and down to earth as well.
5,It is a good class if one cares  People should not take advantage of a good teacher. (I know I have poor spelling skills)
4,Dennis is a wonderful professor  wouldn't you agree? I love how he sets up his methods classes for open discussion and felt that it as a good way of understanding the concepts as well as his and my peers views and in turn made me think about mhow I would use those concepts in my own teaching. I too also like Mastery learning making sure the concepts are learned correctly  like in conducting. That is a vital skill for all teachers and is best that it can be done over until it is done right. HARD and SHORT!
4,Dennis RULES! And  he's in love with me. Probably the most laid back teacher that actually gets kids to work and do a good job. How he does it is a mystery.
4.5,No Comments
3,Hes pretty cool. Hes classes are ok he goes on tangents  but hes a nice guy and you can pretty much do nothing in his classes.
5,one of my favs
3,watch out for those short shorts of his
5,Dennis is the best. He's a wonderful teacher and he truly cares about his students. He is always there when you need someone to talk to  cry to or get advice. St. Rose is lucky to have him.
5,Dennis is Dennis. Very helpful and always there to talk if you are having a bad day. All around hes a very caring professor and wants his students to succeed.
5,Dennis is a wonderful teacher! He is truely dedicated and makes learning an unforgettable experience. His approaches to things are great  and he is just downright hilarious! Dennis rocks!
5,there really is never a dull moment with dennis around! he not only teaches a class but he makes sure that you are LEARNING. some of the other NIMS profs. should follow his lead.
5,Dr. Johnston is an incredible teacher. He motivates his students to practice and study by being an honest  talented  down to earth person. All of my classmates agree that other teachers at St. Rose could benefit from following Dr. Johnston's lead.
1,phd or no phd  NOT A COMPETENT EDUCATOR  inappropriate comments  egocentric  plays favorites  full of himself  manipulative  all talk  boring.
4.5,there is never a dull moment when dennis is around!

2,I took Hartmann's class for introduction to human geography  and let me tell you he gets so off topic. His tests have almost nothing to do with what we learn in class  hence you must read the book. But overall he is very a easy grader when it comes to papers and tests  everyone got an A on our only paper of the semester.
5,Rudi is a very nice professor who is passionate about his work and cares about his students. You will be required to attend 2 out of 3 field trips. They get a little long but are actually pretty fun.
1.5,"He gives unclear lectures filled with off-topic interjections and ramblings. PPT slides directly copied from the textbook are used for ""lectures"". Boring classes with zero group projects  no creativity. I often walked out of class due to being so frustrated. I barely studied and still gots A's on all my papers and midterms. A total waste. Avoid!"
2,I can say very honestly that I learned nothing. He actually discussed what a cowboy is  what a cowgirl is  the fact that young woman love horses and really anything but geography. He was very scatter brained  unorganized and unclear. Three eight hour long field trips  so this should be more like a six credit course. Do not take his classes!
3,Took Rudi for Geography of Colorado. He's a really nice guy  but a little scattered in his lectures. He had required field trips  which I actually enjoyed. They may be prohibitive for some students as it required driving our own vehicles or carpooling far distances (NE Colorado and Vail valley.) Not my favorite professor  but informative enough.
4,He is extremely nice and very passionate about the subject but is all over the place. It is hard to know what to study when test time comes around.
1.5,Just read the powerpoint. So boring.
4,Good professor  interesting  and very easy class!
2.5,He is a pretty easy professor. Really funny at times. I enjoyed his class and his personality. The class is interesting and you need to just attend the lectures in order to pass his exams. I would recommend this class.
1.5,Nice guy  but not sure what he adds to his class. He uses the power points that the book gives to him  and then just reads off it. Sometimes he will use a transparency that he has written on  but his hand writing is completely not legible. His TA grades everything. His mid-term covered 4 of the biggest regions  and he broke it down to 12 questions.
4,Rudi is a great teacher! He knows what he is talking about and he is pretty amusing to listen to. I have taken 2 classes from him and have done very well. I recommend him to anyone wanting to take a geography class.
3.5,You can't not love this guy- loves teaching and is always willing to help you  has an old-man-endearing and innocent nature to him. always means well and works hard for his students. His class is interesting and not too challenging. I took world regional geography with him and enjoyed it.
4,Very good professor: kind  intelligent  informed  knowledgeable  and committed. This was a very enjoyable course. I would definitely recommend his courses.w

5,Jazz History was an awesome class! You don't need to know anything about music in order to get an A. He makes the class very interesting by bring his saxophone and allowing you to hear the differences between different types of Jazz. He only grades you on quizzes but he goes over every question the class before! Love this class and Paul!
3.5,Paul is very very very good at what he does. Very open and responsive to students. He was our dept. chair for 12 years  helped erect 2 multi-million dollar music buildings. And we love his Bill Cosby sweaters.

2.5,He's on leave for the semester  he was our department chair

4,Easy class but I flunked it. Easy guy  very informative and thorough with the notes...very very thorough. Please pay attention and read those books.. Failure to do both resulted in my failure of the class.
4,Don't bother buying the book  and be sure and be there to take notes every day and you will make A's on all of the tests. There are 2 books you will have to read but they are easy 100's if you read them. Just look over the notes before every test and you can easily make an A. Don't be afraid to ask questions  he's very helpful.
5,This guy is easy. If you take him you will get an A. There are two book (Additional reading) tests that you will get a 100 on and the other 3 regular tests are 50 questions multiple choice. There is a lot of note taking so bring a recorder.
4.5,go ahead and take this guy...all you do is take notes  so you better be there. He talks fast but the tests are pretty easy
4.5,his class was easy.as long as you go to class and take notes and are alive in class you can make an A in the class.The tests are easy as long as you look over your notes.Essays are easy too he tells you them before the test.The book tests are easy too as long as you read the book.
5,Easiest class ever. You take a lot of notes... from the minute he walks in the door till class is over... but thats all you need to pass his class. Don't even need the text book if you go to class you have it made. Lecture Test and bokk test are easy easy easy!!
5,SATTERWHITE CLASS IS VERY EASY. ALL YOU DO IS TAKE NOTES ALL CLASS. REALLY FROM THE TIME HE TAKES ATTENDANCE UNTIL IT IS TIME TO LEAVE. YOUR HAND WILL HURT WHEN YOU LEAVE. TEST ARE STRAIGHT FROM NOTES. BOOK TEST EVERYBODY GETS AN 100  JUST READ THE CLIFF NOTES. EASY CLASS I MADE AN A.
5,He is an a GREAT guy...TAKE THIS CLASS! Very informative and is always very clear on everything. Tests are not hard if you take the notes. =)
4.5,Good proffessor. Straightforward on all tests  just take LOTS of notes. Book tests are EASY. If you take notes you don't really need the book.
4.5,what a complete blowoff class. so easy  just pay attention and take some notes and you will get an A.
5,I had him at angelina. His first name is Dextor :) . His classes are easy. Just write down what he says. I made A's in both of his classes.
5,awesome teacher  very helpful  study the notes  you don't even have to buy the book.
4,Just write down every word that comes out of the man's mouth. Don't bother with the book
4.5,A very knowledgable teacher. Tests are very easy if you just ready through the notes. you have to read two books for this class but even if you just read sparts of them you will most likely make a 100 on the tests. I highly suggest him!!!
3,we take lots of notes but very easy tests. 2 book test that are almost guaranteed 100s
5,Way cool guy  boring lectures  but the material is easily understood  if you have questions ask  if you didnt catch something he said ask him to repeat it  he is extremely nice and a great teacher
5,In this class  you take tons of notes each time. A recorder or a laptop will be very helpful.
4,Not a bad class to sleep through
3.5,Dexter talks out of this notebook the whole time (not exagerating)..he goes right up to the minute  never letting us out early. You take tons of notes  HOWEVER...tests are way easy and straight from notes. The book tests are easy ways to get 100%.
4,satterwhile was an extremely easy professor...although he was rather boring  you can do things to keep yourself entertained in his monotonous lectures...the class is so easy  as is the material..i took him as a junior in hs  and i had As both times.
3,Dennis and this class helped expand my interest in reading and understanding contemporary theatre. Certain projects could have been more thoughtfully assigned and graded.
3.5,He gave clear instructions  but his grading criteria was not as concise. Good marks for actual classroom instruction  poor marks for time management and sensitive/specific grading.
5,I have read with utter disappointment the shallow  misguided  ignorant rants against one of the best teachers I ever had (and I studied with some big names). He prepared me for a successful career  earns the respect of seasoned professionals  and his shows are among the best  and he has help shape some of the best-they come back to work with him!
4,Dennis is nice and means well  but is iffy as actor and director. He does teach you some things  but he has very jaded opinions that he presents as gospel (so you kind of have to predict those weird opinions and make theatre that fits them by sheer luck to get support in class). He's out of touch with the field which is his biggest problem.
1,Mr. Razze is a funny little man he is a nice guy not much of a professor. He was directing when I graduated in 1999 and his productions are not really good. His class TR 222 is interesting and comes in handy when I play trivial pursuit however  none of this is practical. He is a really nice guy just not a good professor and even worse actor
1,The class was uninteresting  he was frequently incorrect and I didn't so much care for his humor.
1,Is not clear as to what he says. Wouldn't know the topic without his notes  which are frequently incorrect.
2,Sometimes  I would love to get inside the little man's brain to see what goes on  but then I realize that A. it would drive me insane or B. I would get lost and wouldn't be able to get back out again and C. it really isn't that worth it.
1,Dennis is a nice person deep down  but has no place teaching at DeSales. His productions are not art  they are movies on stage. He has a horrible work ethic and does not know what professional theatre is like today. He can talk all about how things were hu
4,Knows his stuff when it comes to History of the theatre. Also very thorough in teaching directors what to consider when taking on a play.
1.5,No Comments
3,Deep down  I know that Dennis is a good guy. Just a little misguided. His classes were BORING though. You don't really need to pay attention to pass  though. RUNNER UP 3 YEARS STRONG! YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS
1.5,I like him as a friend but as a director/ teacher he sucks ass and has no tact. But he is a sweet man who thinks of his students as his children when he's not directing them. The YELLOW JACKET IS MINE!!!
3.5,the yellow jacket
4.5,don't buy the book! you don't need it. take good notes and save about $180!

5,RICKY!!!!!!!!!! we miss u!! you need to come back!!!!! pretty pleeeease
5,COME BACK!
5,Nice guy. Really cares about his students. Wants students to succeed. Easy to talk to.
4,Dr. Polin is one of the remaining few professors of education I know who actually give real grades. She expects her students to work and think. She is an amazing mentor to those who show up to learn. She is a nightmare for those who show up to get by.
3.5,Linda has a caustic sense of humor. Sensitive folks tend to dislike her. She speaks about highly academic subjects in irreverent ways but really knows her literature. If you get over the initial slight  and press her  she shows extreme interest in your success and learning. What more can you ask for?
1,Linda is very disorganized & hard to follow. Her teaching methods leave much to be desired. She won't help students she dislikes. She openly harasses students of certain minority ethnicities  and does whatever she can to thin their ranks and keep their achievement low. Tread carefully. She nearly turned my educational experience into a nightmare.
3,Her organization skills leave a bit to be desired. She presents interesting content  though.
2,You must fit within her agenda.

4.5,Presented the subject matter whith great familiarity and a unique sense of style. Fun  down to earth and approachable.
5,Lisa's one of the most dynamic personalities I've ever encountered. She makes a very dry subject entertaining  and I learned a lot from her. If they don't offer her tenure  Brandeis will lose a real gem.
2.5,I didn't sleep well before her class- she likes to make you feel stupid.
3,"I agree with the ""chip on the shoulder"" comment. She is abrasive and derives joy from making people uncomfortable. Also  she is biased toward the girls by taking passes late for them and not for the guys...NOT COOL."

5,He is amazing! I have taken two classes with him. He sometimes has paper assignments but they're not difficult. It is more of your opinion on the matter being discussed in class. You learn so much! I decided on minoring in Chicano Studies after taking him my first year.
5,Helpful  clear. Allows you a good amount of freedom in his papers.
5,Class material very interesting and relevant. Very approachable professor. Very encouraging and nurturing environment. Readings and assignments are not overwhelming. It helps to have an interest in the topics covered to really get the most out of the class. Highly recommended professor.
5,This is the first time I even write about a professor but I had to write about him. I took his class in the 1990's and he is one professor who I still fondly remember. He truly is there to help you get through your courses and give you a and along the way. I truly do wish there were more just like him...gracias professor. All my best to you.
1.5,I thought he was a Chicano studies professor. I think he should stay there. He doesn't know enough about history to be teaching it.
5,Best Professor! he's so helpful  knows his material  makes class fun and project fun. He's not hard at all and his lectures are great! you will learn from him. Easy A...
5,AWESOME PROFESSOR!!!!!!! you will learn in this class and you well love his class. midterms and finals are take homes
5,Great teacher! 4 papers  all take home
5,Very helpful and quite respectful to every student. Very clear and concise rubrics. Gives plenty of time for each assignment. Mixes various forms of instruction to teach his classes.
4.5,He is a nice professor and its a very easy class
5,"Great teacher  I wish he thought Hist 450  bc his class was really easy and informative. I got an ""A"" and those only come every other blue moon  so it must mean he is doing something right. You will not regret it at all.Take home midterm and final. lots of videos. lots of free time. BUT YOU STILL LEARN A LOT"
5,THIS PROFESSOR IS SOOOO NICE AND HELPFUL. HE TELLS YOU WHAT IS EXPECTED OF YOU  AND ALSO HIS MIDTERM AND FINAL ARE BOTH TAKE HOME ESSAYS. JUST PAY ATTENTION AND DO THE WORK AND YOU WILL PASS.
5,Great class good professor the class is not hard at all..He is a very understanding person :) He shows alot of interesting documentaries that will be useful during final.. Keep up with class discussions and read a bit from the book and you'll do good.
4.5,He is a great teacher! I enjoyed going to class and listening to what he had to say. He is an easy teacher if you do the work.
5,I don't understand all the negative comments. I think it's great we have a Mexican nationalist teaching in a US public school. There's something in that for everyone. For example  I learned a lot about the teaching priorities of Mexican nationalists AND what a great country this is that we allow such people to teach here.
1,Just do everyone (including yourself) a favor and retire already.
4.5,Easy teacher and very helpful. He gives you points for attendance along with point for group discussions  which occur pretty much every class meeting. His office is alwayas open if you need to speak with.
5,The Man of the hour! Pleasure to have this teacher. I was on the soccer team I missed a few times and still passed with a B. You can write about what evers in the essays. He likes for you to use samples from the book. Very easy and flexible on the hours. Emails right back and overall the one to take HONESTLY!! Plus makes class a bit fun.
1,how many yawns does it take to fill up one of his classes? I always fell aslpeep before finding the answer.
5,Lectures  videos and readings are all useful for the midterm and final papers  the more you use them in the papers the better your grade. The family report paper is kind of like a research paper but more based on comparing two generations  hassle to do yet Balderrama guides through the process. The family paper its 10-12 pgs long so dont procrastin
5,I enjoyed taking Theory 4 with Dr. Roter as he was very clear about what he wanted in each paper  had a mini-lecture about each piece in class  and was very timely about returning papers and grades. As long as you take notes and are in class  you will be able to keep up with the workload. I highly recommend taking this course with Roter.
1.5,I lasted two days in Roter's Ear Training 3 before I switched. Not only was he extremely unclear  but he also made me feel very uncomfortable when I asked if I could test out of his class. Depending on the mind you have  ear training is either very easy or very difficult. He hates students with absolute pitch  but many others fail his class.
1,Dr. Roter goes through material so fast your hands will be on fire. Sometimes he doesn't go through the terms we need to know and expects us to know when the test comes up. His matching section in tests are vague so the only way is to take a guess. Unreasonable when the answer I gave was correct but wanted something else deduct it.
1,Worst teacher in my opinion.
3.5,He's tough  but he knows his stuff. But you need to let him know if you're struggling. If you don't  you're gonna fall behind. Tough grader  if you have one blemish on a chord identification  that's 5 points off of the quiz  it adds up. Study  and you'll make it.
5,take music theory with Dr. Roter. He is a great teacher and as long as you pay attention in class you will do fine! He keeps the class interesting and you will learn A LOT.
5,Awesome teacher. He's the type of teacher you will remember for the rest of your life.
5,Take theory 3 with him!
4.5,4 words. What Would Roter Do? (WWRD)
5,I have him for graduate classes and had him for undergrad and every week I learn more and more in a very fun learning environment which helps the hard material! Great teacher overall- had him for theory IV  orchestration  and now form and analysis.
5,Great teacher. He has a quirky sense of humor that's just subtle enough to slide by half the class at 8 AM while the other half has a ever-present half smile on their face. You never know what he's going to say next  but it's always entertaining. He's also very good at finding new ways to communicate new ideas to help everyone learn better.
1,Class is not applicable to what we as teachers need to know and should be offered as an elective rather than a requirement for degree. Rarely will a teacher need to instruct on how to analyze atonal music to an elementary  middle  or even a high school student(unless it is a college level course which is RARE in a typical classroom setting)

5,I love Dr. Roter. He's funny and expects the very best from everyone and is a very active believe in us living up to our full potential.
4,I hated him for dictation  but then we got along in theory i would always make comments just to rile him up and now i love him hahah hes just funny and a really smart guy!!
5,I find Roter strangely sexy  and I don't know why! Maybe I am attracted to his intelligence?
4.5,Dr. Roter is extremely intelligent and has an intense grasp of the musical world backed up with a great passion for music. He also has a good sense of humor (although nerdy at times) and sets a high standard that encouraged me to do my best. Very interesting classes.
5,Dr. Roter has a great sense of humor that he incorporates into his teaching. He gives an a properly balanced class of learning and smiles. He's great.
5,outstanding professor. Wants his students to learn and experience the subject  hard as all get out but you'll be ready for anything after him!
3,Fabulous professor. Be prepared.
4.5,Possibly the 2 hardest classes  but Lewis is so good  it's worth putting in the extra time and work. You'll be prepared for the bar if you take her class.

5,Don't drive a Cadillac through the forest and you will be fine... 
3.5,He's a great teacher. His assignments build on each other  so make sure you understand as you go- and start the assignments the day they're assigned! My first C was in his class  and I changed my major to business. But he's good for Computer Science majors  if you don't want an easy course.
5,Great proffessor and treats all students the same
2.5,Very good at teaching and making you practice.
4.5,On of the Greatest Professor in this Department. I enrolled in every class he taught  because it is a guarantee that you will learn. He does give a lot of work and all his classes are a challenge.
5,good ole BR^2. My favorite instructor by far.
4,Dr. Rimes is the best lecturer in the department. He's a good guy to talk to during office hours as well. The only concerns I have with him as a teacher is that sometimes his assignments are unclear  and he seems a little disorganized with his paperwork (your HW and tests)
5,No Comments
4,I liked him  thought he was an excellent teacher. At first I found him slightly unapproachable  but after I had to go to him for help he was great and helped me out. Just don't get behind in class.
4,Dr. Rimes is an excellent professor. He follows a simple philosophy of jumping right into the subject matter. This teaching method provides for a better overall learning experience.
5,Exceptional professor  exceptional person. Always excited to be in class. Cares about students. Very easy on the eyes!
4,I took a variety of classes from Doc Robinson when I attended EMU  including inter-racial comm. (I'm a white chick). If you have issues re: feeling uncomfortable because you're white due to his class  maybe you should check yourself. As far as coursework  I felt it was challenging  yet fair. And Doc Robinson was always available for appointments.

1.5,he is an absolutely terrible teacher. do not take him.
1.5,Good new guys!! I heard he's retiring! He is boring and useless. He has cancelled class about 6 times and does NOT notify us  I'm a commuter and he is not considerate at all to his students.
1,he is literally the worst teacher i've ever had... in my entire life.
1,I have never hated a class so much. The professor is totally useless. I agree with everyone else and their negitive comments. Forget about asking for help. If you have a choice don't take this class with him!
2,I would NOT recommend him. He is easy  gives easy assignments and grades pretty easy but you will not learn a thing. We talked about prejudice and stereotypes all semseter. He has you do the work for him a lot of the time. You work a lot in groups which is pointless for that class. He is unorganized  unclear  and boring.
1,Um...Did someone say Retirement? Because thats exactly what he needs to do. I'm sure he use to be a great professor. He doesn't explain anything. Needs to realize somethings just can be elaborated on. Class has potential. Discussions were OK.But overall I think its probably my worst class yet here at EMU.Be weary of this class if you dare take it.
1,says you can only be a **** if you are white  pretty much hates on white people all class. whole class based on white/black  no variety. not helpful  grades unfairly  ridiculous assignments  wont check or respond to email  unorganized- he lost my term paper. THIS MAN IS BIASED AND ****! STAY AWAY!
4.5,By far  this is the most wonderful teacher i have ever had. He is caring  funny  sweet  helpful  everything. Yes  he may not be clear about some assignments  but he is willing to help out the best he can. This professor puts a smile on my face everyday. I would recomend him to everyone
1,I HAD THE WORSE EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PROFESSOR OUT OF ALL OF MY COMMUNICATION PROFESSORS. HE DOESN'T EXPLAIN HIS MATERIAL AND IS VERY UNCLEAR ON EVERY SUBJECT...I WISH I HAD KNOWN ABOUT THIS SITE BEFORE I TOOK HIM BECAUSE HE IS THE WORSE. AND TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY HE HAS THE NERVE TO MAKE US WRIT IN APA STYLE AND HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT IS.I
2,This guy litterally borders on racism. The entire semester  we talked about stereotypes  and I kept leaving class feeling like a lot of what I heard was how evil I am because I'm white. Further  he refuses to fully explain his assignments and he really doesn't explain anything very well at all.
1,Very easy  but also very boring. Class was based around stereotypes for the entire semester  it gets old after a while. Case studies are also pointless  take it with someone else if you plan on getting something out of the class.
2.5,what the heck was the point in me taking it?? He is boring  and the material was pointless.
1,Worst teacher I ever had. I'm in Grad school out of state but found this site and thought I should share this with everyone. I got an A  but it still wasn't worth it.
1,I found him to be both uninterested in his students and in the subject matter. He spent the entire semester reiterating the same exact communications theories every other com. class at EMU teaches with nothing new or even remotely insightful to add. Doc Robinson xe2x80x9clecturesxe2x80x9d on the dangers of dogmatic thinking  intolerance  and ethnocentrism yet  I have found him to be one of the most dogmatic  preachy  intolerant  and close-minded professors I have ever had.
5,good teacher inter racial is a fun class
4.5,OMG  his classes are SO not hard. Just do the reading  people  and take notes  then memorize his defs  the pts. of certain concepts  etc. He doesn't like slacker students so don't take him if you don't give a sh*t.
4,At first I thought he would be hard and he seemed hard to understand. As class progressed though  its very easy to understand what he wants. He wants for his students to express what they are reading and learning from his class.As long as you appear to be mindful of others  you will have no problem.
3.5,He was a good prof--Communications is a **** major--so stop your whining
5,Loved her as a clinical instructor. Classroom was wonderful. She made everything interesting and soooooo clear!
5,Great teacher and sshe's my favorite aunt!!!
3,His language courses are extremely tough and I have seen students cry during the oral exams. He is very caring with those he believes to be making an effort but he is harsh on others. Don't take his class if you want to focus on your core courses. Hardest course I've taken and I may fail it....
4,Avdulov is one of the most caring profs at SMU. He legitimately cared about your grades  your attendance and your happiness in class. But  his class is difficult. Extremely difficult. Required an immense amount of dedication  time and effort. His grading scheme is vague. Thought I failed until I saw my grade. VERY stressful!!
3.5,He is visibly enthusiastic about the content he teaches which always makes class enjoyable. He brings in people multiple times during the semester to teach us first hand about Japanese Culture which was really interesting and broke up the lecturing... The only thing I hated was the mandatory book we had to read. So boring  confusing and tedious!
5,Avdulov-Sensei will change your life. His classes are rigorous  although not necessarily difficult to do well in. Dedication and attendance are mandatory  however if you put forth the effort he will make sure you get an A in his course. He is both professional  and enthusiastic  and integrates both Japanese culture and language into his lessons.
5,Took this class & language with him  again saw two sides. I recommend this to everyone its very light  fun  he's an amazing person and professor and is very passionate about Japanese language and culture. If you took Japanese with him but not this don't be afraid of this he's like a totally different prof in this class then what he is in JPNS 1100.
3,I've seen two sides of him. He is very passionate about Japanese culture and language as am I. However  as a language professor his course is very rigorous and demanding. requires a large time dedication regardless of your willingness to learn the language and this may interfere with other courses if you're taking this as an elective. I'm doing BSc
5,I am not sure why some people did not like him. He is a fantastic teacher who knows alot about traditional Japanese culture. He is strict but very nice and helpful. Got an A- and I am happy with that.
5,Absolutely phenomenal professor. He is extremely passionate about what he teaches  and is dedicated to helping you receive the best mark possible. That being said  do not expect a bird course by any means. Quizzes are frequent and rigorous  and you can expect to be diving into Kanji by the end of your first semester.
5,"Avdulov is a fantastic professor. If you put in the effort and are dedicated to improving  he will do anything to help you reach your goals. However  if you skip classes or slack off  you will get no love from him (those who left comments about ""rudeness"" were likely in this category). Work hard and take it seriously  and class will be great!"
3.5,Don't expect a bird course from him. Pay attention when he says something will be on the test  write down everything that sounds like a key term  and take an interest in the course
5,Best prof I've had so far in my studies. He takes genuine interest in his students success the likes of which I've never seen. He will move mountains to help a student learn the language  if that student is genuinely interested. If they aren't  then there's nothing he can do for them. HIGHLY suggest Avdulov sensei if you want to learn the language.
5,Avdulov is the BEST! If you're ready for the challenge of learning a new language  take him! His teaching style is awesome  and he's SUPER helpful. If you really try hard and he sees that  he'll love you. If you do bad on a test  he'll let you retake it. It'll be basically the exact same so you can ace it. Definitely the best prof for Japanese!
4,Good professor  pay attention to the terms and phrases covered in class (some in Japanese) because they'll be on the test! Very helpful and personable.
4.5,To the person who said he's rude and not a good prof  you're wrong! Sure he doesn't have patience for the people who don't try and are forever behind but that's THEIR fault! Not his! If you actually want to learn the language TAKE HIM! He's very nice  funny  and helpful if you try and he'll make sure you learn. He really loves what he teaches.
1,I'm amazed at the good comments. I had him a few years ago and he was horrible. Rude to the students and just a huge jerk. I would never  EVER  take another class with him again. EVER.
4.5,I'd recommend taking Japanese from Avdulov if you are actually interested in learning the language and are willing to put in the time and effort that requires. His classes are always fun and interesting  and if you work hard you will learn a lot. He's honest  and if you do poorly  he'll let you know.
5,Well he is the best I think. Language is a thing that you have to work hard  and he well helps to do it.
5,He's a wonderful prof
5,This guy is the****. This guy made taking Japanese more than just an anime thing. He is great as a person and very interesting. his stories are hilarious. If it was any other prof i dont think i would like going to university if it wasnt for this course. But take his class only if your serious he wont sugar coat things.
5,Too many anime morons take this course & complain. Wake up  people. Learning Japanese isn't a blue-haired adventure full of chibi eyes and giggles. It's a lot of hard work. Avdulov is a challenging prof. who's always honest with you about Japan and your work. Work hard & don't waste his time and he'll help you in every way possible. Ganbatte.
4,Really cares about his students and makes sure you know all the time that he is willing to listen during the class and after the semester is over. He says he won't hold attendance against you if it's 2 or less classes  but he does. Class is work heavy at the end  just reading through the whole class and then all the assignments are due at end
3,attendance required. expects participation.
5,Outstanding professor. He truly cares about the students and really makes the class interesting. The assignments are fairly graded and make you think about the material in an interesting manner. I would highly recommend one of his classes to anyone.
5,This is perhaps the most relevant class I took during the MBA program. He wants you to participate in the class so make sure you do. The workload was reasonable. The classes were enjoyable and he makes learning the material fun
5,Nice guy. Hardass on participation and attendance but gives good quiz notes and prepares you well for projects.
5,Took him a couple of years ago when I was doing my MBA for Strategy of the Firm or something like that. Great teacher
3.5,Plays favorite so just ask him to the bar or stuff like that. Also  if you're a hot girl = easy A.
4.5,great class  great prof. make sure you participate b/c he's big on that. suck up and you'll get an A! if you're not a talker then this class is NOT for you
5,Awesome teacher. Very interesting class. No tests except a take home final. Weekly quizzes but they are straight from the notes.
4.5,good teacher  nice guy  and fairly interesting
5,Good lectures and is willing to help if you need it. One of the best professors you'll find at Loyola! Good professors are hard to find at this school.
5,Giampetro is the sweetest professor at Loyola  and her class is probably the best I've taken. She makes the material so interesting and relevant. There is a bit of homework but nothing too challenging  you'll need the test for the hw but you could split with friends in the class. Tests are right from class work  not too difficult.
5,Literally the best professor I've ever had
5,One of my favorite classes at Loyola. She is the sweetest professor and she really cares about you. She is always there for you if you need help in her class. This class is not the easiest  but it is do-able and go to office hours. do all the homework and you will do good on the test. Preparing for the class is how you will get an A in this class.
5,Awesome teacher. Always comes into class fully prepared and happy to teach. She gives you weeks ahead of time so you can organize yourself early on. She has a lot of connections and experience in law so it would be wise to be friendly with her in hopes she can help you out in the future. Take this class  enjoy it  and receive an easy A.
5,She is the sweetest woman on campus. Cares so much about the students and preparing them for success in the class and in the real world. Weekly reading assignments and quizzes. Questions are given with the reading and if you answer them you will do fine on the quiz. Two midterms and a final all open note so take good notes. Final optional.
5,God  I love her. Tests are very open-ended and she assigns mini tests before class to give you the main points of the reading. She ran the class so brilliantly that the three hour class went by very quickly. Awesome grading system  easy A  very helpful.
4.5,Great teacher  flexible with due dates  and make up assignments also. Willing to help
4.5,Great teacher. Really connects with the class and makes any topic enjoyable. Does require some work here and there  but it is worth it to have her as a professor. Just do your work and go to class and you will get an A.
5,Giampetro is the best professor at Loyola. Our class met on Saturdays  but she made it fun. She is hilariouis. For the most part  the couse material is interesting. I highly recommend her.
5,One of the top professors at Loyola. Made a subject I had no interest in at all fun and interesting. Challenged me to change my way of thinking  and was pretty successful in making me see other perspectives. Outstanding!
5,Great professor  enjoyed every class.
5,Absolutely the most honest  straight-forward prof I've ever had. Understands the whole work/life balance thing for adult learners. Great prof. You'll love her.
5,Prof. Giamptro is very sweet and personable- as far as the class she really likes to cover all perspectives and is not bias at all... she is very student-centered and she teaches in hope that you succede. The course load is relatively easy  she looks for insight and use of text in papers- no tests.. also a very helpful advisor
5,Professor Giampetro is honestly the sweetest lady ever. She gives a reasonable workload and is constantly there to help you. Don't listen to people that say she pushes propaganda and is bias - she lets everyone in the class say what they feel and is willing to listen to all opinions. TAKE HER IF YOU CAN. You won't regret it.
5,Professor Giampetro is the one of the top two professors at Loyola! She makes the class fun to learn  and makes the entire class excited for each and every class. She also has an understanding that most graduate students are busy outside of the classroom. Also great feedback!
5,Professor Giampetro is a great professor! She has real life experience she brings to the classroom combined with respect for her students as individuals. She is cognizant and flexible when it comes to the work/life/school balance and work-load is reasonable yet challenging.
5,She is one of the best professors I ever had. She makes the material fun to learn and makes you want to come to class. The workload is reasonable and she understands the work/life/school balance
5,"I had her for the ""glass ceiling"" course. I found her very well organized and she selected good readings. She did not push her ideas on you but rather had you think about the subject matter and make your own decisions. I would highly recommend this elective"
2.5,She's an academic with no real personal experience in any of these issues. If you want an easy grade  and work is paying anyway  why not?
2,She is not a teacher...she is a propaganda pusher...and a manipulator. Liberals and psycho-chicks/feminists will love her...non-liberals and non-psycho-chicks/feminists should drop her class ASAP...for good reason...because she is not a teacher...and your tution money is being wasted. She should be forcibly removed from the school (this is a Jesuit institution  not College Park).
4,HORRIBLE class! night class and he kept us the whole 3 hours everytime. Class was boring. could get done in 1 hour what we did in 3. Must go to every class  takes attendence and partipation. Quizes every week. 1 final project- most of grade. group work during class makes it more liveable. Has a really bad underbite. felt like a driver ed class.
5,Keeps the classes interesting. Even plays games with the class. Very friendly and likes being a teacher. Too bad most professors at Loyola aren't anywhere near as good.
3,No Comments
2.5,Humorous and amusing in class. Very difficult to work with outside of the classroom and does not offer additional support or assistance. Grading appears subjective as there is no rubric  and little constructive feedback on assignments.
3.5,Pat is one of the most amazing and approachable professors @ WFU
4.5,Nice guy. Made class interesting. Pay attention to the small tidbits & asides as he finds a way to include them on the exams.
4,Good professor. Went a little fast at times which was hard for us non=computer people but all in all a good class. WAY better than Quant 1!!!
5,Great teacher. Great class. Great tools.
3,I've heard this guy sucks via email but since I never tried I can't comment on that. He told us he was brief  though-almost as to forewarn us. I though he went out of his way to help us understand this stuff actually. We had extra tutorial sessions that he absolutely didn't have to do--but did. The final was tough but 4 the semester he was fine
1,Turned what could have been a great course into a trainwreck. Two-Faced  refused to answer students questions in class! At $300 a student hour he should be ashamed!
4,CB demos were very helpful. His lectures were a little dry. His grading was way too tough for a 1.5 credit graduate class. He treated us like high school students.
2,"Nice guy  but class amounts to nothing more than long drawn-out Crystal Ball demo's. He messes with the lighting in class constantly during these. Also he has different expectations for ""performance levels"" between his quizzes and tests - a tidbit he will not mention to you until after the fact."
2,Two personalities  a friendly face in class and nasty and mean comments through e-mail.
2,No Comments
5,I just wish we would stop talking about Rennie Stennet. Otherwise  he's OK and he smells good too.
5,Mr. Bradshaw keeps things interesting  thats for sure! Could go into a little more detail in lectures  but he knows what he's talking about (possibly hundreds of years of experience)  and is one funny man. A great guy and a good prof overall.
5,Well  what else can be said? How can you add to perfection? One of the best professors I've ever had. Be prepared to work hard for your grade  they're not handed to you on a plate for his class! He should be teaching more classes and clinicals as his knowledge of nursing is precise and endless. Other tutors should take a leaf out of his book.
5,Great sense of humor  keeps me awake while going through sometimes boring content. Also  wonderful nursing anecdotes that show the humane side of the profession. A very likeable and intelligent person and a great teacher.
4.5,Really super guy  great personality and made boring stuff really meaningful. Puts up with too much crap from noisy  disrespectful students  needs to crack the whip more on the idiots.

3,ok teacher
2.5,No Comments
4,Hes a very intelligent man and he knows his stuff. He will push you but as long as you stick with it then you will pass. The way he teaches will prepare you for graduate school. Make sure you do your best and dont procrastinate. Remember  your degree is no free ride. Dont take anything he assigns for granted and you will be ok.
5,Weber is a freaking amazing teacher did his Layers of Rome Trip  thought it was going to be a party. You go over there to learn! I learned more in one month with him than any other professor. He's a tough grader  expects a lot from you and is truly one hell of a teacher. If you want to learn  take this class if you want an easy A keep walking.
3,You can get an easy B  if you read and complete the assignments on time and completely. He's a hard grader and the professor will grade based on how well you understood the readings and subjects for that designated assignment.
1,He expects your to log in at different times to the discussion blog and reply to at least 3 peers with a minimum of 300 words. He doesn't even grade most of the things  he has his TA grade  Nancy. She is a freaking hard grader she does not cut any slack. Also  he assigns a homework assignment every week due on Tuesday at 10:50p.m. Don't get him!
1.5,I'm a senior set to graduate in the winter of 2016. The first time I took HUMM 3301 I received an F. The closer I got to graduation the more I wanted to retake the course in order to get rid of that F. So I decided to register for the online version of the course. Biggest mistake of my life. I've never been more stressed out over a course.
1.5,Worst class I have ever taken. He is condescending and not easy to work with. In the online class  he calls out your discussion points in red that do not align with his philosophy and makes you feel like dirt when asking for help. I wonder if he even likes doing his job.- pompous and grumpy. Stay away from this class if you can!
1,I felt so discouraged after this class!! I always thought when things are a myth there is no right or wrong answer  sorry but to him there is only his RIGHT!!
1,1 of the most frustrating experiences in my academic career.r Lectures/study guides seem slight or opaque in regards to the assignments  which were disjointed in regards goals  if we were able to discern them.r Feedback was critical w/o being constructive  & often irrelevant or inane.
1,Not quite sure how what he does is considered teaching. More like unencouraging. Terrible.
1,Worst teacher I have ever experienced. He rarely gets off his high horse to actually help students learn his views  which are a must. And if you prefer thinking outside the box  good luck because he doesn't allow it. There were several email threads over the semester with complaints about his attitude and teaching style. Avoid at all costs.
1,i wish i had know about his online course before taking it. the worst experience ever!!!!!!!
1,This class was horrible online and I would not recommend it to anyone. No lessons tough with a very freestyle type of teaching style. There were several student complaints during the semester about instructions given.
1.5,"Do not take this class online  hie pretentiousness is unbearable and he rarely provides feedback to help you understand so you can develop as a student. His lectures are unclear on the. Blackboard software and you'll never ""get"" where you are supposed to go with your comments because of this. I'm senior with a 3.85 GPA  just don't do it."
2,Teaching via the Socratic Method is BS in a Greek Literature class! I don't like teaching myself.
4.5,Weber is a GREAT teacher. The class is a bit difficult  but if you read and don't have a terrible group  you should do well. Weber is great at keeping you interested and probably the best teachers I've had.
4.5,"He is a good teacher. In the beginning of the semester he will break the class up into groups. If your group sucks your grade could go down a couple of points. READ READ READ  that is the only way to get a good grade. And make sure that you do the quizzes those are easy ""a's"". And at the end attendence is added to extra credit."
5,I think that Weber is the BEST professor that I have EVER had. Of course keeping up with the readings is vital to your grade (goes without saying)  but he is the BEST professor you can ever take! He is an inspiration!
4.5,He helps you keep up with the reading tasks by giving you quizzes. He sets up the class in groups  and that works out great. At first he annoyed me  but later in semester I came to understand what a good teacher he is. If you are new to college responsiblities  he will be challenging. He prepared me for future college demands  and I learned the value of studying in daily increments (instead of cramming/procrastination.)
5,I had him in 1990  then transferred to UT-Austin. I had great profs at UT-Austin  but Weber is still my all time favorite and most memorable. He is truly inspiring!
5,The class is hard if you don't read!!!!! That's pretty much it  if you are interested in learning (which is why you should be in college) then you'll enjoy him. I also went to the Rome trip with him  same work load. He's worth the time and $$$.
4.5,Great teacher. Taught very well. Was always willing to help if you had questions. His tests are appropriate for the course and doesn't pick ridiculous problems. You are fine as long as you do the homework. One of my top math teachers.
4,Homework isn't mandatory  which is nice. Does a lot of examples on the board  but makes a lot of mistakes. Is NOT a fair grader  taking off more points than necessary for small mistakes (especially considering how often he messes up on the board). Overall  he is a nice guy  though  and i would definitely take a class with him again.
5,This teacher was excellent! He was always ready for questions on the homework  and even encouraged them. He helped to the best of his ability  and truly cared for the knowledge that he gave his students. I hated math from previous teachers  but I liked it in his class. Anyone wanting to take Calculus should definitely consider taken Dr. Kern.
5,Kern explains everything very clearly and is always available for help. He is quickly responsive to any email questions and keeps the class updated on any questions/answers via email. It is evident that he cares about the success of his students. Very approachable and kind. Very lenient grader w/extra credit available if needed. Highly recommended.
5,Great Teacher!!! I found that he was extremely helpful and welcoming to any who came to his office for help. He also helped us to better understand careers in mathematics. Easy grader and offers easy extra credit problems.
5,Excellent teacher. Difficult subject but he is genuinely interested in seeing students succeed. Taken both CalcIII and Diff Eq. with him. Curves tests and usually offers some form of extra credit.
4.5,I thought  based on our homework  that the tests were going to be really hard. They weren't. At all. Even though I had to drop the class (too many other classes) I've stayed to take notes and learn the material. He's even given me copies of tests that he's given this semester. Over all  good teacher. 2nd best math teacher I've ever had.
5,Makes a difficult subject into something understandable. Always willing to spend time to help those confused.
5,doesn't assign too much homework but tests are fairly hard ( of course )
4,Always well prepared for classes  course material was easy. Nothing but matrices and everything you do with them amounts to arithmetic and high school algebra. Pretty good teacher  if you listen and take notes there's little need for extraneous studying. Tests/quizzes are easy  mostly computational.
3.5,cool guy good teacher
1,His second year after getting his PHD and has no clue how to teach upper division course. If you try to see him in his office hours  he gets pset and keep looking at his watch so you would feel bad and leave. He has no clue to do his own homework that he expect you to do. Avoid him at all cost.
2,Daniel Kern covers all the material on a basic level  and though there is more he could say on the material  he doesn't  instead slowing the class down with long  ambivalent pauses. You don't learn much  and end up having a hard time with hard material
4.5,Great prof  however he is a stickler for marking. This was however  an english course so I can hardly blame him. Over all he was extremely helpful  and kept every class interesting.
4.5,He is helpful  but picky when it comes to marking. Tries to keep class interesting. Overall  he was a great teacher and I enjoyed his class.
4.5,An online General Elective about an introduction to Slavery. Interesting to speak with in person and helpful on writing my final paper  showed real interest in the subject and managed to teach effectively through an online system.
3.5,really hard marker!
1,He will eventually be a great teacher  but for now he needs a little nore experience
3,he is pretty strict excellent lecturer tho very into it hes sexy also hehe
4.5,Cant argue with a class where watching tv is given as home work. makes u think more which could be good and bad.
5,Tony is the****!
4,Awesome professor  Good Sense of Humour  Just a nice guy in general!
2.5,He's too by the book and makes very rare exceptions. He's arrogant too sometimes.
5,Dave is the amazing  I love this man! I had him in my second semester of Fanshawe  and he really cares about his students. He encouraged me to go to university and I did and love it. He is a great man  gives you lots of chances to get marks! Criminal Justice with him was one of the best classes I have ever taken!
5,Dave is a great teacher really got me into the subject of criminal justice and wanting to learn all i could.
4,Nicest man in the world  but wont listen to what you say if you don't have a reliable source. Gets off topic sometimes  but it's because of all the class descussions we have. Only Problem is that he mainly only teaches off of power point.
2.5,Very dry. Super nice guy though... ^_^
3,Seems like a really nice guy. Very much a text book professor  lectures are a little dry  but he adds a little info to make them better. He's definitely a nice guy though!
5,Dave is a wonderful teacher. He taught us not only the course material  but he went beyond the realm of the text to help us learn about life and social issues that we weren't aware of. He's great!
1,Truly the sweetest man teaching in the graduate and under-graduate level. Willing to go above and beyond for his students. He is everything a teacher should be. Thank you Dave.

5,Her class is a lot of work  but it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. Show up  start assignments/projects early  study for tests  and ask questions if you need to. There are 11 pop quizzes  but they're only 2 points each  you get to take them with your group  and she checks them over before accepting them. No reason not to get full credit.
4,Nice prof! For exams  just study the notes & UNDERSTAND everything (don't memorize). Her tests are more applying what you learned than memorizing  but VERY doable if you study. While studying think of examples of the content and how you can write about things talked about. The semester long group project sucks IF you have a bad group.
4,Dr. Tandy is a sweet lady. This will not safe you however when it comes to passing this class if you don't work for it. Tests are very tough and there is really no time to study since the semester is full of incredibly long HWs  assignments  SUA  outside of class events and activities. Study early and get ready for tests a long time in advance.
2,She's a sweet lady but that's about the only upside. Unfortunately she is also one of the worst lecturers I've ever had. Spends an insane amount of time talking about inconsequential things and flying through more complicated parts. Exams are not only more complicated than anything you do in class  but also worded vaguely. Avoid her if you can.
4,5 week summer course. Only take this class if you absolutely need to. There is a ton of homework that averages about 2-3 hours a night. Mcgraw Hill based Connect. Do all the practice  the tests are hard but not if you study all the content. The last two exams are challenging. She provides PowerPoints with her speaking. Professor did all she could.
5,She is my favorite accounting professor at UNLV!
4,Really pleasant lady. The class is interesting and it actually made me look more into internal audit. But the group project is a huge pain  especially if you're stuck with a bad group. Have the initiative to ask questions because the instructions are really vague. Do yourself a favor and team up with good students or it'll be a looooong semester.
1,Excessive work and a waste of time. Learned more from professors at CSN than from this woman. SUA  connect homework  networking events  and not enough time for exams. She comes to class smiling  but it's a smile welcoming you to hell. Also  get ready to spend money on class materials. NOT WORTH IT.
5,Had her for internal audit and thoroughly enjoyed the class and her teaching style. The exams and group project count for the majority of your grade  so don't take those lightly. She provides handouts for her lectures  and if you study those you'll be totally prepared for the exams.
1,Took it online over summer. That was the first mistake  unfortunately I had no other option. Took her 1-2 days to respond to my emails & even then  they were unhelpful. McGraw-Hill based course which sucks. Not enough time for the exams and will leave you rushing to guess. Unnecessary/tedious amounts of homework which take hours of your day. BEWARE
3,"4 week online ACC 202. Hmwrk is very time consuming  can use ""check my work."" Suggest getting a perfect score on HW since the tests are hard. There IS NOT enough time for the tests. Answer questions you know and then figure out what you don't since you WILL run out of time. Available for questions via email. Clear layout of HW and points. No EC"
2.5,Class was on-line  a 5 week summer session. Not very helpful  responds to emails at her convince. I had to wait a week to review a test  as she was on vacation. 90 min. is not enough time for tests  with depth of work on questions. Better to take the class during a regular semester with a professor who wants you to succeed. Not sure she does.
5,Took ACC 202 online and was skeptical at first because of the other reviews. She's a great professor and emails right away if you have questions. Read the book  do the practice questions  and double check your calculations  it helps. I got an A on all the exams  but you have to really think outside the box on some questions and manage your time.
4.5,Her Internal Audit class was an excellent elective that helped me better understand the materials in my other classes. The group project had some rough points  but she is a very lenient grader. She lets you take the IIA certification exam in lieu of the final  but I would recommend you just take the final. Her tests are not difficult at all.
5,Great Teacher! Very helpful. Tests are clear and she prepares you well. Great at explaining things gives great examples.
3,Actually a decent teacher. Her powerpoint presentations were very helpful  I barely read at all. The book is $300 which is ridiculous  and she is the only teacher for 202 that uses that book. Her final test is BS and she doesn't curve at all so beware
4,Overall good class that will prepare you for a career in accounting. Group project can be pretty burdensome (especially if you don't get placed into a good group) so be prepared to spend a lot of time on it. ACL assignments are difficult and time consuming and worth very little of the overall grade. Take it only if you are serious about accounting.
4,Took ACC 202 over the summer online. Totally thought I was going to fail because I failed every test but the last one but I still got a C. If you do the online homework and study the notes its possible to do better. Apparently she said she curved the grades. Good thing.
2,ONLINE WARNING: If you take ACC 202 ONLINE then know that the McGraw Hill homework will NOT prepare you 100% for the exams. You will have 90 minutes to take the exams. It is not enough time. Exam 1: Do the definitions first  then the problems. Exam 2: Do the problems with LOTS of Debit/Credits FIRST. Exam 2 made me drop the course. G'luck.
3.5,I would recommend going to class. The material isn't necessarliy hard  but the exam review guides are vague and pretty much include everything. The SUA is time consuming  but if you double check with a group for each part you should be fine. She is very nice and knowledgable about the profession and what employers look for.
5,great professor.
2,He is a subjective marker. Likes you higher grade.
3,Good luck trying to get anything clarified after the class is over.
5,He's a professor who is very passionate about his work. He is very strict about computer use in his class  he yelled a few times at students for using Facebook. The assignments are time consuming and not so easy  but he will help with any questions in person or over email. A very interesting course and I would recommend taking it.
4.5,This professor is one of the best I've had at York. You rarely come across a professor who cares about his students and believes in everyone's potential. His assignments are not easy but he will walk you through them and give you a bunch of useful resources. You will learn a lot in his class.
2,His lectures put me to sleep. He needs to be a little bit more exciting ...
1,The papers and exams are very hard...but I worked very hard to get a B in the end but was bell-curved down to a C because the class average had to be 60. =(
2,All these people have only been talking about the lectures...but they didnt mention the exams and paper. This course is too much for a 1st year course. Alot of work and little return.Sometimes they ask you the smallest thing that was covered in the lectures. No body cares about students because there are too many of them. A tells you to ask B and B
4,"Sometimes his lectures are so boring and unclear that you just want to break the slides. As a person he is very helpful   but sometimes he acts like "" I have things more important than you   so hurry up""."
2,He just reads from his slides  quotes a lot from famous people. But always stutters during his talks and contradicts himself.
5,The best out of the three profs for the class. He had a very good powerpoint w/ actual words not just pictures. And he would explain each point. Very helpful prof. love his lectures.
5,outstanding lecturer  cares much about his students...much better than the other two profs...and much better looking
5,Great course. amazing prof
5,hot accent
5,Amazing professor. Class was interesting and the material is very easy to understand. I took this course as an elective and it was mad easy. The prof's teaching style is good too and I know a lot of people enjoyed him.
4,I find his lectures very interesting and easy to follow. My marks are lower in his classes than any other though. I'd take his course again because I like what he lectures about and how he lectures. He also like Black Sabbath!
5,Excellent prof and interesting course material. Overall great course.
5,Excellent prof and very interesting course. Ta's sucked. I recommend this class b/c its one of the best i took. Professor Jenkins is very helpful and always willing to help students.
5,The material is interesting  the text is short and the prof is a hottie :)
5,excellent
5,Well-spoken  highly intelligent professor. Not terribly outgoing  but really nice and helpful if you take the time to get to know him. Exam is tough...but  would still recommend.
1,Brewbaker sucks. Boring  doesn't make sense  smart ass. No good. I'd never ever recommend one of his classes. I love healthcare law and he completely turned me off of it. BOO!
2,"Starting using the ""casefile method "" which consisted of a treatise + many property ""casefiles"" that were essentially long problems. We were responsible for many pages in the treatise (very hard to comprehend) along with working out the casefiles. Prof. Brewbaker has great passion but lacks in his ability to bring his knowledge to the students."

4.5,Wythe is one of the greatest men you'll ever meet. He is truly a wonderful person. If you get the chance  you should really try and get to know him!
4,He's a socialist. He has an irrational hatred of Bush and all things Christian/Republican/Conservative. He's a true believer and an honest man (personally  not intellectually). His class is not very hard and will enlighten you but beware he's trying to indoctrinate you.
2.5,No Comments
5,By far one of the best class I have taken so far. Required to write a lot of essays but that is the good part about it. You can really see how much you improve from the first essay to the last essay. Definitely recommend!
5,Best professor in the Menifee campus. Very easy and fun class coming from someone who used to hate english. I took her for 92 and 101 and now I am her SI leader (class tutor). I highly recommend this class. You can get an easy A if you keep up with the work. Wonderful person.
4,The best English class I ever had! Her instructions are clear and brief. She is a very easy going professor. The paper are super easy and you even get to revise it for a higher grade.
5,Best teacher ever.
5,This teacher taught me a lot. I asked for help all the time and she always helped me. The class was hard  though I learned and isn't that what teachers are about? Kindness  is one word that discribes Lorrie. I liked her because she was good at what she does 'English writing & grammar' and found it easy to talk to her.
5,Best English teacher I have ever known. She is so helpful and goes above and beyond for her students!!! I would take her for 103 if she taught it.
1,Very confusing. Weekly instructions reprinted from past courses with incorrect dates and misspellings. Poor instructor. She does not seem to comprehend higher level literature.
5,Very easy professor. Lenient grader  lets you resubmit two of the essays  not a lot of work  had to read three very interesting novels  gives you ample time for assignments. One essay per month. Learned a lot form this professor. Do take her!!
3,Took Child's Lit. In class assignments are easy. Homework should be easy but she expects essays to be written like an 8th grader. I am an A English student and I got Cs on some of the essays I turned into her. However  she allows you to rewrite papers for a higher grade. Final was super easy! She comes off as rude sometimes.
3,She is good  you will learn alot
4,Good teacher. Hard grader  and bad handwriting  but still nice.
2,Too much work for very few points.
4.5,she is very helpful and her assignments are clear. If you do your work you will have no problem.
3,Class had a lot of busy work activities. Her grading is extremely hard and sometimes confusing.
3.5,if she doesnt like your writing style your doomed... i did not like her because when i asked her for help on a couple of essays  she gave me responses and then marked me down for the way she told me to correct them... shes nice but dont pick her if your writing style is unique and not to her liking
5,She is awesome. She will bend over backwards to help you. Great teacher.
5,No Comments
5,i have had this teacher for many classes and she is a wonderful teacher. she really helps you write in new and interesting ways. she may require some work out of you but it is well worth it.
1,I would not suggest taking this professor. He is incredibly difficult and the exams are impossible.
5,He makes you work for the grade  but he does give good feedback on how to improve. Also if you participate  it can really help your grade!
4.5,He makes Con Law interesting and loves the subject. A rare ability to take a subject that he knows about and translate for those who aren't at his level. If only more British Profs were like him!
4,Had for both Con Laws. He's very enthusiastic about the material and that makes a world of difference I.M.O. Look  if you are a bigot / federalist society type  you might not like this class unless you like having your ideas challenged/dismissed. He's unabashedly liberal. But you will learn the material. He can be a bit pompous and aloof.
3.5,Exam was ridiculously hard. Good teacher and interesting class  but often talks down to students. Slow to return emails. Be prepared for his grading - he gives out a LOT of C's  and he's very specific on exam (3 1/2 hour exam  by the way).
4,He was tough  but interesting.
1,If he dislikes you you're screwed. He never responded to my emails.
5,Great!
4,He was the hardest professor I ever had at U of L  but he knew this topic and clearly conveyed it. I made an A with him and I was not an A student during law school. I've heard he was really hard for con law  and I also heard you learn it.
3,"If he was half as bright as he thinks he is they'd call it ""Marcos-sun"""
5,As others have said  Edgerton is funny. But that doesn't make him the coolest teacher ever. He goes on long rants and requires that you learn his opnions. His tests are unprofessional and he can sometimes be insulting to certain groups. He is easy and grades on a curve  but his class is very tedious. It's your choice.
4,wayy cool. Funny if you actually listen to what he has to say. actually knows what hes talking about. easy A if you attend class. just sit in the front so you can hear him. I recommend
4.5,Edgerton is great! Really easy class. He gives out the answers to the test the class before each test so you only have to take notes then. He doesn't assign homework and he can be pretty funny. He lectures all class but it isn't bad. Highly recommend!
1,To the point: He is a good teacher if you dont like to study. His study guides are not the test. To find the anwers to the test will take you a few days. He is a good teacher for thouse people that learn by just hearing someone talk. Sorry dont recomend him  he also grades on a curve.
1,this was one of the most boring classes i've ever been to. i literally did not take one note except the class before each test. he would simply read throught the tests and go over the answers. if you don't mind the ridiculous banter and just want an easy A  this is the class for you. if you have difficulty attending boring classes  don't do it.
4.5,Professor Edgerton really knows his stuff. He also tells us about his opinions on different matters which makes the class more interesting. Only 3 exams but when you study the study guides and take notes  you'll be fine. I got an A in this class. :)
4.5,He is a really cool guy. Politics is his profession (he's the mayor of menifee) so he knows what he is talking about. the class consists of only 3 tests  which is intimidating  but if you follow the study guide  it's an easy A. i didn't read my textbook  but needed it to look up terms on the study guide. Great  hilarious man.
4.5,He is so awesome! I would reccomend this class  and professor to everybody! He has tons of knowledge  makes the class fun  and truely cares about his students! I have one more class with him  and I'm actually kinda sad its over!! Believe in the revolution!!
3.5,His lectures can get boring  but you dont really have to show up.I would recomend it since on all 3 exams he had questions regarding his opinion on a certain subject. The tests require a lot of reading and understanding of concepts covered in the text. Even though his lectures are boring he would make the class laugh at almost every lecture.
3.5,The class consists of just 3 exams  which are each 100 q's multi choice. He doesn't care if you are there or not. He only cares about your grades on the exams. Lectures can make you fall asleep. Textbook is needed. There is a lot of reading for the exams. He is a really funny guy  and definitely makes some interesting jokes if you catch them.
4,WE NEED A REVOLUTION! Edge is the coolest old guy ever! he is so funny  yes he does ramble on about current events  but he challanges his students to think outside of their own little boxes. show up for class and use the study guide for an easy A! he has inspired me to become politically active&aware to make this world a better place ~Doc
4,Don't listen to the guy three comments down from mine. Edg is a good teacher. He teaches because he wants to  not because he has to. Its a fun and very easy class. Just write down whats in the margins and bold print  follow the study guide and its an easy A.
5,Reminds you of a really cool grandpa with plenty of stories. Likes to make jokes and tries to keep your attention by saying some pretty controversial stuff. This guy is hilarious. 3 100 pt tests that's it. Invest in flash cards because you need to know a lot of info for tests. Great teacher  great man.
5,"Awesome Professor! He is Hilarious! Great class for night students because he keeps things interesting. He definitely shows his bias on everything and wants you to agree. But he's a politician. What do you expect?? 3 exams-multiple choice  no graded homework. USE THE STUDY GUIDES AND YOU WILL GET AN ""A""!! GUARANTEED. Support Edgerton's Revolution!!"
2,rambles on about current events for most of the class and makes fun of students when hes not teaching for final goes throught test ques by ques and tells you answer huge helpful curve take class if you only want to read text and get A cause although entertaining will not help much in class hard to follow to take notes
4.5,He'll spend the first hour talking about current events. Digresses so much it's insane Funny old guy with good stories and one-liners. Study guide has everything you need to know  so show up if you want. Easy A.
5,Great fun teacher  very very funny makes this class fuN!
5,as long as you took this in high school  you should be fine. most of the time he talks about the current events going on. easy to pass.
5,A Very Wise Man!!!!!!!!!!
3.5,Very good at keeping students interest and multiple choice tests.
2.5,This professor was a little degrading to his students  but none-the-less he was very knowledgable about the subject. There was hardly any homework  and the tests were manageable as long as you attended lecture. Labs let out early often  so over-all I would say he was a decent professor if you need to get this class out of the way.
5,If you're into bio this is the guy for you. His lectures are a bit dry but he is really enthused about what he teaches. had him for my first college semester and he's one of the best.
3.5,Ebert is a great teacher. Hard to pay attention to the lectures sometimes but he grades on a curve and offers extra credit. I missed the final day and didn't even call him till two days after. He took time out of his schedule to give me the test and I passed. Really nice guy and he's really enthusiastic about bio.
3.5,If science isn't your strong subject  Mr. Ebert may not be the teacher for you. He is extremely nice and wants you to learn and succeed. However  he expects you to REALLY KNOW EVERY DETAIL. And yes  the labs are rather looong and un-exciting. There was 3 exams(mult choice) and quizzes for each lab. Great teacher  but overwhelming.
5,Esay for me.
4,Bob Ebert taught Bio 1 to me back in the 80s. He's a great teacher  and after over 10 years including grad school  he was one of my favorites!
5,One of the best professors I've ever had. He really has perfected the art of breaking down complex subject manner in a way anybody can understand. He definitely takes the time to help you. Take him!
4.5,"He is definitely monotonous but his notes and drawings are usually what are on the tests so they aren't bad. He isn't very extroverted but amiable. There won't be problems understanding but beware his multiple choice test where the choice of ""two or more of the above are true""  highly recommended."
5,he is kinda boring unless u are freakishly interested in bio. very good lectures however he wants you to know the lecture notes cold.tests are kinda hard mostly true false sometimes you draw pictures.study hard if you want and A..but hes a sweet guy very helpful!!!cares about his students :)
4,Really nice guy  really knowledgable. He did care about his students learning.
5,This man went out of his way to help his class learn. He really made biology understandable and he even made it relative to every day life. He drew everything out on the board and I thought that his lectures and labs were very colorful. Wonderful teacher!
1,Ebert is the worst professor I have ever had. Simply put  his ideas are outdated and his conservative ideals come through a little too frequently. Lectures are painful.
5,Awesome person. Really nice guy. However  I agree with the boredom factor. He is soooo sweet  but I've never meet someone more monotonous in my life
5,He is a very cool man  who will give you tons of breaks  and knows a TON!!! very smart. However  lectures and labs are soooooooo boringggg  drink lot's of caffeine before comming to class  trust me YOULL NEED IT... but i do recommend EBERT
4,Boring  but a good teacher
4,he is a great teacher for bio
5,Professor Abramson is a fantastic professor! He cares about his students so much and you will learn a lot in his class. His exams are tough. However  taking one if his classes is absolutely worth it.
4.5,The absolute best professor I have EVER had. I don't think it is possible for a professor to care more about his students. He is tough  but he's also unbelievably helpful. He is a breath of fresh air in the stuffy law school atmosphere. Funny and very knowledgable...he wrote the civ pro book.
4,love him! must take before you graduate. no one cares more about his students than les!
5,Absolutely the best. Not only has he written on just about every legal topic imaginable  but he can explain it very clearly as well. He's also extremely accommodating: whether it's going over material outside of the classroom or helping plan your schedule. I took classes I had no interest in just so I could take him for a teacher. It was worth it!
5,My favorite professor. I had him for CivProI&II and CrimProI and he's thorough  witty  helpful and knowledgeable. Exams are difficult but his office hours are excellent and he will give you supplements if you need them to prepare. He hates unprepared students so do your reading and use office hours
4.5,If you put in the effort you do well. I'm not sure about a lot of the questions on the exam  I felt like I did well and got a C  but with an open book test you need to study a lot more than you think. He has high expectations for understanding material and will get easily pissed if you don't know the material when called upon.
5,The Best!
3.5,I never missed a class  made a's  b's  and some c's in law school  and I got a D with him. (I was all A's prior to law school but I cared a little less in law school. This class held my attention though.) I learned a lot  but BE READY for his finals. Consider yourself warned.
4,love him! Very funny  so he keeps your attention-you'll learn a lot  plus you get to watch Cops!
5,A class act
4.5,Great professor! Con Law is fairly muddled as it is  but she does a good job clarifying. Very helpful during office hours. Doesn't really call on students  but likes students who participate so volunteer! Con Law II was even better than Con Law I so stick with her. Very nice prof.
5,Some don't like her style. I'm one of those people who thought her class was great. She teaches Conlaw as bar prep  not as historical study or philosophical discourse. She's also one of the few people I've met who make my liberalness seem moderate. To
2,Apparently  it IS possible to make con law dull and uninspiring. My advice is to bring something interesting to read  she won't notice...oh  and get the Emanuels  it's all in there (unfortunately)
4,Shea is easy and helpful. She clearly explains what she expects upfront and then grades according to the critera she set. Great online classes. Easy  managable and helpful.
2.5,She seemed a little unorganized - slow at returning emails and rarely answered the questions I had.
5,She is one of the best teachers I've ever had. She really cares about her students and makes each one of them feel special. She tells you exactly what you need to do to pass and then gives a chance to redo assignments if you didn't get it right first time
5,Caring instructor
4,Very good instructor. Sets goals and lets you know what is expected of you to suceed in her class. Very good at on-line classes. All future educators should take her classes to learn how to teach in the class room
2,"He is smart as hell  but didn't really ""teach"" - he just wrote on the board without consideration for the existence or uniqueness of any audience. Deciphering missing steps from the board was like solving a puzzle  and there wasn't much value in going to class (I went anyway). Lots of independent learning was needed! Nice exam  very challenging!"
3.5,He's a nice guy  but he is VERY confusing at times. He writes very quickly  causing him to make many mistakes  obvious and not-so-obvious  that will confuse you later. The quizzes are ridiculous but the final for this course is a JOKE.
3,He works very fast. If you PAY ATTENTION he's quite easy to follow. If you get distracted  you miss his explanations and therefore are lost. The problem sets were fair as were the midterm and the final. The final was exactly like the practice exam. Allows formula sheets in the tests.
1.5,"WOW  he is useless  left me confused after almost every lecture. Probably knows his stuff but can't teach at all. His quiz questions are rediculously hard also  the only way to get them is go to a tutorial. He always asks the class if its ""ok?"" and assumes that the silence means it probably is...BUT IT DEFINATELY ISNT OK!"
1.5,Such a bad prof!! Class was VERY borning  spent the whole time taking notes but not understanding them. His answers to questions left me more confused than before I asked. (Have never seen him without his fanny pack on).
2.5,"the midterm average was 57%  what else really has to be said. Writes fast  all over the board  continuously corrected by students  however one-on-one he's actually really helpful The ""any questions"" thing wont even help you because you're so confused on what he just wrote and explained."
2.5,Teaches by doing example after example. Writes very fast on the board and it can be difficult to keep up with him. He does explain concepts clearly though
3.5,"He's not that bad. He just goes a but fast. I have to agree when he says ""Any questions?"" its kinda pointless top say that cause I'm totally not following whats going on. Nevertheless he's not too bad. He could be worse."

1,"The worst prof ever!!!! All he says is  ""any questions?"" when he dam well knows he can't answer it."
1,Set a new standard for unhelpful profs. Goes at his own rapid pace whether or not anyone is following. Highly reccommended if you want to become dumber at math.
1.5,Terrible prof. doesnt help students at all  doesn't answer questions  just all around bad!
5,cool professor i liked her style
5,Hard but fair. Like the discussions. Eye opening.
5,No Comments
2.5,A little green around the edges. Knows her subject material. Too strick for working with adults.
2,Very unprepared in classroom presentations as far as films. Knows her subject very well. Assigns an over abundance of homework. No flexiabilty for absence from classes - to a point of being unreasonable.
4.5,Highly recommended. If you take good notes  and review them before the exam you'll do well. Attendance is mandatory.
5,Awesome teacher. She is fun  funny and really helpful. Don't bother getting the book  it was never used. Only 3 homework assignments and 3 test which were easy if you paid attention in class and take good notes. Highly recommended
5,Loved this class! I felt that this class should be deemed necessary for all people who ever plan to/will procreate...AS it may be seen as a guidebook through early childhood. Don't buy book  not necessary. Test based on lectures  but she is amazing.
5,She's a really nice  smart  and polite person. She is strict on attendance but the textbook is rarely used since all exams are based on her lecture. There are three 50 question texts and 2 research papers that aren't too difficult. Other than that  there isn't any homework. Take good notes and you'll do fine.
4.5,Great lady but puts a lot of your grade on attendance  the class is super easy and fun
5,Fun  Funny  and well organized!! She is a great teacher! I've taken her for Psy 206 also and I enjoy how she maintains the same structure throughout her classes. highly recommend!
5,Mrs. Gregg is very nice  very thorough. She writes detailed notes on the board to accompany her lectures. I recommend the buying the book  as there is some info on the tests that she doesn't put in the notes. Her tests are bit tricky - multiple choice but still tricky (i.e. one option will be: A & B only  another will be: all of the above)
5,Judy Gregg was an AMAZING teacher. No need to get the book. All tests are directly from the notes. She is such a sweet  careing woman. Totally approchable and willing to help out her students. Her teaching method is outlines and labs. Very high-schoolish. Easy tests  multiple choice and common sense.
4.5,Very good teacher. There is 4 observation labs  3 test  and attendance is mandatory if you want 100 points for it. Don't need the book just take good notes.
5,Great lady! doesnt return emails but the class it great. ive taken psych and child devlpmnt with her and she an amzing teacher. doesnt use the book at all but all the notes she gives in class are extremely critical come test time!
5,I can't put into words how awesome an experience her class was. I have a little one at home and her chld dvlpmnt class helped so much. She's organized  clear  and you just appreciate that very much. Don't buy the textbook  her notes are all you need and some common sense. She also has very nice legs.
4.5,Very Smart Teacher. her notes are clear as well as her lectures. You can tell she knows what shes talking about. Her tests are multiple choice but its common sense anyways. Dont bother buying the book!! her notes are more informative. Shes also super stylish!! I love seeing what shes wearing each class.
5,I had Judy Gregg for Psych 206 as well as child 114. She is an amazing teacher  very helpful  clear and has great style! I totally recommend her!
5,I had Judy Gregg for psych 206 as well as Child 114. She is an amazing teacher  very helpful  clear and has great style! I totallt reccommend her!
5,Professor Gregg is one of my favorite teachers so far at Citrus. She makes me really love going to class because she makes it so interesting. Though it was a waste of money buying the textbook  there is a lot of note-taking but worth it because it helps prepare you for tests. I love her!
5,Great teacher! She's straightforward  funny  and makes the subject interesting. Barely used the book. Tests are on the notes. You have to do a few easy observations and some in-class group work.
5,I had Judy Gregg for child 112 and Psy 206 and she was great. You never had to read the book or use it. the notes are enough. her tests are also super easy and you just need your notes to study from.
5,Professor Gregg is my favorite teacher at citrus so far. She is really passionate about what she teaches and will make you feel the same way. We didnt use the book alot the tests were easy if you paid attention and STUDY YOUR NOTES cause the questions are directly from them. I wish she could teach all my classes!! take her class!!
5,I was warned by a student that this lady was really hard on you. The work was a lot  and I was recommended NOT to take her class  but I did. I am so glad I took it. She is an awesome teacher  mentor  and person. She reminds me of my aunt. She is very kind and clear on her notes. I DO recommend taking her classes.Take a chance.
5,she is a wonderful teacher. notes are critical. the book was never used. tests are purely from the notes and observations are done. very interesting course material.
1,I'm taking her class right now and to be honest one word to describe her is UNORGANIZED! Her lectures are all over the place  puts up power points for like 5 seconds then moves on. I tried to approach her for some help but she looks at me like I was dumb for not understanding the first time. Hands out way too many papers  and does not explain them.
3.5,Loved Mrs. Perry! At the beginning of the semester  she said the class would be hard. But as long as you read the text and pay attention to her lectures  you should pass with flying colors. She applies some of her life stories to her lectures  which makes it very easy to understand. Lot's of extra credit opportunities as well!
2.5,There are 4 tests 1 final and 1 paper. She's nice and approachable but unorganized. Be prepared to write REALLY fast  always take notes as she often asks ?s at the end of class and expects you to answer in the form of a short paragraph. She also puts you into groups. Her tests are hard  her lectures have little to do with whats on the test.
3,Prof Perry is a very unorganized but she makes up for it with a lot of extra credit. I can honestly say that if you study what she gives in her study guides then you should be good. She didn't require finals for people who have 96% and above and trust me  I had like a 103% cause of the extra credit.
1,Skips through power point slides in lecturesthen doesn''t go back to them but moves on to other power points. Doesn''t say much towards slides. It''s devastating how she doesn''t give time to write down info from slides. All she says is it''s on blackboard. How are we suppose to learn this way We pay to take the class. For what To teach ourselves
2,Get the book. Her PowerPoints don't have much to do with what's on the test. Grades On a curve.. Over all easy class
2,Get the book. Her PowerPoints don't have much to do with what's on the test. Overall easy class just have to learn on your own
2,She's really nice and funny but she is all over the place. Her powerpoints and lectures are interesting but rarely have anything to do with her tests. She covers alot of material but you don't know where to start when you study. Her little study guides aren't very useful either. She curves her tests so that helps tremendously. She's okay overall.
2.5,Very easy class. She curves her tests so receiving a B is easy. The powerpoints and study guides don't help much with tests. I never read the textbook and still received an A. I have a 101% in the clas.
1,Boring instructor. All she did was lecture from the book and test. What I learned was strictly from reading. Questions are not welcome.
4.5,I suggest reading the material ahead of time from the text (if you don't have it  they have it in the library which I used because textbooks are $$). Do the extra credit ALWAYS  that means come to class or else you will miss out. 1st day she'll pick on people to participate  don't let this scare you away!! She stops after around the 2nd week:)
1,She is very unorganized  her lectures and power points had nothing to do with her tests  she rarely covered what was going to be on the test. Her in class assignments felt like they were meant just to take up time Do not recommend taking her class She makes an easy class hard with her teaching
2.5,not the most interesting class..just the usuall run over notes and one or two in class assignments..testing is based on what she talks about ..this class is missing something to catch student attention
5,THE BEST PROFESSOR
4,I loved her class. It was very easy to get an A.If you do your h.w.  class assignments and study  it wont be hard at all to get an A. There are tons of extra credit assignments. I recommend Prof. Perry.
4.5,Really loved this class! She's a great prof & gives a lot of helpful advice for future teachers! She always gave back papers & tests. She does a lot of group work  but it definitely helps! Take a chance and take her :)
5,Idk what everyone is talking about. She's great. Always gave me back all my papers and replied to my emails. If you're leaving a negative comment then that probably means you got a bad grade. Which is obviously your own fault. I got a 98%
1.5,this professor is seriously the most disorganized teacher at citrus. she misplaces work  doesnt respond to emails  and shows preference between students. if you are going to take her save a copy of all of your work!!!!
2.5,I am in her D.E class. It is the middle of the week and we still haven't received our H.W yet  but we are still expected to turn it in by the same deadline. I am really disappointed with this teacher because how are we expected to do good when you short us on our time to complete assignments? I'm so frustrated with her =(
3,I like Mrs. Perry. I am currently taking her Child 114 online class. Her Hw is very easy! Her website is a bit confusing but not totally unmanageable. I have learned so much in her class & totally recommend it. Its easy... I have put minimal effort in and have 100% on all my work! :)
5,Dr. Giger is awesome he totally loves God and his conducting and teaching show that. I love this man heh.
5,mmmmmm
5,He is a great Prof. He knows what he is doing. His beard is also very hot and his silver hair makes him distinguished.
5,He is a great Prof. I like his legs personally but he is a man of God and that comes across in his teaching.
5,He's the freakin' man... and he's gorgeous.
5,Nice guy  good teacher and conducter.
5,hes hot! Take him if given the chance!

1.5,VERY respectable conductor  however  as a teacher he rather lacks in teaching skills.
2.5,No Comments
5,I'm not a major  but I've always loved music  and Dr. D reawakened my love for choir. He really cares about his singers  just be ready for quartets  and remember it's not the end of the world if you have to go in for re-sings.
5,My Experience with Dr. Greg Detweiler made me choose a different career path. Originally I pursued music as a hobby. I graduated from MSU with a degree in Political science. Through his support and guidance I now coach VoiceOver and have a successful career in the arts. It started with concert choir and ended with practice!
3,Expects a lot from his choir  which is not a degree you can get here. He expect you to practice. He wants the best from a student  which sometimes he sounds rude (sometimes racial)  to prove a point. Don't forget to go to class! You get downgraded if you miss 3 classes.
4,Dr. Detweiler can really make a choir sound fantastic. However  he let's student leadership run away with itself sometimes creating disorganization and frustration. Students should not be grading their peers  and I feel that Dr. Detweiler should watch more carefully over his leaders when he delegates.
5,Detweiler is genuinely nice and means well with everything that he does. That being said  he will not let you bs your way through choir. He's a professional and expects you to begin viewing music as your future profession as well. Bring your music. Get your notes. Stop by his office and say hi sometime. Smile and wave in the hall - he'll love you.
2.5,I think he really cares but is just extremely awful showing it. Likes to do everything himself  which does not leave much time to help students. So you would need to book a time convenient for him. Look forward to your quartet which is recorded and graded. If you are good at sight-reading and sulfege  you would do well. Sorry for the newbies.
4.5,Dr. D. is kind-hearted and passionate about choral music. He takes a genuine interest in those students who prove interest in his classes. He does not reward sarcasm but delights in respect. He expects excellence and prides those who take the extra time to practice their parts outside of regular class time. OH  HOW I LOVE TO SING!
5,He is a great man. He expects you to practice  be passionate  and learn fast. You learn to do what you're supposed to  and it is a very enjoyable experience. He is EXTREMELY talented and is the best choral conductor i've ever met.
2.5,This teacher was very passive-aggressive and picked favorites. Overall  his class was not a good experience.
4,this guy made me hate all choral activities with a passion. if you absolutely MUST take his class  please remember that choir isn't everything and ignore all the whining from the choir officers too  your life is not gonna end if you have to re-sing or don't make s#!% from their stupid fundraisers.
3,He made me hate choir!

3,i love him  can't understand him
4.5,Love Dr. D. OH HOW I LOVE TO SING!!!
4.5,i love dr. detwiler...he's a very funny guy and a great teacher...however  he has some trouble remembering names...it took him four times of meeting me to actually remember mine lol
4.5,I really admire his passion about music  and his interest in the students. He's a truly amazing and good-hearted person. The top of his profession. Bravo Dr. D!
4,Dr. Detweiler has a great way of getting a group to come together and blend for a truly beautiful sound.
5,I love Greggy D!

5,Nicest teacher I have ever had. Creates many opportunities for you to make extra credit.
5,Great teacher. Very helpful. Genuinely wants students to succeed not only in class  but also in life.
5,Really Understanding and fair Professor. She does the job perfectly. She allows chances and make up works. She gives out extra credits for you to show your efforts to recover your mistakes. She is good at what she's teaching.
5,Prof. Adams has the students best in mind when she teaches this class. She gives you ample chances to get your work done and is very fair. I would highly recommend you take her class.
5,Professor Brenda Adams class is a class you definitely will not regret taking. Professor Adams is super nice and helpful  really cares about students learning the material. not only that but also to pass the class. For anyone interested in taking this class  i definitely recommend To take the class with Professor Adams.
4.5,Prof. Adams is compassionate and understanding. She gives extra credit to help boost your grade and is concerned about each of her students. She goes out of her way to make sure you succeed. She's also very personable and adventurous. She has a sense of humor and makes the effort to develop a relationship with her students.
4.5,Professor Adams is a great teacher. She is very nice and very approachable. She always wants her students to learn and understand the material. You will not regret taking her class.
5,Professor Adams  is awesome and very helpful
5,Very good teacher!
5,Brenda Adams is a great teacher. She is very helpful and understanding. Always willing to help everyone.
5,i wish all professors were like her.her style of teaching is awesome.great person overall. take her class you will not regret it
5,Greatest professor I have ever had  I wish she would teach all my classes. Her shoe of teaching is awesome  you will learn a lot like I did as a person who's really bad with technology. Take her class and your life will be changed.
4.5,Great Teacher
5,Professor Adams is very friendly. She likes to help her students to succedd. I very much enjoyed being in her class. Her assignments are easy as long as you stay on top of the work she gives.
4.5,i love her class. Mrs.Adams is always trying to find a way to help the student's grade go to its max. she is super fun and nice.plus her class isnt hard at all..
3.5,She is a big kid. She stays up late playing The Legend Of Zelda sometimes. If you want a fun business class  look no further. This class helps you learn and you will pass if you do your darn work.
5,She is good teacher and very kind individual. I introduce her to my son  and he said  Ms Adams is the nicest in PCC. Her BIT25 is an important knowledge. Take her class!
4,Ms Adams was a kind teacher. She tried to improve her slides from the previous semester to spruce things up. Her lectures can be a bit dull if you know the material already  but she is a helpful and encouraging teacher. She has patience and the eagerness to help you pass.
5,One of my favorite teachers of all time! Really helpful  really welcoming. YOU CANNOT GO WRONG!
5,Im Hispanic  came to class half awake after work ending at 8:30am  to her class starting at 9am. Loads of Extra Credit  Its impossible to not want to try. I'm a C student  If I can get an A in this class  anyone reading this should be able to do the same. Take here class  Trust: No Regrets. PCC's Best teacher Hands down. PS: She is SUPER NICE!!!!!!
2,*shudders
1.5,Class is very easy  just show up and do the reading. Dr. Cross is not so fun though  I don't think she ever learned how to smile
1,difficult to relate to...intense personality...instructional nightmare
5,AN EASY 4.0.
1,How can a professor be so bad? Because the social work program is so bad.
5,Very professional and clear.

5,One of the best clases I've ever taken. Teaches you a lot and maintains interest. responds well to questions and is available for help any time. Fair grader  scales when tests are too hard and assigns very good hw problems. Because of him I even took Phys 121. Gives extra credit. Wish he taught all of my classes because I love his sense of humour.
4,this guy is awesome. to get an A in his class is soooo easy. i mean  it doesn't mean u're gonna learn much  but an A is very possible. 
2.5,Mildly entertaining lecturer  but not enough examples in class and his tests suck. If you don't like multiple-choice exams  avoid him if possible.
2.5,Mediocre.
1,Not a good teacher for this class. Basically copies all the examples from the book  then reiterates them (not accurately) to a bored am class. Meanwhile  the tests and homework are using physics we don't want to meet in a dark alley.
5,he was my thesis advisor and i thought he was awesome. he has great explanations and is very helpful  you just have to try!
4,Great guy  he has fun teaching the subject and that rubs off on students. Granted he loves physics  but is hasn't bothered us this semester. I really recomend him.
5,This class and the homeworks are by no means impossible if you take notes in class.He doesn't want to simply feed you formulas  he wants you to UNDERSTAND them and their applications  and that involves physics sometimes. In a word (or 4) he is friendly  funny  intelligent  and HELPFUL!
2,He would be a great physics teacher  but when he teaches calc he keeps putting physics problems in!
1.5,He definitely shouldn't be teaching calc. He almost never gives examples with numbers. We bought the $100 book and NEVER touch it. He never gives easy homework problems to practice with. Only hard problem sets which are nearly impossible without practice and a big eraser.
1,Can not stand this class with him. Makes me feel stupid ona regular basis and gives homework that is too hard and never gives examples in class.
1,Should not be teaching calculus
4.5,Super friendly man  very approachable and excellent with explaining things on the lower level... And not too shabby to look at either.. hehe
3.5,He is a great professor  very enthusiastic and willing to help! take a class with him if you can!

4,Very nice man. Confusing at times  but is always willing to help you during his office hours. Very very fair w/ grades.

5,Brother Zenger is a fantastic teacher and he really cares about his students. Even if you don't like insects  you should take his general entomology class. It will change your life.
4,Bio 475 is really not a difficult class. There are a few tests  but all the questions are given beforehand and discussed in class. The semester ends with a debate  which is pretty fun. My only advice and warning would be to FOCUS ON THE PAPER. You choose your topic after the first week  so just keep up with it.
4,I loved evolution with Bro. Zenger. The subject matter itself is pretty easy. Just read from the text book  and discuss in class. There is a very large paper you have to write  which is a lot of work  but you get to choose what you write about  so that helps. Bro. Zenger is a great teacher and he cares deeply about his students.
5,Great teacher had a lot of fun
4,Really nice guy. Class can be a little boring at times but it is mostly because of the material that we have to cover. He does a pretty good job of using different teaching methods.
3.5,I loved Brother Zenger. He was so nice and willing to help and made class interesting. Just do the homework and come to class and study for the tests which were difficult  but as long as you study  its pretty easy. Loved the study guides and reviews in class.
4.5,Brother Zenger is very helpful and definitely wants you to succeed! The homework is easy  but the exams are a bit hard  so make sure to study for them!
5,Excellent and passionate professor  he is extremely willing to help you out in class. He really inspires you to think and learn in his class.
4.5,He is my favorite teacher. One homework assignment is due before each class. It takes about an hour  if you're focused. We watch videos and do interactive science activities online for lots of the homework assignments. I don't think anybody makes science as fun as he does. Attending class is important for quizzes. You won't find a better teacher.
2,The class was fairly easy but the tests were very poorly written. It seems to me like he tries to trick you. He required a textbook that was only on amazon and we only ud it twice and there were hardly any questions over the reading in the text book. I felt like he wasn't prepared for class because the class time was not over the prep assignments.
4.5,Fairly good teacher  I enjoyed his classes. Expect to do homework for each class and don't trust your original quiz score. Not only are his multiple choice tests difficult (A&B  A&C  C&D  all of the above)  but he makes the test the day before you take it and fixes any errors after you take it. Overall  nice teacher  fairly difficult class.
4,I really enjoyed taking Brother Zenger's class. The homework was not hard  mostly busy work. Doing the homework and attending the test prep sessions really helped me on the tests. He is helpful and willing to meet after class if you have any questions.
5,Loves the material  is enthusiastic  tries hard to create fun activities  is very understanding of students  and is a push over. He cares more about the material than the grade  which is good for those interested in the material  as well as those who just need the grade. He is a great teacher.
3.5,Origins of Life class: Excellent teacher! He was really excited whenever anything new came up or great questions were asked. He will answer questions right when you ask them. If you talk to him about problems you are having in the class he will help you out with them. He gets you engaged in discussions. Tests DO test you but aren't too bad.
4,Brother Zenger is great at teaching  but I was surprised by his disinterest in the class. I would suggest taking another teacher who will be more invested in their lower level classes. I felt like we didn't learn near as much as we could have because he was more concerned with his higher level classes.
5,Excellent teacher! Plan on doing a fair amount of homework and making sure to come to class  but you'll learn a lot.
3,Very interesting class  easy homework and assignments. The tests are so hard though. I would study for hours and go into the test and feel like I had never seen the material before. The tests do not follow the study guide. Very hard to know what to study for.
3,A info crammer pure. He will assign a chapter and a quiz after each class. Which is easy to skate by. is unmerciful and lets satan write tests
3,He was a great teacher for BIO204 once you get use to his teaching methods. There is reading for every class with a study guide. The tests both lecture and lab  follow the study guides and lab reports very closely so if you study it isn't hard to do well on the tests. But the tests are all write on and you have to be able to explain. Fun Class.
5,This was a great class. He made us think and come up with ideas that we would never have stumbled upon otherwise. He tackled evolution with a finesse that is admirable in a church school. I learned a lot in a scientific way and still found strengthening in my testimony. HIGHLY Recommend!
4.5,very good professor! she's so sweet. she seems kind of hard nosed at first but once you get used to her she's very nice and extremely helpful. i've taken lower level physiology courses before this one and got very good grades in them but i didn't really understand the subject until i took her class.
5,If you work hard she will help you anyway she can! Shes a great teacher  she'll get you to know what you need to know!
3.5,teacher was good for most part. felt like she treated class like children rather than adults we are.
4.5,"Expects great things from her students. If you give your all  you will succeed--if not  you will not be respected by her. Weird sense of humor  took me awhile to ""get"" her. I bet she's fun when she lets her hair down!"
4,Dr. Sydlik is a great lady and a firm but fair teacher who wants her students to suceed.
3,No Comments
5,Dr. Sydlik is the best teacher I ever had!
5,I thought Dr. Sydlik was very helpful. I had her in her first semester  and I liked her very much  she was very clear and concise. As far as treating her students like 12 year olds goes  if you are inconsiderate  she's going to let you know about it.
1.5,she treats all of her students like 12 y/o's.
1,Not at all helpful.
5,A maniac who digs insects! A blast to work with! Bring on more Rolling Rock!
5,"Had him for invertebrate zoology and parasitology  but sadly not entemology. Very tough  definitely. Yet  you learned a lot and will definitely never forget his classes. Tests were difficult  but fair. Too bad he retired. I'll miss his quirkiness (""Doo da...da da dee doo dum""-->anyone who had him understands) and enthusiasm. Thanks Dr. Alsop!"
5,Great take him if you can take the heat
1,he is the devil incarnate....i hate him a lot and a lot....he ruined my grade for biology and my future....with a normal lab professor i would have gotten 40% of lab....its a miracle that hes retiring...i only wish he did it sooner
1,took this class over because of him and got 36 out of 40 on the lab with diff. prof. dont even take this dude
1,THANK GOD he's not teaching lab this semster. This son of hairless lady is hard.
1,No Comments
3,advice to people who are registering for him for 107 lab you will never get a good grade I guarantee you. He loves labs and goes into toooo much detail. For 220 and parasit  hes very interesting. Hes a tough grader though. You study and study and study and you get a 60. But very interesting and enthusiastic abt his work.
4.5,Great professor  keeps you interested! Very quirky fellow. If you like to breeze through a class  he is not for you. His tests are very hard. but ask around  you can find his old exams  and they are almost identical!
5,Alsop is the g.o.d. of bio at queens. he is very fair and a lot of fun to work with. i wish every professor had the enthusiasm of this guy.
5,This is the best professor ever! If you don't love him  you are a lazy incompetent waste of space!
4,I took 12 credits with Alsop and I enjoyed his classes and did well in all of them  lots of hard work  tho. If you're stupid  don't take him. Don't recommend him for non-bio majors.
1,I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY HE'S TEACHIGN BIO! HE SHOULD BE TEACH SOME KIND OF MENTAL CLASS!!!
1,No Comments
1,DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER. HE IS TERRIBLE AT DOING THE JOB HE IS PAID TO DO. AND ON TOP OF THAT HE IS A MEAN SPIRITED PERSON WHO DOESNT CARE FOR STUDENTS
1,he is a terrible teacher so stay away at all costs. he will fail u and enjoy doing it
1.5,alsop and dervin are the two teachers u should avoid at all costs  he's very tough on grading  doesn't explain****  reads the labs inside and out. DONT TAKE HIM IF U WANNA PASS BIO!!!!!!!!!!
4,hard but fair
5,Hard..We are lucky to have a professor who is so excited about the material and teaching
4,super hard class but she was a great prof
4,She co-taught the class with Dr Melendez. As a result I believe most people compare her to Melendez. That being said many dislike her because she doesnt spoon feed you everything that you need to know for the tests (which Melendez does). But if youre willing to pay attention during lecture and actually work a little for the class she's a great prof
4,She is amazing. She came around to every single recitation to try to get to know her students ( enough said). she will always be there for you to answer any questions you have and will defiantly try to curve your grade up (a bit) if she sees you're hard working and diligent.
5,Prof Katty is great. I'm currently having her. I do not know why people complain. Genetic is a challenging subject. Work hard  read the textbook and you willbe ok. She has a good knowledge of the subject. I do not blame the prof for poor grade but the effort. u get what you put in. i recommand katty but be prepare to work hard  read the texbook.
1,"I love genetics  but am very disappoinetd with this class and professor. Her lectures are based on 30 pictures taken from text book. She will read the captions ""word for word"" out of the book. SHe can't explain anyhting. LOts of homework problems  NOT COVERED in class or recitation. And they're on exams? HOW is that acceptable? worst prof so far"
3.5,She's a heavy powerpoint user. Concentrate on all the material on the slides as they will show up on the tests. The problem is that sometimes obscure information shows up on the tests as well. Very clear and articulate in the lectures  but sometimes doesn't match the tests.
2.5,Lecture is boring she has pictured from textbook in PowerPoint and she explains them. Recitations are very important they are guaranteed to be in the test. No reviews so going to lecture gives a sense on what?s on the test  she has difficulty explaining thing but go to her office if u need help.
2,wish I would've looked @ this site b4 choosin her class bc comments r right on target. I read every single chapter covered  did every single HW problem & studied a great deal & ended up with B-. She doesn't knw answers 2 most questions asked by students & her lectures r useless  she uses images from textbook only in slides & exams are hard. BEWARE!
1,Horrible...please don't waste your time with this women.Take genetics somewhere else.Not only is she extremely boring  but she is extremely inept as well.Many questions were asked by students most of which she could not answer.She even admitted that she has a difficulty with teaching genetics.Very disappointing considering her PHD status.
1.5,I enjoy Genetics but it is not my most natural subject. I read the book for every chapter covered in this class  and to be frank  the textbook was rather useless for the majority of the chapters. Her lectures derive directly from the textbook with no explanation provided. While she is rather approachable she simply cannot answer questions  it se
2.5,Genetics class is hard. She puts very tricky questions on exam.READ EVERY WORD OF EXAM. She uses clickers so you must attend class but you cant take notes in class. Slides are exact copies from textbook - she puts no work into teaching. She is a NICE person but a bad teacher. You really have to study to pull an OK grade. Overall not Recommended . .
1,The most horrible teacher ever!! She is not organized  doesn't help you out  and also gives no review sheet  places wrong answer keys to previous exams  just bad. She teaches from the textbook. and the exams are hard  really hard
4,Class was a Joke. Easy bio class  just do your work. Slides are simply images from books so no extra info to remember. Tests are relatively simple and recitation is easy.
1,slides are not helpful n not organized.. no notes at all..
5,Great class- really simple exams  mostly mc
1,She's very hard and she uses only the slides which are not helpful at all. The exams are dam hard.
1,This proff  doesnt know how to teach.
5,The class was so interesting  and the subject was fascinating. you can tell that she realy likes the subject too  also even though sometimes she may seem unapproachable  she is very willing to answer questions  and appreciates good ones. The tests are fair  you need to study  but they're not (usually) ment to trick you.I totally recommend this clas
4,Slightly boring lecturer  but she knows her stuff and her tests are pretty fair.
1,THis woman is a condescending mean individual.Doesnt care about anything  its her way or no way and her lectures are sooooooo boring. Tough grader and her minons are morons too.
5,Cynthia was a great teacher! She always answered your questions without making you feel like an idiot like most teachers. She was so understanding and caring!! She is also funny  which is a plus! Apply yourself and you shouldn't have one problem!
5,You have to make sure that you attendant class throughout the entire 8 weeks. Lecture is something that you don't want to miss because almost every week you have a quiz due that's based off lecture. Taking notes is always the best so that you can go over your notes and be sure to pass your quiz. Didn't use the book as much so i wouldn't get it.
2,By far the hardest class I've ever taken. This class was SO hard. I studied all the time. Cynthia's lecture is all over the place and it makes it very hard to take good notes. She's very scatterbrained and her lecture is confusing with the powerpoint she makes. She won't help you very much in the lab. Wish I could explain some more but I ran out.
4,She is the sweetest professor  she is kind of difficult but if you listen and study you will be fine.
5,Cynthia really makes sure you know she is there to help you at anytime. She even came to our study group on a Sunday in her personal time. She expects you to work at learning  not just show up. Anyone saying she's a bad professor wasn't willing to put the work in. Tests are a little tricky  be careful.
5,Cynthia doesn't play  she expects you to pre-read the material before coming to class each day. Then in class she expects participation. She will ask you questions. She tries to guide u to the answer but is often confusing how she does it. She was very helpful outside of class. She seems intimidating but is truly a kind soul. Ask & she will help.
5,I loved Cynthia and the way she taught her class. She lets you know she's there for you the whole way through. You definitely won't float through cell biology because it's not an easy subject but if you do the work as she suggests and participate in class you'll be fine. She's so passionate about what she teaches  a truly awesome professor.
2,I gave Cynthia some credit for being encouraging but her tests are ridiculously hard and she is not approachable in lab for questions. Her midterms and final exams are beyond what anyone should be expected to know  and when you ask a question in lab she will only tell you that you're not correct and walk away instead of being more supportive.
5,Cynthia will see you for what you are. Don't take her classes if they're a check in the box for your degree program. But if you're passionate  and actually care about the subject matter  Cynthia is an incredible leader help you realize your goals. She WILL let you know if you aren't cut out for the field. Which is a much needed trait in a teacher
1,She is very scatter brained. Although she knows her stuff her lecture is all over the place which makes it hard to take good notes. She makes up and writes her own quizzes with a lot of trick questions  so read the questions carefully! She will expect you to read and fully understand the class information before coming to class. Very hard Class!!!
1,Cynthia expects you to already know the material in class before learning it and when you ask questions she makes you feel stupid and says you should already know the answer and tells you to ask class members for the answer. very scatterbrained jumps from topic to topic. i learned absolutely nothing from her  i learned more by teaching myself.
5,Cynthia is a very great instructor  she really does her best to get everyone involved! I enjoyed her class very much  but I'm not much of a morning person. So my brain was only half awake! Very sweet lady!
1,This was by far the worst class of ALL my classes offered at KVCC. This Instructor talks way above your head. Doesn't offer any extra credit to help you out and if you let her know you are struggling she will tell you straight to your face that you should reconsider your goals for the future!!! Horrible
2,Cynthia is completely scatterbrained. She adds new assignments randomly and due dates change all the time  so you get confused by all of her confusion. Takes forever to grade. Exams hardly reflect lecture at all. Talks above what most people even know yet  like we are already microbiologists  when we're actually there to LEARN.... Horrible teacher.
4,Cynthia is a very good professor. She is very passionate in her work and knows her stuff. If you don't put in the work and don't study you will not do well in this class. She is the one of the best instructors at KVCC.
2.5,This professor goes too fast and has high expectations.
4.5,Professor Schauer is a passionate  compassionate person. She is patient beyond measure and helps students succeed. She fosters a place of learning  not just spitting out the right answers. Schauer encourages questions  not just perfection. She takes classes out of her profession so she understands being clueless!Awesome person in and out of class!
5,Cynthia is an awesome instructor!! I am sad this will be my last class with her! I took her for both Cell Biology and Microbiology and really enjoyed her class! She is super smart and really cares about the students doing well  and wont let you give up!! Her lectures are interesting  and labs are so much fun!
3,Cynthia is a really nice and knowledgeable lady. She doesn't use the book so I wouldn't waste your money. She is all over the place when it comes to when things are due or whats going on in the class in general. Shes really frustrating in regard to any type of class schedule and you have to remind her of things several times.
5,Cynthia is AWESOME!! I never write these reviews but I wanted to for this class because she is fabulous! She actually makes the subject material make sense! She has a real passion for what she teaches! Shes very prompt at answering emails and is EXTREMELY helpful!! I am hoping to have her again as an instructor!
5,It's been almost 20 years since my first class with her  but she still ranks as my favourite professor. Her intro course motivated me to change my minor. Wish I could take her classes again.
5,I wish she was still here becasue I would like to take more classes with her. I loved her class and her teaching style. I miss her!
5,She's easily my favorite professor  she's understanding and helpful and a relatively easy marker. Intro was hard  but past that she eases up and gets to know you quickly! I love all of her jewellery!
5,beautiful professor  beautiful woman. so kind and more than fair exams. interesting lectures  great prof. all good things to say!
4,Nice but dry. Take notes  read text and you'll be fine.
5,Excellent prof

5,Easy  easy easy. Very interesting lecturer and tests are cake. I mean really  she gives you 8-10 long answer questions to choose from  and you pick two. What more do you want??
4,Very organized and clear in lectures.
2,Blaaah.
2.5,well  she is alright  but she mutters and dosent know what she is talking about unless she has her notes  otherwise its almost impossible to take notes  she also jumps from topic to topic  not my fav prf by any means
4,hard to get a good mark in her intro course  but she gets better as you go  and as she gets to know you! She rocks!
3,Hard marker on long answer. Exams are tough. Apparently she is a feminist...but never really found that
4,Jim was great and was usually always prepared for lectures. He oftentimes went over indie games and how well designed some of them are. This helped contribute to our game's design decisions. He met up with each team each week and gave critical  brutal advice. Not all of it was gold  but he definitely helped us (especially with art direction)
1.5,He is a nice guy  but should not be teaching game design classes. He gives horrible advice that drove our project into the ground. He doesn't understand games at all. If you take any of the senior capstone classes with him  it would probably be in your favor to ignore what he advises you change about your game  which is to say everything.
4.5,Good teacher for Intro To CMPS if you need it for a GE or major. His class was very easy
5,Jim is a really nice and helpful  teacher. If you need help on the homework or an extension for a week or so  he will definitely let have your time with the assignments. Really enjoyed being in his class. Highly recommended.
4.5,Best Class EVER! Got to play video games for homework  the midterms were pretty easy and Professor Whitehead was a very nice and approachable guy. A++++
4,Pointless class  dull lectures  don't use book  but an easy A.
5,THIS CLASS ROCKED! Jim is a great teacher. He knows what he's talking about. Game demos in/during class completely relevant to lecture  and they are all great games. Jim is obsessed with Shmups  but it makes a good inside joke. I had a great time in this class  and I am trying to be a TA next year.
5,GYM is AWESOM!! He let us play games in class and let us joke about his white head! We played on a console pretty much everyday!
5,SO MUCH FUN! Not an easy class  but definitely worthwhile. Lectures were entertaining and relevant to today's gamers. Highly recommended.
4,Nice guy  very cool. obsessed with SHMUPS. the work is easy  the assignments aren't too bad. You can study for the tests for 1 or 2 hours and get an A. Making the video game is awesome  and the top 4 video game creation groups get prizes (Like an X-Box 360 for example). If you ever wanted to make a video game  take his class  especially w/ friends.
5,"This guy wants to make the game design course easy for you  though he doesn't necessarily know all the answers. You can ignore what you get on the tests as long as it's anywhere near passing  the only thing that matters is the final project. You must take that project seriously - it's not ""fake"" like in other blow-off classes."
4,Jim is extremely nice and understanding. He's a great guy who really wants to make his class interesting. Those who took 80k and feel he was unclear or stubborn are wrong! His notes spell out what will be on the test  he published study guides online  and encourages discussion on the various topics in class. He even let me make up a midterm!
1.5,Creating video games sounds cool. NOT with this guy. Very disorganized. Very stuborn. His test dont test knowledge. cool guy  but sucks as a teacher. he came 30 minutes late to our exam. had another exam a week before our project was due  and wouldnt push it back becuase he wanted to demo the projects(create video game) for the last few classes.
5,Whitehead is a very clear  concise teacher who really makes an effort to make the material somewhat interesting. He doesn't try to trick you and the class is very laid back and  for an engineering class  really decent.
5,Really a good teacher. He's able to make sense of the many concepts taught in the course and doesn't ask tedious/picky questions on his tests. He requires many readings but that's a very positive thing. He's very effective from a truly educational perspective. Great teacher and person to talk to.
5,One of the better teachers in the CS department
5,No Comments
2,Boring. Too much reading for an engineering course
1,I have to agree with the others
1,I honestly believe that my 6 year old could have got an A in this class. I still don't have a clue what Forensic Accounting is but I have an A on my record.
1,Does not communicate well with students in his online classes. We very seldom heard a word out of this guy but if you want an easy A then go for it. Of course you still wont have a clue as to what the material means and you may need to repeat the class at a later time
4,Jason is a seasoned professional on various levels. While his technique of lecturing is everything but lively  if you follow what he says  and walk off the lecture path with him  you learn alot more than with the textbook. Great sense of humor too!
3,No Comments
5,A nice guy  and decent teacher. Really likes what he does  and is helpful.
5,Professor Cohen is a great professor. Honestly  as long as you grasp the concepts of any programming language then translate them to the appropriate language that you're learning  you're good. There's a lot of homework  and the exams are all right  not too bad.
4.5,Barry is a very good teacher  he will adapt his lecture depending how fast the class is going and will give very helpful advice at recitation.
4.5,Great teacher  was able to learn. They provide labs that you need to do. Do those and you can basically pass.
4.5,Barry Cohen is one of the best computer science professors in NJIT. His use of class time is remarkable (except for the times when he goes off into tangents). He is very knowledgeable about the material  and his use of classroom assistants is definitely made to help students. I would highly recommend him.
4,He is a good professor. He teaches well  although e dies stray off topic sometimes.
4.5,It's difficult for me to rate him accurately because I already knew everything covered in CS 100 so I found the class pretty boring. Prof Cohen was still pretty interesting though because he tends to go off on tangents  although that might have a negative impact on someone who doesn't know the material from which he is digressing.
4,Great teacher  knows his stuff and knows how to teach. People who complain are the ones who did not try and were playing games on their laptops in class.
1.5,Not a very understanding Prof. Seems very nice and very approachable but in reality he is totally the opposite. Take CS 103 instead CS 100!!
1,Unfortunately  the class does not use a book  and is introductory. So basically your as lost as you can be. He thinks he covers topics  but doesn't. Please  you love your GPA  do not try it!!!!
2.5,Doesn't do a good job teaching in class  so the homework assignments are very very difficult. Not very helpful either. Would not recommend.
4.5,Knows what he is talking about (since he is the head of the department). Kind of acts like he is all knowledgeable but you eventually understand that he is just good at what he does. Take him if you want to actually learn something instead of just going through the motions.
5,I had him for Molecular Evolution (Bioinformatics)  and I have to say  I was impressed. He spoke about Genetics and Evolution with the greatest of ease - pretty good for a CS Professor. Excellent Professor.
4.5,cis 113 became Java instead of C++ this semester. He was somewhat new to it and made mistakes while teaching  but a lot of profs do. Even though  he tried his best and he was a good teacher. The best is his practice problems right before an exam  which he goes over thoroughly. If you know how to solve them  you should do very well on exams
5,TAKE HIM FOR 113 AND 114!!KNOWS HIS STUFF!
5,No Comments
4.5,One of the best CIS professors. He explains very well.
4.5,He is a very good teacher. Explains thoroughly. Tries to help you in any way. Many corny jokes  makes more fun.
5,he's a gentleman. makes learning a new language like c++ very easy  which infact could be very difficult. Extremely helpful and nice guy. his jokes are not funny at all. take 113 with him
5,"his ""practice programming"" parts of his lecture will be on the commons. hes very nice and explains things to detail. take if you have no clue about c++"
4,Explains material well  easy grader.
1.5,although she clearly knows what she is talking about she is not clear when teaching. She acts as if you are stupid if you ask questions in class. The one good thing I have to say is that she is much nicer outside of class and gladly gives you help if you ask for it (only outside of class)
1,"She's horrible. She talks as if she's unsure of what she's about to say. She tells you  ""TRUST ME...I WILL LEAD YOU THERE."" She takes a VERY long time to get to her point. Her labs do not relate to what you're learning from the textbook. Class isn't mandatory  but she WILL yell at you and say you're a bad role model if you don't go. AVOID HER!!!!!!"
4.5,She's very intimidating/scary in class. But she's super helpful and a lot nicer in office hours. If she makes you feel stupid  get over it  that's just her style.
1.5,She is not direct and it takes her an hour to say a sentence.
1,Just plain BAD!!
1,Worst in the chem department...avoid her class if you can.
1,No Comments
5,She is difficult but you will learn a lot. She was very enthusiastic about biochemistry. Initially she is intimidating but once you ask her for help she will do everything to help you succeed. I would recommend her to anyone but be prepared to work hard.
2,Uninteresting and doesnxe2x80x99t bring the material to life
5,Dr. Specht is one of the best professors I've had. Some students find her intimidating  but she's actually very nice  especially if you see her out of class. She knows how to write questions that require you to think and apply what you know  as opposed to what you've memorized.
1,She's terrible
5,Great dry sense of humor. Expects lots from you  but you learn alot.
2.5,No Comments
2.5,Decent lecturer  but came off as very lazy (i.e. showing Frontline documentaries almost every class and giving the entire class a same grade on papers). Didn't reference the textbook once but gave a final based on stuff in it that he didn't come close to discussing in class... Frustrating! Don't dislike him personally  but not a good teach at all
3,Good background  interesting speaker.
1.5,Rudy lost me  when in class  said that only whites can be ****.
1,Race and Ethnicity is a class with a lot of potential  but Professor Pyle just didn't live up to that!
4,He may seem a bit off topic and pointless at times but he truely is a proffessor that lets the class do the teaching - he guides the conversations and discussions at times - at times does not - if the people are good  the class is good - if not  well  don't blame the professor - just read the book  do the assignments and participate in class.
4,Took this clas over the summer...was a breeze. The topics where interesting and i just really enjoyed the class. If u are unsure about the ratinngs take him over the summer and i garantee you will like it!
3,Not too bad
2.5,He starts out as a good prof  but as the semester progressed he got cranky and grouchy. The class seemed really pointless becasue we ended up watching a ton of movies. I would not reccoment taking a class from him if you can help it.
4,Professor Pyle is awesome. He's really relaxed in the classroom and tries to get people involved with his discussions. He's also willing to laugh at himself  and he realizes that people a long time ago forgot how to do that. But he still does. he's awesome!
2,His class seems pointless. Some of the assignments are confusing and he is not help at all :(
1,Actually said in class that blacks cannot be ****! News flash Rudy - all people are ****  even you! Suck it up  move on  work to improve  but live with that fact.
3.5,He's good stuff....a little odd  but alright in general (can be purdy funny at times as well).
2,No Comments
3,Professor Zacate is the type of professor where her instructions are pretty vague  so you need to make sure to ask as many questions as you need to  to get things cleared up. She gives out a lot of writing assignments which work towards the ten paged paper at the end of the semester for extra credit. She also doesn't explain the chapters often.
2,Nice  but not very specific on what is expected. She DOES NOT use canvas. She does not know anyone's grade unless you ask. And she will give you an estimate rather than figuring it out. You need to read the text often to prepare for reading quizzes. And when she lectures  she speaks in a monotone voice and reads from the book with no elaboration.
2,"I still don't understand why I had to take her class.. but don't. She does not explain anything  you're basically on your own  she gets mad or aggravated if you ask a question that does not go with what she's teaching that day. If you have a question she will make you wait until class ends or she simply says ""you should have asked me before class"""
1,If you have the option please stay away from her and any class she may teach. After one whole semester I did not learn one thing of value. She treats her class like it's going to be your major and runs it like a higher level course. Out of all my years in school Mrs. Zacate was hands down the worst teacher I've ever had. Would never take again.
1.5,Super passive-aggressive. Asked her simple questions and gets confused. Tried to dumb the question down and ask again and she still was confused. Not surprised a lot of people dropped. Quizzes and boring documentaries every week. would not take again!
1,Terrible at explaining. Gets highly confused over any questions. Most disorganized teacher I've ever had. Wastes most of the time in the course. Doesn't actually teach  just grades. Would have dropped this class after first class if I listened to my instincts. She should be fired. I love art and wanted to learn more  too bad I had to teach myself.
2.5,She's a good person but her teaching skills are not the best she will help you if you stay after class. It's very boring and she can barely hear. The tests are difficult but it's easy to get your grade up I had a D and the final brought me up to B with only 55 question right it was out of over 100 questions
2.5,"Professor Zacate's class is very easy and it is chock-full of extra credit. However  she doesn't teach very well and makes students do online ""tutorial quizzes"" about the book's content. You can keep redoing them until you get it right. She also seems to get flustered at any questions that doesn't fit right into her framework."
1.5,HORRIBLE teacher with no plans at all. She takes attendance at the beginning of class and also after break and she gives points for attendance. But that's not the problem  never clear on anything. You will be in the dark the entire course. She makes you watch old movies that has nothing to do with the course or tests  however  homework was easy
4,Pretty easy class. She takes attendance right at the start of class. Easy grader and gives extra credit. Show up to class and take good notes and you will get a good grade. Class is very boring but she knows art very well. Got an A in this class.
4,Easy class. Just show up and do the work. She doesn't grade hard and half your grade is basically homework and attendance. Tests are not hard either. Just take notes in class and you don't even need to read the book.
2,She's a tolerable enough woman but as a big fan of art  she bored even me to tears. You have to show up but if you bring a laptop  you can entertain yourself on Facebook the entire time. She'll let you use notecards and make sure you do the chapter quizzes and you'll be fine. BRING SOMETHING TO DO -- It's unspeakably boring.
2.5,Prepare to re-enter 5th grade! Attendence is taken EXACTLY at start of class if ur late at all points off takes attendence again after break if u leave points off heaven forbid u speak at all during her lecturing all these points are taken out of your grade I attended and got an A so i am not 1 of those irrate students just mad over a bad grade.
4,Eccentric  old-school teacher that actually has expectations of her class (GOD FORBID with Facebook generation). Will answer all your questions. Easy grader. Interesting class.
2,She was unrealistic about the expectations of her class! She wanted to cram and incredible amount of work into a 7 week summer course! I dropped her class after 1 day because she talked in circles and had a very strict attendance policy.
4,She is eccentric and boring  but very flexible  helpful and insightful...theclass waseasy
5,Betty keeps it real. dig the berets she dons. pay attention and show interest. old school teacher that lets you use notes for exams
4.5,i really enjoy this class
1,Worst teacher! Her method is very dry and boring  you do not actually learn anything. She actually made me hate art. Easy class  just read the book and zone her out if you must take it with her. I would advise against it. Plus she's a real jerk  to a lot of students over the smallest things  like being 20 seconds late. NO JOKE.
1,"This isnt a hard class  but this teacher makes it harder then it has to be. She gets flustered and confused when you ask her any questions. The test have material not covered in the lectures  and are horribly structured. Her power points are useless and she goes over things you need to know way to fast. Then she spends 30 minutes on ""enrichment""."
4.5,Kibbles is the man. He does make you do a lot of homework  which is extremely taxing  but is also really clear in lecture. If you wake up each day at 8:30 to listen to him talk  you should be fine.
4.5,Calculus III is hard - the material. But Mark makes it easier to understand the information by drawing and showing proofs (he is great at drawing 3-D graphs  by the way). His homework is always complex and makes you think really hard (applying). Usually takes me atleast 2 hours to complete his daily homework. But great teacher!
2,Pretty cool and funny teacher. He's hyper and silly even in class. But the workload is quite a lot to handle. Also a very hard course with homework everyday  about 3/4 projects during the semester. Take-home tests (which are hard!) The manual he sends out during the first week is NOT helpful at all. He isn't that helpful either.Maybe that's just me
5,McKibben is the man! Though I think he is a little too smart. Sometimes I have trouble following his thought process which is lightning fast so us slower beings tend to get lost on the first try.
2.5,Nice man  but the material was just too hard. He was such a mathematical genius that he couldn't find a way to teach it to idiots like me who only took it for requirements. Recommend Basic Math for those who can't do math real good.
5,Mark is a great teacher. He spells all the material out with crystal clarity and can answer any question. That being said  he's so brilliant that it was really hard for those of us that are only so good at Calc to keep up and understand the material. Calc II wasn't like a normal Calc course  it was intense. I spent a lot of time prepping for exams.
4.5,Holy Cow! This class was insane. But I recommend Godel  Escher  Bach Frontiers because it's an incredibly interesting class -- probably only because Mr. McKibben teaches it. Works really hard to help us understand everything. Great comments -- makes you want to do well in his class.
5,What can I say? He's great. I'll take any course he's teaching simply because he rules so much as a professor.
5,Very enthusiastic  brilliant (ask him about his NASA project someday)  sense of humor  challenges you with the material but willing to talk it through
4,Mark gets pretty excited over Calc its funny. He does a really good job of staying upbeat and energetic even when my class was dead tired and I was nursing a hangover. The courseload is challenging but he helps you if you ask for it.
5,mark is great. his only real flaws are that he can be a bit too smart for his own good and his clothes are all too tight.
5,Great teacher. Absolutely one of the best teachers I have ever had. He attempts to make things creative and challenging while also making sure we are learning.
5,Very effusive teaching  clearly loves teaching. Upbeat  very good at answering questions  homework makes you think  puts A LOT of work into the course  excellent at explaining concepts  best math teacher I've ever had.
5,Mark is the BEST. He loves challenging people  but is always available to help. He goes out of his way to make sure everybody does the very best possible and learns LOTS.
1,WORST PROFESSOR EVER! I have never had anything below an A in English and I have a D. I have never been so dissappointed in a professor in my life. She is terrible and she is very mean and often comes off as rude. She calls people out and she tears them apart. shes like a vicious DRAGON. she skipped class more than I did and were way behind.
1,Awful
1,Get a new Prof.
4,Hey  I got a B  shes not that bad
3,"An honest (yet sometimes hard hitting) professor who excels at making you put effort into work at the things you need to accomplish for the class. Do not expect to go in for an ""Easy A""  and do not expect there to be special treatment. You do the work  you earn your grade. Whether it's good or bad  that's on you. Read. Don't mess around."
3,Prof. Dearing isn't a bad teacher. Things to note about her class: 6 absences bring you down a letter grade. Being late by 10 minutes 4 times counts as an absence. The final paper isn't accepted late  not even later that day. She teaches grammar and essay structure. If you want to read poems and analyze symbolism  this isn't the class for you.
4,She takes off a final letter grade for every 6 classes missed so don't skip too offen. Her quizzes are easy grade boosters and she teaches pretty straight to the book. If you're bad at English you might struggle a little bit  however she's a hardass  and though her expectations are clear  she grades tough. I would take her again if I had to.
1,"This is the worst teacher at hvcc. DO Not take her class. she is not a good teacher at all. she does not help. she does not give any good advise. drinks coffee and chocolate bars all class. grades really tough my friend told me to drop her before school started and i should have listened. absolute worst ""professor""out there."
1,Do NOT  and I repeat  DO NOT take this woman's class. Never in my adolescent life have I stressed so much about any academic subject but this course is absolutely abysmal. The teacher tries to be funny but often comes off as very condescending. There is very little passion in the class which makes it that much harder to sit through.
4,She's nice  but a tough grader. You have to do all the work and keep up or you will fail.
1,I have never had a professor who was more vague on what she wanted from us when it came to assignments. The only student who got above a C was the girl who got Dearing a fifty dollar gift-card to D&D. This teacher does not care about her students and her lectures never matched up to what we read in the text books. Avoid her at all costs.
4,Professor Dearing's class is definitely not easy but she is without a doubt a great teacher. You really have to work for a good grade and attendance is mandatory to pass. Overall she was very helpful though  and wants success for her students. I would not recommend this class if you don't like reading. She also was very helpful with writing papers.
1,Very unpleasant instructor. I immediately dropped her class after the third day of having to sit in her classroom. Miserable. Also the first thing she assigned was to write a biography about our personal lives and then present it orally in front of the class on the third day  awkward. Expect reading due every class and numerous essays & tests.
4.5,Makes you work but is very riveting at lecture.
3,She was not there for the first two days of class and most of the majority of the semester. But she's very strict with absences for students which I think is stupid and makes her a hypocrite. She's very rude and egotistical. She's a grader nazi so don't expect to get an A. Overall  I recommend you don't take her and just leave her class now.
3,"Grades really hard. I do not recommend. Did not enjoy this class what so ever and felt really discouraged. On one of my descriptive essays we had to do for class  she wrote ""too much description"". I'm sorry what?? Awful"
1,AVOID HER!!!!!!!!! I couldn't stand her!!! She thinks she is funny but she isn't!!! I wish she is dead!!!!
2.5,Devote your life to her class  work hard  make many sacrifices and you will still not smell the paradise of an A. Only thing I liked about her class was before the research project.
3,"I withdrew from her class. She is super tough and the class average can be between the C and D range at times. A lot of writing is expected in and out of class and is super strict about grammar and MLA format  one mistake and you are done. The class went down to about 8 students from being full when I withdrew. She ""tries"" to be funny."
2,Don't do it. No! RUN! Find another professor. Took comp 2 online. She never gives a grade higher than a B. Really I asked her. She said it's very rare she gives an A unless its advanced college work. Go to the next professor.
2,I took his class for an easy A. I have a background in Finance as my family has been in different financial and investment fields for decades. It was an easy class.. if you agree with him. As a licsenced broker with 3 years of experience  I disagreed with some of the things he said. It wasn't a boring class  though.
5,Funny guy. Never stopped laughing. afternoon class never felt like it though. really good class.
5,Laughed the whole time. Doesn't make a late afternoon class seem so BLAH! Funny Funny guy! Definately reccomend him. Can be a little disorganized but doesn't interfere with the learning.
3,he is all over the place and disorganized but very fun to be in classs with. As though he took in too many caffene pills before class.
5,Useful for all majors  little unorganized  but easy and knowledgable
4,everyone should take class  makes it easy for none FIN students.
4.5,Favorite Class and Favorite Prof. Most useful class I've EVER taken. FUNNY
1.5,Wants everyone to do things his way  Unfortunately the wrong way
5,I learned more useful stuff in this class than any other class. Great Prof.

1,Belittles his students. Class not worth taking.
1,Bad class  worse teacher
1,No sympathy for students. Worthless teacher.
1,Worthless class and teacher. Should pick another profession.
1,Belittles his students. Appears nice  but he doesn't care about his students.
3.5,Energetic and fast-paced. Good if you can keep up. Good luck if you can't.
5,I miss Dr. Nina so much. I am so honored to have sung under her.
5,Nina is the greatest choir director I've ever had. She cares about everyone's input and does everything she can to get the best sound out of us possible. In order to pass  you have to show up - but that's a given in choir. And if you have too many absences  she offers extra credit by attending festival choir. Amazing person and professor! Love her
5,Nina is absolutely amazing. She's got a great sense of humor  is very easygoing  and loves what she does. She's so energetic - she's what makes choir so great. Just be sure to show up to class and learn the music  and you're golden.
5,I am a recent graduate  and Nina was my saving grace at CMU. She provided creative outlets through choir  and challenged me to be the great musician that I became over my years as a vocal student. I had several voice teachers  but Nina was the one that taught me the most about music and responsibility. Do yourself a favor and join her choirs.
4.5,"Nina is my favorite professor in the school of music. Whoever says ""Don't take this class"" is likely someone who is not that great of a singer but was pampered in high school. You don't have to be the best singer to be in choir  but you have to be willing to try  and work hard. I have never seen Nina be rude towards a student and Im a junior with h"
4,I'm not going to do choir again  but I did enjoy the class. Nina's great and if you're a music major  you'll love her.
2,I love choir but after taking it with Nina  I will not be taking it again. She sucks the fun out of the class. I felt like I went backwards in my training. She prefers young sounding voices and has obvious favorites. She is incredibly rude to her students and thinks that what she says is the law. DO NOT TAKE CHOIR WITH HER!
5,Ok  not the most amazing conducting ive seen  but i was spoiled at my previous college. I dont think she spends enough time with concert and i think she does play faves sometimes...but who doesnt. I like her  and am interested to see how my years at CMU play out
4.5,Nina is the coolest person ever! I loved taking her class and I loved the music we got to sing. It was great!
3.5,She has her favorites  we do the same music all year long  she talks badly about students quite often. She is ok part of the time  other times he is a completely horrible person
3,Personally  I think she puts to much time into other choirs and not Concert Choir. Choir was horrible because of this  and not to mention we sang all the same songs the whole year.
5,Nina is a great choir director  and an amazing woman!
4.5,Nina is a GREAT person  but the coir was just okay... I've had better expereinces and singing the same songs all semester sucks. But you gain some great friends and you get to sing  so no complaining.
5,Taught me more about music than I ever thought I would get to learn. Very enthusiastic about her job and her students. Take choir classes with her.
1.5,Not even going to go there
3,"The chorus was kind of a let down only because of previously amazing experiences. Don't let ""trying out"" keep you from any music classes at CMU. It's very relaxed and friendly. The class was fun and challenging. Attendance makes your grade or not (not hard at all)Kind of confusing direction at times"
5,Great prof.
3,Nina is a wonderful person and has a deep passion for music. But I hated this class because we sang the same 4 songs all semester. It's also 5 days a week and 1 credit hour.
4.5,It is inspiring for future music educators to observe choral teaching and conducting at it's best. Nina embodies what choral music is.
5,Best teacher and nicest woman ever. She will do anything she can to help. :)
2,He was alright  some of the lectures weren't all that clear and sometimes he seemed a little unenthusiastic but not bad
5,Christian is like a wizard. It takes him 3 months to teach what the math department takes 2 courses  2 profs  and 8 months to teach (poorly). Truly magical!
5,Super helpful and very clear in his lecture and in his email. Very nice proff. and I would totally take another course with him again if I could.
5,Really good proof and very clear in his lecture. Assignments and exams are fair. Very nice and helpful.
3.5,Nicest prof! really makes you think about the concepts. Reading online class notes will help a lot.
4,A really good teacher!
1,thinks hes better than he is.
5,the best prof ever
5,Christian is great! Take anything you can with him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Christian is awesome! The best prof that I have had here at UBC so far! Very helpful  great class  fun and interesting lectures. He is very fair  and doesn?t like conventional teaching methods  rather he will teach you why something is the way it is. Thanks Christian  loved your class!
3,Nice guy  really easy. His in class notes aren't the greatest  but his handouts are good.
3.5,No Comments
4.5,A very smart guy. He knows well what he's teaching. Very open to questions. Clear notes.
4.5,I think he's a first time instructor  but he's really nice and tries hard to make us understand. Very willing to help and always looking for feedback on class.
1,Kristine is one of the worst professors I've had. Incredibly full of herself  and teaches her opinions like they're fact. She's also technologically illiterate and wastes time trying to figure out the simplest things. Tests have confusing questions and she expects us to teach ourselves the material outside of class. Avoid!
2.5,She isn't the worse  but lecture is sometimes all over the place. She is technologically challenged  and she jumps back and forth through topics  so it can be hard to take notes.
3,Kristine is an alright professor. She can be a little off sometimes and she forgets to put discussion questions up on ICON a lot. For exams  you'll need to focus more on examples rather than the actual definitions. The exams aren't super hard  but I learned the hard way for the first half of the test. : The papers are short (2 to 3 pages)  hard.
4.5,Kristine is extremely invested in what you take out of her class  and I really enjoyed the class much more then I expected to  considering I am not a Communications Major. Definitely take a class from her if you can!
5,Fitch (aka Munoz)invests a lot of time and effort into teaching. Although the course material is abstract  she explores both the simple and complex aspects  creating depth of understanding. Her review chats online and discussion sections prepare students for the tests. A great class if you're willing to study and come to lecture.
4.5,"Normally I hate my comm studies classes  but Kristine is funny  understanding  helpful  and smart. She truly cares about her students and the material she teaches. I wouldn't say her class is either easy or hard  but she challenges you in a way that makes you want to do well. I took her ""advanced topics in comm studies"" and it's a great class!"
4,She was very nice and the class was extremely helpful in teaching me new and interesting things.
4,Kristine is a nice lady who tries to make things fun (plays a song before each class and relates it to lecture) and goes the extra mile to help (has open Q&A chats online right before tests). Posts lecture slides on ICON. You don't need to buy a clicker like she says you do.
1.5,Not making clear or very logic point. You feel like you know every word she says  but it just make little sense. Not helpful in understanding the major. Need redesign.
5,Wonderful at *teaching* - well planned lessons  good organization  interesting and compelling.
3,Challenges but supports
2,She is incredibly moody and unfriendly to some graduate students for whatever reason. If you are not her favorite  she will not smile when she sees you. And if she is knowledgeable or an in your face feminist  then she needs to be more friendly so that students will want to find out what she is all about. I wouldn't want to study with her!
4,Fitch is quite knowledgable. Get on her good side and pay attention to details. Go to section. Write your papers very straight forward. Those are graded by your TA so suck up to them
2.5,Ugh...she was odd. Her tests were hard. The sections were easy but pointless. Assignments were very easy. Didn't go class half the time and made a B-
4.5,Kristine really knows what she is talking about in Communication Studies. She does a good job at giving a brief overview of all the basic important topics in Comm. Studies  but also does a good job of making sure people understand them. Tests aren't very hard and if you are able to take the honors section  that's the best way to go!
1.5,Its mostly commonsense and she even makes that boring. Unfortunatly you HAVE to take this to get in the major but she sucks.
1.5,reeeeaal snippy
1,yikes!
2,Unhelpfull and just not interested in student's
1,"boring and confusing lectures and not friendly when you go to office hours. unavailable to student's needs unless you are a ""chosen one"" that she likes"
4,Loved this class. No nonsense approach to teaching - conveys the critical information and explains its significance and application. Would take Labour Law again with him in heartbeat!
4.5,He does an awesome job with a course that lends itself to being boring and hard to work with. You might be able to learn more if you took this class with a judge  but this guy definitely does a great job and relates concepts to reality very well.
5,He's awesome. One of the best prof's i've had thus far. Made one REALLY DRY COURSE...one of the most interesting i've taken. GO TO LECTURE AND YOU DON'T NEED TO READ!!!
5,Always has a joke to tell  but wants you to learn and understand what he's teaching you - so it's a nice balance of work of play. He explains things clearly  and uses great examples to help you understand. Awesome professor!
5,He's hilarious. Works magic with a very very dry subject. Also cute  and gives away $ on occasion...
5,So cute and oh so young.
5,Excellent prof. Very clear and thorough. You won't need to do the readings.
5,Civil Procedure is boring as hell  but since you have to take it  pick McNevin...he's funny and will make the material interesting
4.5,Never physically met her  but she responed to emails promptly. I enjoyed the class  we used the test and the tests came right from that. Make sure to study for exams  lots of memorization and cover a lot of material.
3.5,Internet course- never saw test grades  portfolio or observ. journal grades posted in Eagle. Very vague syllabus and poor instructions for largest point assignments and offered little to no help in clarifying it. Very frustrated at the slowness (or lack of) answers to questions sent via email. Not recommended for an internet course.
4.5,She is a very nice and helpful teacher although  this class is ridiculous. The test are hard because it is all memorization and you don't know what will be on the tests. I would like this class better if it wasn't so hard. Very relaxed class. You get a lot of good input from this class with cool art projects Class stunk  but good outcome.
5,thank you
5,I didn't think the tests were hard as long as you study! All the tests are essay  but all you have to do is study your homework questions which can be a lot. I liked it because I felt like I got my moneys worth. You actually have to work for your grade!! I enjoyed it looking forward to my summer class with Mimi.
4,Tests are extremely hard because it is total memorization  she is a great professor and very resourceful.
3.5,She has good teaching techniques  but if you have problems memorizing information this is definatley not the class for you. Granted I am doing well in the class  but its all from guessing pretty much. Alot of the material contains material from recent chapters. The art activities are great though!
5,Mimi Fagan rocks! She's a great teacher  lots of fun  and helpful.
4,"Mrs.****an allows students to work together on projects most class periods - she takes this information and arranges tests. Tests are very difficult - all memorization and listing. ""List the ten steps to..."" List Erikson's... Piaget's  Kohlberg'"
4.5,AMAZING PROFESSOR!!! His expertise within the subject matter is beyond this world! He lectures only for 1.5 hrs and the rest of the 3 hour lecture he allows for group work. His teaching method is nothing that you will expect  but even though he relies on a lot of independent studying and research it pays off! This method is very effective.
1,Avoid at all costs! His lectures consist of him reading from essays he probably wrote 20 years ago. There is little to no direction for assignments. There was no proper syllabus. You are given three thick reading kits and left to decide what to read on your own. This is a prof who should've retired ten years ago.
4.5,He is a great professor. Willing to challenge conventional means of teaching and he is extremely brilliant. Granted  he demands you know a bit more than you should coming into the class  but it is a 3000 level course after all. Very lenient and enjoys teaching. He constantly makes you realize that you are capable of my more. Great class overall.
5,Has to be one of the best Can hist profs at York. Very easy going  great lectures  really intellegent. Knows his history in an out. Willing to help even outside of class. Doesn't follow university protocol  which makes it even easier to work with him! Loved the class and great prof!
3.5,A very intelligent man within his field of study. Not the best lecturer. He seems somewhat out of touch with the modern university system. He has an amusing tendency to glorify himself within his lectures.
5,Just brilliant.
5,No Comments
5,Not only this Professor Stevens the best Professor at York University  but he's the most articulate and most calculated with his words. Will not bore you with social and cultural history. 10/10!
5,He is such a monotone speaker. I felt like sleeping ever day in his class. But his assignments and grading schemes are amazing. You can ask him any question and he will help you until you feel comfortable with the material. Other than his boring way of lecturing  he is a great professor. One of the best I had
5,He is a great Prof. who knows what he is talking about. the class will fly by
2,Most insane teacher ever. Reminds me of John Malkovitch (complete with sleep-inducing voice). He came to class less than I did  but is still the sweetest prof ever. Your entire grade is basically given at the end  but he's lenient. Never again though.
4.5,A great prof. Very approachable. Will always make time for you outside of class. A VERY fair marker. Classes are relaxed.
2,He sucks! No guidance or structured lectures. I only know 25% of my mark so far and it's March!!Almost forgot  he's always absent and doesn't give students prior notice.
1,This man was TERRIBLE. Why is he teaching? He knows lots  sure  but so BORING and no direction to his students at all. It was like he was trying to get us to fail!!
4,Excellent teacher - expects a lot from his students but is so inspirational.
5,Does Knofel read these...He was one of my professors at OBC...Judy Greer McAllister

4.5,He's amazing. the only thing i don't like is the boring reading assignments
1.5,I just feel he is set in his ways  and untouchable. He is great when it comes to preaching and getting a class excitted and motived. But when it comes to helping a student who may require extra time and slow the class down he gets frustrated. He assumes that student doesnt take the class seriously or study. He will offer to help but I would wonder if would expect the student to change to his stlye of learning. Not everyone learns the same. Tactile visual  auditory.
4.5,"i still remember when staton jumped on the table or picked on the girl in the front row as his ""girlfriend"".. this guy is truly a great teacher. Funny & lively. the perfect class o wake u up!"

4.5,Great prof. Amazing talent for teaching. Unreal enthusiasm. And super easy grader!
4.5,I have often referred to him as my hero. He is like a cross between a fire ant and papa smurf!
5,No Comments
5,He makes the Bible come alive. If you have not had him as a teacher  you are missing out on some great lovelism!
5,Amazingly intelligent. He lectures from memory and knows something about pretty much everything. His course was truly fascinating. Only problem is that he made his exams years ago  and doesn't change them to what he actually taught this year  but in the end hes an easy grader and weighs the percents of each piece of your grade in your favor.
4,Super interesting man  super interesting class. It was my first Anthropology class  and I learned so much. He is really knowledgeable and has the coolest stories to tell. There is only a midterm and a final  so it isnt that hard of a class at all.
5,John Burton is by far the best professor I have had at this college. I plan to ask him to be my adviser  and because of his teaching I have decided to major in Anthropology. He supplements his class with his own studies and so he is a master of the material. If you want an easy class that will expand your mind give it a try!
4.5,Very good storyteller  chooses a wide variety of texts and is extremely animated  making for a good lecture. Sometimes a little low on class discussions.
2.5,Anthro 245? Don't do it. You'll just watch movies and probably learn nothing. And then the class ends up being pretty hard.
5,Amazing professor. Love his tight jeans and boots - love his discussion of cows even more.
4,you dont really have to go to class  but you should always get the notes because you will need them. wacky grading system. your whole grade is the midterm and the final. nothing else. ya...stress
5,An excellent class. John Burton is a phenomenal professor. This class will open your eyes and change your perspective of the world around you.
2,No Comments
4.5,His classes are AMAZING...I highly reccommend him...Difficult to get in touch with  though. Sometimes doesn't keep appointments/respond to e-mails.
5,How did an intro class change my life?
5,great class
5,Prof. Burton is an amazing professor. I loved every class I had with him - especially language & symbolism and theory in anthropology. He is a great guy - still helpful after graduation - even though I switched careers and moved away from anthro.
5,an incredible professor and one of the most intellegent in the entire school.
5,John Burton is a first rate professor and a superb anthropologist. His language and symbolism class made me decide to major. Eloquent  smart  with a wry sense of humor. Highly recommend Africa course too. Treats students as young anthropologists and never talks down. Can't recommend him enough!
4,My favorite teacher this semester. Burton's stories are interesting and easy to follow. He's very approachable and understanding  so no worries about talking to him after class. You respect him right off the bat for his knowledge and experience in the field. Class gets our early often.
4,Can get boring as an early class but if you can bave the time than its def worth it. Surprisingly tough grader on the minimal amount of work assigned.
5,"John Burton is an amazing storyteller and a very funny guy. He started off one of his lectures with ""the first time i had malaria..."" I liked one day when he put away his notes and told stories the whole time. Dance major in college  no less..."
4.5,He's very intelligent and knows what he's talking about because he's done fieldwork in the past. He's sort of intimidating but friendly if you talk to him one on one.
4,He was everything you would want a college professor to be extremely intelligent  fascinating and a bit arogant all at the same time.
4.5,Mrs. Leach runs the Practical Nursing program  and teaches the harder classes. Sure  she is HARD on you  but she expects a lot from you because nursing is a career where you must weed out those not cut out for the job. As I am now working on my BSN I still fall back on things she taught me in class. Respect her. Not all care about you like she does
5,Kay Leach is a great instructor. I wish that more instructors are like her!She is the best.
4.5,No Comments
1.5,"Very biased  quickly picking her ""pets""  and discriminating against those students that she does not like!"
5,Dr. Tompkins teaches for understanding  not memorization. Come to class  participate and pay attention. Hi lecture videos are exactly what he taught in class so if you don't understand something  watch it until you get it. His quizzes are short  but difficult. I cannot stress enough how important coming to class and paying attention are.
5,Genuinely difficult professor to navigate  but that is mostly because he tries to make sure you understand the material  which his quizzes and exams directly reflect. Do not bother skipping class because he teaches directly from his powerpoints and will quiz you accordingly. Really tried and still made a 79.5. Yeah  and he doesn't round up either.
5,Great professor! Taking him in the summer is more difficult to manage tho. Would recommend him for regular semesters.
4,"Tompkins is a very good teacher who cares about you UNDERSTANDING not memorizing the material. His youtube videos are extremely helpful  but his tests and quizzes are extremely challenging and quite difficult. He does not care about your grade and makes it nearly impossible to get an ""A"" in his class. Too much information to learn for a 4 week clas"
4,If you're too lazy to go to class  study  this is not a course for you. If you are willing to be challenged and (god forbid) learn something  you'll do fine. As long as you work hard (go to every class and start studying for exams way ahead of time) you will be fine. Deep breaths. Relax
1,This prof cares more about hearing himself talk than your education. My peers busted their butts for B's  and the B is with a curve. On exams  show him exactly the way he shows you. If not  you are wrong. The biggest barrier to your success will be giving Tompkins what he wants the way he wants it. It's not learning the material.
4,He is not that hard if you just want to pass. 6 quizzes are 85% of your grade  but they are only few questions each. He grades purely on the curve. His teaching style is to give you a solid understanding of the material which enables you to pass any test he throws at you. He has lectures on YouTube  which REALLY help. Very light workload.
4,Really great and caring teacher. Offers videos of all lectures so that you can study. He wants you to understand the material and is ALWAYS willing to meet for extra help. Prefers to call you on the phone to answer questions over emailing. Tough grader but completely fair.
4,Good prof. Cares and gives you multiple opportunities to succeed. Always willing to answer questions outside of class. My first class with him. Tests are hard  but watch the videos. Go to class and pay attention because it helps you learn. Definitely would take him again! Not an easy class though.
1,Very hard class. Does not use textbook. Wants you to learn to derive formulas you will not ever use
5,Great professor and hilarious. I'd recommend taking him in the fall though. Taking him in the summer  four days a week is tougher to manage.
4,Tompkins is an amazing teacher. He wants to ensure that you understand everything to the nth degree. His class was one of the hardest classes I have ever taken. That being said  Tompkins knows this and expects a lot but gives a lot of help. He has his own Youtube channel with his lectures to assist in studying. Study and practice a lot****
4,He's engaging  his lectures are great. I enjoyed his class and the way he teaches.
5,He is just a great Professor and do not hesitate to take his course. explains things well.
5,Great professor. Smart  sharp  understanding. Always willing to answer questions. I took two of his classes during the summer. Tests are hard  study the lectures. Pay attention in class
5,I took him for Fall 2013 class. Dr.Tompkins is a Talented Professor with unique teaching style. Starting from our class  he started providing audio powerpoint presentations which turned out to be very helpful. Tests are very challenging  so pay attention to everything he says. Grade consists of a Midterm  Final or Group project and five quizzes.
4,I took this professor for a maymester and he was incredibly nice and made what could be a boring class interesting. He is very discussion based so you have to be willing to participate. Grades easily on group project but tests can definitely be tricky and difficult if you don't prepare! He really tries to help you understand the material though!
5,Very good professor with an interesting teaching style. Tests are not that hard if you understand the material and pay attention to everything he says in class. He will always answer any questions by making you answer it  so be ready. Grade consists of a midterm  final  three quizzes and an optional group project. Take him if you enjoy finance.
5,This class covers: corporate growth  debt & equity financing  and dividends. These topics are not taught in other courses. There are five projects. The math is not hard. Explaining the formulas can be difficult. Exceptional professor! Exceptional course!
5,If you want to learn  take Tompkins. He covers more material and in greater detail than other professors. He is challenging. The projects are time consuming  but are graded easily. The quizzes are hard  but are representative of the test. Do well on the mid-term and you're set.
2,She is not a strong teacher. I did not learn very much in her class. She disrespects graduate students. If you are looking into graduate school  avoid applying to this professor.
4,Get ready for a hand cramp! Lynn is a great prof cause she knows her stuff  is clear  and organized but she doesn't post notes on UR courses or Web CT and will fly through the slides in class. There was so much material in this class  19 chapters on the final and all comprehensive. Expectations for a 200 level class were a bit high.
2.5,ALOT OF MATERIAL and the final is culmative which doesn't really help..the tests arent hard just too much to know and she doesn't explain the tests/assigments that well..
5,Very thorough  lots of much appreciated structure
3,She explained things well  but her tests were very hard. There is A LOT of material to cover in the class (no matter who teaches it). Her final was comprehensive  which made it very difficult considering the amount of information you learn in the calss.
5,Her class is very interesting. She has funny examples and encourages class participation. She has a down-to-earth approach. She's not a proff that acts like she knows all the answers - a breath of fresh air. I would recommend her. Didn't give any assignments  just exams.
1.5,She is a very hard marker. Her tests are really hard. Be prepared to read the whole 19 chapters of the text she finishes a chapter in 2 days.
4,She is a hard marker  but if you ask her what she wants you will see an improvement in your mark. I would take another class from her  there were no surprises.
2.5,Too many notes. I trippled the amount of my notes from any other 300 level course. Tests are not overly hard  but they are long and not enough time is given to complete them. Difficult marker. She seems nice and knows a lot  but needs more experience.
4,She is a great person. Very interested in what she does. Tries to make class exciting. Her exams are fair. Just figure out what she wants and your fine. Be prepared to have a sore hand. Lots and lots of notes goes through really really fast.
3.5,If you go to class her tests aren't too bad. For essays though watch out she is a tough marker. We did cover lots of information in a short time but a lot of it was common sense so it wasn't that hard. I'd take another class from her.
3,Lots of work  lots of material to cover in a short time. Poor teaching style (only uses powerpoint slides) but possesses a great deal of knowledge. Tough exams and tough marker - Beware!
1.5,A bit to 'tee-hee' ditzy to be teaching at a university
5,chriss hood is rad
5,No Comments
4.5,He's funny and always makes time for his students outside of class
5,Best writing instructor I have ever had!!! His conferences will help your writing skill improve drastically.
4,Talks very quietly and drones but what he's saying is easy to understand. Which is good for me since I suck at econ. He's very patient and explains what he wants out of you so it's not hard to get good grades. Very nice to students so long as you are nice back.
2,Worst professor I have had at Conn. hard to pay attention to  doesn't explain anything and expects us to understand right away. Problem sets are hard and graded hard. Do not take his class if you are interested in Econ  it is extremely frustrating
3.5,Pay attention and take notes in class and you will do well no problem. Tests are problems discussed in class
5,Lecturs are hard to get through at times. But are very clear and tests are straight forward.
5,hes my boy
4,fair grader  goes into great detail on every subject  take notes and tests will be no problem. his personality can be tough to handle for long periods of time.
2.5,Professor V. is a little boring and solely lectures the class and once in a while picks a person out to answer a question on the spot. However  he is very fair. He always rounds up. He definitely does not move too fast. Every class begins with a review of the last class.
1,Napoleon Complex Jerk. Should not be allowed to keep teaching. Most unfair grades in history. Prof. with this many psych. probs should have been retired long ago.
3,He's amusing  but I find it very difficult to feel engaged in the classroom. He also does not take the time to learn ANYONE'S names.
2,He goes way too fast in class and is pretty unclear. I think he has just been teaching for too long and has forgotten how to teach and that we don't all know everything already.
4,As an IR major  I was required to take 3 econ classes. Of the 3 that I took  only one was even slightly educational--that was Intro to Micro with Visgilio. He is a straight shooter and is totally reasonable and fair. Great guy and professor!

5,He's a real good prof. Extremely helpful and friendly... A fair grader  sure enough. The class was very helpful  and the prof was even more helpful. Gives extensive comments on assignments... He really wants people to learn in his class... Sometimes a bit monotonous  but still manages to keep you interested... girls watch out for his sly smile!!!
4.5,Great prof
4.5,Good professor. Interesting material and insight. Drones a little at times  but generally keeps the attention of the class. Allows for discussion which is helpful. Assignments and tests are graded fairly and Prof. Bush is there to help however he can.
5,his insight is brilliant really intriging  makes you think and draws you into a deeper understandings.you will gain SO much out of this class will make you think diffrently about the diversity of narratives.he's pretty sexy also has this sly smile on his face  so if you get a tad bored  you can occupy your mind with him.really great guy in general
5,All I can say is he's an amazing professor. Gives thorough insight into the readings so you don't feel like they were pointless like in other courses. A genuinely nice  friendly and approachable guy. Always smiled when I handed in a test or essay to him.
4.5,Really great as a individual...will say hi on the street and know your name. Some times very monotone  but you wont be able to hold it against him cause you like him so much.

5,An amazing prof. He gives great insight into every work we studied  which were all very interesting. He is very involved with the course and does way more than any other prof at U of T. Definitely the most eloquent man I've ever met! Fabulous!!!!
4,A little monotonous...but he knows his stuff
4,Really intelligent and gives great insight into the material. He tries to get the class involved which is great. i love his extensive vocabulary and use of the english language!
4,Smart guy  and a good teacher. The only problem with his class is that his voice gets sort of... droning  which can lead to sleepiness. The material he assigns is interesting and relevant  and he explains it quite well. What's up with the undershirts

2.5,Murphy always talks about football and never mentions anything about biology. He has confusing lectures but I will admit that his powerpoint short video presentations are ok. His test are very hard and if you play football he will pass you reguardless so unless your an athlete I dont reccomend this class.
1,This teacher is full of himself and his family...he talks about his two sons all the time. His quizzes and test are super tricky  during lecture he goes offtopic all the time.Bio is hard enough and he only makes it worse.
1,I've never had a teacher pass out so many papers. This is strange for a environmental guy. In average lecture  approximately 25% of what is said is repeated stories/ insights that you hear everyday rest is confusing assignments. Not nice at all.
5,Rambles a lot but does not give tests. Show up  do the assignments and you can get an A
5,As long as you do your work you will pass. He talks a lot and does not give tests (bio 11) You dont need to take notes at all. Just Be on time and dont be absent. He is very good about helping and explaining..Does contract class.
4.5,"He's a good guy. Be on time and do your work. Bio 11 is a great class especially for those of us that are ""biology challenged"". It focuses on environmental issues. If you make an effort - Murphy will help you pass with whatever grade you contrac"
1.5,was not helpful at all spend all that money on the book and didnt even need it. lectures where boring and not relavent to the hard test.

1,He enjoys talking about his many degrees....and about how great he is....then why is he teaching at long beach city?....honestly...come on now....self absorbed low life
5,Wonderful professor. Truly cared that you learn and his efforts show it.
5,Professor Tony Hage is an AMAZING instructor I strongly recommended him  very passionate  explains in detail  making complex info.  easy to understand  shwd short cut  go above and beyond to help students  plenty of reviews & materials  available before & after class  3exams  labs  & a final. Overall  an excellent professor! I would take him agai
5,am really i took your class  what a blessing  he taught like an african teacher from Ghana. he will make u love chemistry. oh my God he doesnt run from questions. his in class lecture notes are the best. am done with the class but i have his lectures still in memory. i will take u again for pleasure just to be good with calculations. dont miss him
5,I WILL SAY THAT HE IS THE BEST TEACHER I HAVE EVR HAD SINCE I CAME TO THE UNITED STATES. HE IS VERY ATTENTIVE AND THOROUGH WITH HIS TEACHING. TO ADD TO IT ALL HE IS VERY CONSIDERATE.I THINK HE IS A REAL GEM AND HE HAS MADE ME A CHEMISTRY LOVER! GOOD JOB PROFESSOR! KEEP IT UP!
5,Great professor! He is very passionate about chemistry and will explain it as many times as you need so you understand it! I would definitely take a course taught by him again! If you listen and try then you can easily get an A .
5,HAHA did i say easy A  he never runs from a question. he encourages more questions. he simplifies all the material. his tests are written problem solving. but you'll get a question that wasn't discussed in class over 4 times. I know slow students who made it in his class so because he was willing to help
5,Fantastic teacher  obviously passionate about the subject  and passionate about teaching. He is very good at making complex information easily digestible. He has been teaching the course for decades  and he has it down to a science (no pun intended). I'd love to take another of his courses if I could. Bonus: his personality is unique and fun.
5,hes brilliant. he explains in detail. makes it look easy. its bviously chemistry no easy As.. u have to put in the work. but he makes it look easy. try not to skip class
5,Toni Hage helps you understand Chemistry. He is there for you  if you want to learn. Tests are not multiple choice  so you must know your material. All the material is covered in the lectures.
5,great teacher. he is clear and he explains step by step. he is the best teacher ever. I love his class I hope he can teach my 1113. he covers the all book and I don't need to buy it. Mr. Tony the best teacher ever.
5,One of the best professors I have ever had.
5,Professor Hage is awesome. Take his class  I drive 45 minutes to get to class but I do not regret it. His notes are very clear and his test are based on his notes. If you study your notes before test you would pass his class with a good grade.
5,"Tony is an amazing teacher! For those students who don't understand the ""hype"" it is because some of us just don't get Chemistry but he makes us feel like it comes naturally. I dropped another professor & tacked on extra miles to be in his class & would do it again! I REALLY hope he considers teaching Organic Chem!! TAKE HIS CLASS!"
4.5,Professor Hage is an AMAZING Instructor. He not only has great analogies for learning chemistry but also gives plenty of review and instruction for his students. Hage made himself available prior toafter class for specific questions over lecture material I wasn't clear on . **In class participation goes a long way with Professor Hage!
3.5,Tony is a competent professor. His lectures are understandable and he answers questions in a mostly clear manner. However  one thing that was annoying to me was how he bragged every other week about his amazing ratings on this website  and the awards he got from the school because of them. No offense  but he certainly does not live up to the hype.
5,Tony Hage is hands-down one of the best teachers I've ever had  if not THE best. I hadn't taken chemistry in probably 14 years (graduated HS a long time ago)  so the fact that I did so well is a testament to his teaching ability. He breaks things down so they are easy to understand  does tons of in-class practice...overall  an excellent person.
5,One of the best teachers I have ever had in my life.For anyone who struggles with chemistry  take this teacher! He is extremely clear in his teaching  and goes above and beyond for his students. He lectures in a way where his students can understand  and encourages questions. I've never met a person so kind.
5,very helpful teacher   i will recommend this teacher to everyone who want to pass the class .
5,Great Professor! My chemistry was good in high school but this professor made it even easier to understand for me with great explanation and examples. he knows the chemistry really well u can almost ask any question and he knows the answer. Really great personality with a lot of knowledge !
5,Just like all the rest of these reviews  I concur he is the best teacher ever. He makes Chemistry fun!! If you ever get the chance to take his class  do it. You will appreciate chemistry for the rest of your life. I took his class over 15 years ago. Amazing professor.
4,Mary is overall a good teacher. You do not need the textbook just the lab manual. We almost never had lab or lecture quiz's even though we are supposed to. She gives out occasional extra credit. Ask questions if you have any because she is not the best at explaining things. For the practicals I would recommend using Quizlet to help you study.
5,Mary is straight forward. She only teaches the material necessary. Quizzes are from lab activities done in groups so attendance is important to get these points. As long as you do the work and study you will do well. She has a great sense of humor and I really liked her teaching style. I feel I learned what I needed to.
1,This professor has a tendency to get off topic incredibly easy. She is a very nice and funny person  but scatter brained is saying it nicely. Be prepared to teach yourself a lot on your own time  lecture heavy with little hands on learning.
5,Dr. Brown is a great professor. She does tend to get off topic often but she's funny and cares a lot about her students passing! I can't wait to take another class with her.
2,"Very disorganized. Will waste your time  for sure  with odd musings and unrelated tangents. Makes it very clear how little she knows. Often behind on material. Uses the lab time to make up lecture time. Doesn't give the ""big picture "" so you will have to teach yourself the material. On the upside  the exams are pretty easy if you use study guide"
4,Dr. Brown is a great professor. Anatomy is a very challenging course be she makes it enjoyable and understandable . This was my second time around taking Anatomy and with Dr. Brown as a professor I passed with a B! Make sure to keep up with notes provided. The greatest tool to passing this course is REVIEWING and using online lab tutorials.
5,She is funny  energetic  and really gets the students engaged in the class. The notes seem hard to keep up with at first but it's basically an outline of the lecture shes giving and it goes in order  you just have to follow along. She cares about her students and wants them to succeed so if you go to her with quesitons she is always willing to help
5,The best instructor I ever had  she makes learning easy because she makes sure you know the most important things. she focuses what you need know for real life and exam which makes grading easy. I got A in her class of Anatomy and you can also get that as long as you strive for it.
5,Mrs. Brown is awesome!! She is the best biology teacher I've ever had. She really wants you to succeed so she does all she can do to help you. She is also very nice and though the lectures are boring she makes it fun. This class is fairly difficult so make sure you don't miss days or you will be behind. Be on track with HW and study for your tests.
5,Great professor. Actually enjoyed this class. But no matter what teacher you have it is a stressful class. Lots of material to learn. I wouldn't recommend taking with 3 or 4 other classes. Too much.
4.5,The most amazing teacher you'll ever have!! Super funny and is always there to help. takes the time to meet with you and explain stuff. She is pretty straight forward on what she wants you to know.
4.5,She is very helpful during her office hours as well as class time  tries to set you up for success
4.5,Dr. Brown is great. She's extremely energetic  she can be hard to keep up with. But she really knows what she's doing. I would definitely recommend her. Anatomy is pretty horrible so having a good instructor makes a big difference.
5,Love her! She very helpful and very animated during class to keep attention. Had her in anatomy & now physiology. anatomy was a little harder  she gave 5pts extra credit on almost every exam! She gives really good study guides in physio and tells you almost exactly what you need to know. You'll regret not taking her! Wish she taught every bio class
4,She's a good teacher and she seems to know her stuff. She does get side tracked quite a bit but she seems very passionate about her work and the students in general. I only had her as a lab instructor but she's really awesome and she made it a point to teach everything she could in a timely manner. willing to help out at any point. Just ask her.
4.5,LOVE LOVE LOVE HER! She provides guided notes which make things a lot easier to follow and understand since there is so much material. Great sense of humor. VERY compassionate and understanding with her students.
4.5,I had Dr. Brown for BIO 2300 and she rocks!!! I took the class on a Sunday and she made it fun and enjoyable. She is always willing to answer questions and really challenges you. I found her to be very fair and supportive of everyone's overall goal of being successful.
4,It was a pleasure taking the summer 2012 class with Ms. Brown. She challenged us to learn and identified areas of curriculum that was of importance. It was good to know the teacher didn't give us everything and allowed us to learn outside the classroom and encouraged open lab along with the APR online learning tool. Thank you Ms. Brown! Enjoyed it
1,very confusing to teach. rushing and doesn't answer questions.
2,Mrs.Brown is a sweet person and is willing to help when you don't understand but her notes are horrible. You basically have to take your own notes and really study outsid eof the class if you want to pass. Her tests are pretty fair and she always includes extra credit.
3,His lectures were very clear and often simplified the material for us. His midterm exam was much easier compared to other sections. All in all he was a good teacher in class and kept the class entertaining with his slides. However on the downside he would sometimes seem annoyed or bothered to answer questions outside of class or at office hours.
5,Amazing teacher! I would definetly take him again. He's lectures are easy to follow and it's never boring.
5,FINA 405 with him is considered a CAPSTONE FINA course. You'll be solving cases and presenting throughout the semester. It's extremely useful for finance students looking to apply what they have learned. It's a very demanding course but you'll be ready for the workforce thereafter. He used to manage a multi billion hedge fund. The best prof w/ expe
5,Don't take class if you don't like group projects or presenting in front of class. The group project very difficult but you will learn a lot as well. His lectures are hilarious  but the group presentations are often tedious. Very respected teacher and will listen to you. His exams are very fair as well.
1,Worst teacher i had in JMSB  he doesn't teach you anything and doesn't care about his students  you don't know how he grades you  sent him 3 emails to review my exams he never replied  horrible teacher
1,6 case analysis and final is a case. Workload is heavy after midterm. All the cases are after the midterm. You'll find it hard to get anything above 75.
1,Never had a professor with such vague instructions and unclear grading criteria. Doesn't teach anything on financial modeling  you're supposed to learn it all by yourself. If your goal is to learn modelling and valuation  you're better off going to a seminar like Wall Street prep. I only got As in my 400level FINA classes and this class ruined it.
1,Taking this class was a negative experience. the grading seemed very random  with little feedback and no clear criteria. Instructions for the midterm were unclear. Help for the project was very vague  with most of the valuation skills learned online... no one failed the course  but there were very few As and no one knows why they got their grade
2,He's a great teacher and makes his lectures interesting but that's it. His way of grading is completely random and unjustified. He gave wrong instructions on what to focus on the midterm which resulted in a class average in the 50s. For the final we are supposed to value a stock without even having any complete financial statements.
1,Avoid him. He's fun to listen to and he knows his stuff but his grading is ridiculous. I completely agree with the reviews below: Make friends with him or forget your A. Switching section for him was the worst move of my final year at JMSB.
2,"""One of the worst at JMSB Finance. Avoid at all costs. Random grading criteria (basically gives you a good grade if he knows you). If you insist on taking a class with him  focus more on becoming his friend rather than spending too much time trying to get assignments/projects/exams right."" From another review  but my thoughts exactly. Wow."
2,One of the worst at JMSB Finance. Avoid at all costs. Random grading criteria (basically gives you a good grade if he knows you). If you insist on taking a class with him  focus more on becoming his friend rather than spending too much time trying to get assignments/projects/exams right.
5,He is very practical. His class always involve real world cases. And he is a easy marker. I will definitely take another class with him.
4.5,One of the best in Concordia! He explains everything clearly and he is always there to help! You will regret if you have never chosen him!
5,Good professor. His slides and explanation are very clear  but he doesn't post them  so you need to record them fast. Try your best to do the project! It's 40%!
4,Prof Wong is truly considerate for students' study progress and is willing help a student with good protaintials to achieve his/her goals. If you are a hard-worker  he is the one to choose to take.
5,One of the best professors in JMSB! He teaches student practical skills and finance in the real word  instead of boring textbook theory
5,One of the best professor in JMSB! He teaches student practical skills and finance in the real word  instead of boring textbook theory
1,This professor does not respect students regarding to his poor in-class sleepy behaviours and random marking criteria. He will literally forbid a student from taking his class in front of the whole class. There's rummer in school about him took over $100 gifts from students who are pursuing taking his class. It looks really bad if it is true.
2.5,He is a good teacher. Explain well. But HARD grader
4,Julie was great! class was easy and she kept it interesting. Text was a waste of money though because she explains everything!
5,Julia is absolutely wonderful person.She has the greatest big smile. She reminds me of the actress Gina Davis. She is so inspiring!
4,Nice  easy to approach
4.5,great teacher! she is very enthusiastic and passionate about anatomy which makes for a fun class  even though the material is fairly complex
4.5,great teacher also does not put up with class noise which is awesome!
4.5,Julie is an amazing professor. Students know that if they need help in any area of thier class/life  Julie is there to help. She makes learning fun and her nerdy jokes always keep the class laughing or at least a smile with an eye roll 
5,Ms Ablarde is the most kindhearted  hilarios and helpful teacher I have ever had. She has made school very interesting and makes me want to go. Her refrences to the Simpsons have made class more livly and fun. Ms Ablarde helps her students even on her own time if they are having troble understanding the matirial. I think she is awesome!!! :D
5,Julia is amazing - brilliant  a great teacher and beautiful! How DOES she do it all?
1,crazy crazy and crazy
5,Julia is BY FAR the best teacher I've ever had. She makes learning fun  you can't help but want to go to class. I hope she continues touching lives with her wit  intelligence  humour... I love you Julie!
5,Awesome teacher - makes sure that everyone understands everything. Ands a humorous element to every class!!!! Keep up the great work Julia!!!!
5,By using a mix of humour Julie turned a terribly dry and boring subject into a fun and informing class. She is the best professor I have ever had. Im just mad she doesnt teach 2nd year!
5,Julia is the hottest teacher I've ever had. That smile  those eyes and . . . .
5,Julia Rocks  she is so much fun top talk to! Love the Simpson quotes!
5,Awesome teacher! I luv her class!!!!
5,Prob the best prof I've ever had. I remember going into that class with no hope at all and little interest as it was my first 3000 lvl clss  when I saw the reserve reading package i nearly dropped the course bec of its size But truly one of the few teachers that actually teaches you sth that u will never forget & changes ur viewpoint on imp matters
4.5,easy to disagree with and argue ponits of disagreement
4.5,this man is a legend...
5,Awesome prof. Easy to get along with and easy to understand. Notes are hard to take in his class but if you listen and read you'll do fine. Easy marker and keeps you up to date on current issues.
3.5,I had no real complaints about MacKinnon. He was a really easy marker which was a definate plus and he was fairly easy to talk to. He'd be a great professor for someone just taking a Politics course to fill their schedule. Very straight forward.
3.5,Very up to date on current events. Very interesting thoughts and ideas  but I found that he spoke very fast! But taking his class did make me feel more informed and helped take the step towards voting
3,Yeah....up to date on current events....so he reads the newspaper. This guy uses discussion of current events as a crutch because he doesnt know the real material very well. Course was way too easy. A waste
1,No Comments
5,By far the best teacher ever. Wicked class a must take. You come out a changed person.
4,Very sharp and incisive  though a tad intimidating. Very provocative lectures.
5,Very up to date with current events. Very current content. Great sense of humour. Highly recommend  (you da' man now dawg!)
1,He's a smart guy but cant teach at all. He does meaningless confusing proofs the whole class. The two comments below are tripping. If you do get stuck with him just watch Professor Leonard on YouTube  he teaches the same material. I strictly watched his videos and took notes and finished the class with a solid A.
5,Very smart guy and lenient with grading. Didn't show up to class very often  although I kept up with the homework and stayed on top of my stuff. Even though it might be hard to understand him at times  I'd definitely recommend him.
5,Great professor! Very lenient grader.
4,I found Dr. Zhang very helpful in such a tough class. He takes a lot of care in explaining proofs and making sure that the material is well understood. The class moves quickly  so make sure you do the homework to keep up. He's always willing to answer homework questions. Won't fail you unless you don't try at all.
3,It is pointless to go to class  except for the weekly quizzes at the end of class. Just teach yourself from the textbook and work through problems. His tests are easy because the questions come from the textbook. The department final was also pretty easy  but I would say this class is easy for those who can self-teach.
2,Perfect teacher if you can teach yourself math  so just come for quizzes  & to ask what will be on the quizzes (which he will tell you). His accent & writing is rough  don't take if dependent on teacher explanation. Very generous with points on tests  attempts will get you far. 20% -weekly quizzes 20% -Midterms (2) 40% -Final
3.5,The only reason I took this professor is because he grades on a straight scale  90% is a 4.0  80% is a 3.0  etc. His lectures are a bit confusing as he unnecessarily explains things and ends up making it make less sense. I just used the book to teach myself most of the material and since he's an easy grader  got an A in the class.
1.5,Really tough class. He is very hard to understand  and his lectures are really confusing. For some reason his example problems come out unnecessarily long and confusing. tough time keeping up. Mostly studied on my own. Quizzes and tests are pretty hard  although i question his grading because his answer key didn't make sense. CAUTION WHEN TAKING!!!
3.5,Dr. Zhang does not have the greatest of English but the man is a master of math. For his lectures if you can get past the wordage and minor broken English then they are a great source of info. Gives partial credit galore  also gives credit for showing knowledge of material. Ran out of time showed I knew how to do it with indicators (fx) and got -1
2.5,He was hard  yeah  but this is college. Differential equations is not supposed to be a walk through the park! I went to every lecture and asked questions. I would spend hours every day at the library studying for just this class. BUT  again  this is college
2.5,The majority of the exam had content on it that was not covered very well. I hope you understand math and word problems if you take him.
2,i'm so patient with teachers and never thought id have to ever drop a class until i sat through one of this guys lectures. Couldnt understand anything and did all the practice problems for the quiz and it still made no sense. i usually never complain  but do NOT take this guy!
1.5,Very nice and knowledgeable man. Doesnt have the best or most useful lectures but if you ask him a question he will answer it. If you ask him a question on the quiz/exam he will definitely help you out. If you do the assigned homework problems(not collected)the quiz/exam will be a breeze. If you dont mind learning on your own go ahead and take him.
1,By far the worst teacher I have ever had. He is probably one of the most brilliant at Wayne State  but does not know how to teach by any means. He spends whole entire classes doing proofs and does not even teach on what we actually need to know for his impossible tests. I will say he is helpful during his office hours. I recommend him to no one.
1.5,"Sure he grades really easy but unless if you already taken a calculus class you will be lost every single lecture because he skips steps and doesn't explain what he's doing. If you can study a lot and learn on your own then take him because of his easy grading. People who say he's the ""best ever"" must already know calculus...."
4.5,This is the best math professor I have had. He is by far the easiest grader I have ever seen. With that being said make sure you practice and do problems. Put in the effort and you will get an A.
5,hes the best study his quizzes and midterms for the final and thats it  he bring the same problems
4,Very nice professor teaches the subject well. By far one of the best professors I've had thus far.
4,Good Professor  teaches the class very well  very helpful  makes calculus easy to understand even though it is a difficult subject
2.5,He seems to know his stuff. However  he wastes way too much time trying to prove EVERYTHING! This caused our section to fall behind. To catch up to the others for the final  he had to cover the last chapter with very little depth. He's a very easy grader  and overall  the class is extremely easy. Homework is optional.
3,Very nice lady. She rambles so you need to pay attention to the important stuff. Exams are not bad. She gives study guides. There are four exams no final and she gives extra credit at the end of the semester. If you read you will do fine in her class. She grades fairly and is willing to work with you
4,Extremely nice lady. Five exams and one paper. Good class but way too much material. She needs to lessen the amount but get more in depth. Lectures are interesting but don't really fit tests. Tests seem more like a memory exercise. She takes attendance so don't miss more than three classes. I got an A.
1,Shes the worst english teacher I have ever hsd!
2.5,Not very helpful to students at all. Questions in the study guide do not help and you spend so much time trying to memorize what you have read for the tests  that you don't have much time to learn other things.
1,Well prety much the content of the was was not important and was not part of a real english class. We had to read poems and then have a quiz on the poems and not english content it self. I wish I had droped this class the first day I steped foot into it.
4,I had her for 3010 and guess what guys? peace o cake! alot of these reviews seem baseless  6 essays 2 tests thats all! are you kidin me!? yea we had to read a book  but it wasnt that bad. Disregard (is that spelled wrong?) the other ratings  she is good
1,No Comments
4,She is the nicest person ever if you have to talk to her about anything but she does get lost in her lectures sometimes. I would take her again for another class because she wasn't bad. The tests were straight forward and the papers were very reasonable. She is real strict on attendance and takes it everyday twice a day.
5,She is the nicest person that anyone would ever meet in this world! The work is easy  all you have to do is read poems and write responses for them! You get a couple of major papers but all that matters is the grammar and not so much the content. But if you are completely off subject in everything you write  your grade might suffer.
1.5,This teacher is an attendance nazi! After 1 missed class  or 1 late arrival  or 1 early departure  you start losing 5-10 points off the final grade! She is horrible at lecturing and doesn't seem like she has much knowledge of the material  she skims the surface. Take someone else!
4,If you take notes  you're safe. Tests are very straight-forward-no trick questions.Rather dry and the time goes by slowly but it's worth it for an A.Quizzes are a joke  and the papers weren't bad either.
1,I quit school cause of her...its professors like her who give english literature a bad name....
1.5,"Gave too much homework and work in general. Overloaded with class work and unfathomed time window to finish a book. Grading critiques were not fair and to get anywhere  you have to suck up. Not my kind of ""learning experience""."
4.5,A course surveying 1000 years is not going to be easy but she knows her stuff. Take lecture notes  that's what tests are based on and read. Going to classes everyday is not unheard of  this class does require effort but you will be rewarded.
3.5,This teacher is very very hard. There are weekly quizzes in there. All of the essays are based from reading materials. No free topic. Very critical on grading essays. No Joke!
1,Horrible teacher  very tough on grading and assigns way too much work. Must show up everday and are overloaded with work. Also not avaible to discuss papers.
4.5,Makes you think but the essays were awesome to read. Very helpful
1,Awful  simply awful
2,Makes English harder than it has to be  gives in class assignments everyday  which are so dumb. Talks a lot and is very  very critical on your writing.
5,Great teacher. There may be a lot of reading...but she never asks tricky questions and the final exam is the exact same questions. You can even read cliff's notes and still get an A!
1,No Comments
2,this class is is supper hard  i would not reccommend it unless it is required.
1,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!! this was the worst class i have ever taken. i showed up to class everyday and taped everything he said i also did all the reading and i still failed. i was a 4.0 student before i took this class. 200 out of 300 students failed the
1,Horrible teacher  his tests were unneccessarily hard and his classes were so boring that you never want to go. he really should stop teaching
3,Besides the fact that he mumbles constantly and gives hard tests  the class wasn't too bad. The lab boosts your grade and he grades tests on a curve. Lectures were somewhat interesting but a lot of people failed... then again there was quite a few stupid questions asked by the students during lectures  so you can't blame it all on him.
4,The class is very easy if you actually go to all of the lectures and pay attention. His tests were not hard at all. Plus he was very easy going and listened to any concerns you had.
1,the advisors are investigating him -- nice guy  but ridiculously hard class.never missed a lecture or lab completed all of the reading and still failed. I had close to a 4.0 before I took his class. the tests were impossible and definitely not anything that was covered in the book or lecture.
1,Is the worst professor ever at wsu he should be fire!
1,I dont like the way he teaches. and he is the most borning professor I have ever had!
5,He is difficult  and tends to have high expectations for students but is not unfair. He curves his exams  and listens to student input. He also is a very dynamic lecturer with just an amazing amount of knowledge. If you want to learn about Psychology  take a class from him.
1,"One of Pych prof's told me that Wayne suspended him once for failing more than half the class. He's HARDER than hell. This is a PhD psych level class- not a beginning psych level class!!! He's beyond difficult and gives very FEW A's and B's. Don't take him unless you want a ""D"" or ""F!"""
1.5,I can't believe this guy taught Intro! If you don't get a 'C' average on all 4 tests  you automatically get an 'E' regardless of your lab grade! I went to every lecture (except 2) and come exam time everything was foreign! Not recommended. Lab was great  but lecture destroyed many! Had to retake!
5,If you can appreciate genius in action  take a class with this professor. He is tough  but with good reason. Pay attention and you might learn something. Besides  that smile of his makes it easy to forgive him for being a hard grader!
3.5,He is a very hard teacher. The lab is easy but the exams are very hard. Just about immposible to get a good grade in lecture. At the begining of class even says that more then half of the class will get a C or lower and eventually drop.
4,He's an excellent teacher. You learn alot but have to earn everything. Recomend him if you truly want to learn about psychology.
1,Not at all helpful or clear about what he wants out of students. Worst professor I have had at this school.
3,tests unreasonably difficult--practically impossible to get an A. Never missed class  but almost never knew what he was talking about either. (Get out while there's still time!!!)In spite of this  he's sublimely charming and keeps your attention riveted.
5,Brilliant and Sexy
4,tests are extremely hard. he trys to make lectures interesting  and he somewhat succeeds. definitely would not reccommend him because its hard to get a decent grade unless u want to study your life away.
4,"Nice person  but very odd. Knows what he is talkin' about but he is probably the only one. I am not too sure if Dr. Lakey's thoughts ""generalize"" to others' thoughts."
5,I've learned the most from Jon out of any teacher at Bethel.
5,Jon is one of the best people I have ever met. His passion for theatre and his extreme knowledge and skill in theatre is very evident. Any class you take with him has a profound impact on you. But it's the times just working with him that you learn most.
5,No Comments
5,Excellent teacher. Very good at explaining concepts clearly and gives coursework that is relevant and helps improve your skills. I feel I improved my Spanish a great deal in this class.
4,Hard class but she's pretty helpful if you ask for help. Class could be boring at times  interesting at others. Very nice prof! and has led a pretty interesting life!
5,Is very qualified  but sometimes lets classes drag.
5,great lady  but class is hard
2.5,Proessor Koene has lost all touch with what it is like to be a college student. The class contains a ridiculously obscene amount of work for a few measly credits. This class has made me hate the Spanish language  no exaggeration
5,Dr. Koene is awesome. Her class is very interesting and there are many opportunities to work on conversation skills. She is kind and fair and has a lot of experience
5,Koene is great! She's hard enough to make you think and work  but she doesn't give you busywork that doesn't make sense to do. She also likes to help students and is very patient. Plus  she's had such an interesting life!
4.5,He is the best professor in entire UHCL .I have seen most of the professors in UHCL but none like him   character wise and as a teacher. Very soft person   dosent get angry at all. He knows the subject very well and has great knowledge in it . Most on them take advantage of his lineance and dont listen to class .Hes a great personality.
3,Late to the start of class 60 - 70% of time. Often runs class late as much as 20 minutes. 95% of class time is reading powerpoint slides. Very little insight compared to reading the textbook. Assignments are poorly structured.
2.5,The most unorganized teacher I have ever had. His tests are ridiculously long. Reads from slide to slide  just like all teachers at UHCL. My recommendations to someone who wants to learn .NET  read a book it?s basically the same thing but without a massive test. DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE IF YOU WANT AN A!!!!!!!
4.5,Great professor. Very helpful and cares a great deal about his students. Very knowledgable professor probably the smartest man I know. He is kind of soft spoken but he knows what he is talking about and is willing to help
3.5,Sometimes  class duration was too long and unnecessary. Allowed late submissions for assignments. Slow or no response to email. Otherwise  he was patient and straightforward. Assignments were vague and students would submit their own interpretation instead of using a template for consistency.
2.5,HE is one of the most BORING instructors I've ever had. He just reads the slides and you have to sit for 3 hours and listen. You have to study on your own   he doesn't help much.
2,"Tests are short essay  tough programming and simply long. Programs are very challenging and often take full time to complete. He's still learning a lot about .NET etc but fairly decent in covering the topic. He will look things up if he doesn't know. Class sessions are ""Mmmm Kay"" sleepy."
4,He has a take it easy  California style teaching ways. His programs are hard but do-able. You might have hard time hearing him in the class. Suggestion: Sit in the front seat. For exams  practise the exercises at the end of each chapter. His assignments are done in grp of 2 - choose a good partner.
3,No Comments
1.5,do not know how to teach
1.5,He gives very tough homework assignment on programming. Programming in Internet Protocol class!!! yes.. his teaching is bad.. he just go over the text book builted powerpoint and read what the slide say.. i do not recommend taking his class. so beware!!!!
1,Wouldnt take this class ever again
5,I hated the class  but Professor Fox was really helpful. He was incredibly nice and super patient. He was a joy  but I'm glad the class is over!
5,Professor Fox is an outstanding teacher. He really cares and makes a somewhat difficult subject easy and a lot of fun. I looked forward to going to class every day. I went out of my way to take another class with him next semester.
5,Prof. Fox is an amazing teacher. Even if students are not interested  Prof. Fox motivates them. He is fun in class and lvoes joking around with students. Very reasonable and clear expectations for class and tests. He is an absolutely wonderful teacher.
5,Prof. Fox is by far the best Spanish teacher I have ever had. He works hard to make us talk in class and engage us in the lesson. He is update to date with technology and uses it well. He really wants us to learn and remember forever rather than just learn to pass the test. A very good teacher.
4.5,one of the nicest persons i've ever had the privilege of meeting! readings for class were somewhat hard but we went slow and he helped a lot. too much translating though. very helpful prof and very understanding! not a lot of homework - just reading and one major paper and presentation. some parts of tests were a bit hard though.
4.5,Amazing guy. Class is fairly easy and he is extremely nice and knowledgeable. Take him at every chance you have!
5,Fox was very funny and definitel one of the best teachers I have ever had.
5,My only complaint- I wish he'd speak more in Spanish only during class.
1,I wish he was as accurate with figuring grades as he is with language. thanks.
5,Prof. Fox is interesting  challenging  helpful  understanding  and intelligent. I wish I could have taken more courses from him.
4.5,Professor Fox is very kind and very intelligent. He is interested in his students and his class is stimulating.
5,No Comments
5,Fox is my advisor  so I get to know him more than a lot of other students. He is supernice and helpful - a little scatterbrained with meetings  but that is easily forgiveable. I suggest him because he makes the class so easy because it's fun.
5,Very helpful and engaged the students. Explains topics clearly and is easy to understand.
1,I hate this woman. She's too arrogant for her own good. And yes  Id liketo see her academic career go down one day. I just think she's dry and boring and makes a class that involves SOIL a blah course.
5,Shes the sexiest teacher that i have ever seen...good teacher and fair marker
4,she good at keeping your attention. also helpful
5,Awesome professor  gives you time   always there for you  helps you pursue your interest  respects hard work
5,Great to deal with. Makes the class enjoyable  though you do have to earn your grade. But it's not like the hardest there.
3.5,great professor
5,she is the excellent instructor if you really want to learn.All of classes she's teaching are foreland of computer science and engineering .Can't image she can hand all these very tough classes so clearly.that's enough to prove she can catch the step of development of computer science and engineering.Strongly recommend her class.
1.5,"Doesn't seem to put the time into this class. Should stop bringing her kids to school. Can you say ""babysitter""?"
1,Shes not good at subject
4.5,Her class is very good. Her teaching is good. She just go over the students understanding and convenience. I would recommend her class. :)
2.5,Made people almost cry in class because of how he went about criticizing people's papers. He just wanted students to write papers he thought was correct  rather than write from their own opinions. He needs to learn how to criticize constructively  instead of blasting people for trying their best. Good intentions  but really bad.
5,The epitome of pedagogy. If you believe your teacher should not impart their own views in class  and their purpose is to get you to think for yourself  then this sociologist is for you.
5,such a great guy and a great professor. i've learned so much and he's so interesting and fun.
4,I LOVE him. He is SO interesting and funny. Very laid back  so if that's not what you need from a professor  don't take him.
4,His accent is pretty nice. Good teacher  easy class
4,As baller as they come. Laid back but always willing to help out the lost and confused. Teaches a v. lucid Methods class that moves along at a crisp pace  infusing practical-type material with nicely coherent conceptual binding. Also has a dope accent you will not be able to imitate  trust me. Class subheading: How To Save The World Using Surveys.
5,professor gay is my favorite professor so far at conn.
1,Dullard  dullsville  dull.
4,R. Gay was the man  what up big dog
5,Great professor. Very interesting and smart. Had a great time in his class. Never boring.
4,He made a methods class fun. That takes skill. But what is up with the loony comments he leaves on graded papers?
4.5,Very cool and insightful. A good first semester freshman class.
4.5,A great guy. Loves what he does  the lectures are interesting  and he adds humor to keep us from falling asleep. His accent adds to the class  and those who say they can't understand him are sheltered and need a hearing aid. His exams and papers are fair and helpful.
2,very boring lectures  doesn't try to make them interesting
5,one of the best professors in the school
2.5,alright guy... pretty boring class
5,Funny Guy. He loves his job. He cares
5,makes a point to get to know students!
2.5,No Comments
5,He's such a passionate professor and I loved taking his class. It's clear that he loves his area of expertise and enjoys teaching people about the Holocaust. The books and readings assigned are very interesting and most often a pretty easy read. I LOVED THIS PROFESSOR
5,Love him. Also taking his Nazi Germany class and he's awesome as ever.
5,This professor is amazingly passionate about the courses he teaches. Thoroughly knowledgeable and cares about what the students think during lecture. Definitely take a course with him if you can!
4.5,Absolutely my favourite professor  hands down. Funny  passionate  very caring about his students and the subject.
4,This professor is wonderful. I had him for two of my courses. His lectures are delivered as if in theatre so you cannot possibly fall asleep in class :)
5,Great lectures  he knows his stuff and is really passionate about the topics. The textbook was short and well written. A funny and engaging speaker  I will definitely take a course with him again.
5,This prof is honestly one of the best I've ever had.
4.5,He was a great prof. Made the class very interesting and easy to follow. Able to really keep your attention  I really enjoyed the class.
5,One of the most well-taught classes I've taken. It isn't a 'bird course' but his lectures are so interesting you are guaranteed a good mark if you show up and pay attention.
5,Pretty much the greatest teacher I've had so far at Waterloo. He's hilarious and makes you wanted to attend class. Definitely take as many courses with him as you can  you won't regret it!
4.5,Favourite prof so far. Makes the class amazing - I am a health student but he actually made me think of taking more history classes.
5,He was probably my favourite prof at waterloo!
5,Amazing!!! He is a profound teacher who makes you think  is very funny  and gives you goosbumps when you hear his stories. His passion shows through his lectures. He is the reason I want to persue a career in the study of Holocaust history.
5,Dr. Bruce is the GREATEST prof I have ever had. It is because of him that I am still pursuing history. He is ALWAYS available outside of class and he makes the students WANT to go to lecture. I never missed a class  just because he's so interesting and entertaining.
5,Fabulous professor! He will do anything to ensure you understand whats going on. He has an amazing sense of humor  yet is passionate about what he does. I suggest taking as many courses with him as you can.
5,Prof Bruce was the best professor ive ever had. His avid interest in what he teaches is translated into how he teaches. His interest is contagious  after every class I wanted to go out and read more on what he taught. This man is a genious  funny and cares about his students. I looked forward to this class every day and hated when it ended.
5,Excellent history prof  I highly recommend his courses.
4,Wow  what's there to say about Gary that hasn't been said.. He really is all that and more. Best professor I've had in 3 years  not to mention one of the only classes that I looked forward to attending and wished it wasn't over when the lecture ended. SO GREAT!
4,Awesome prof!! His class is interesting b/c he is genuinely interested in what he's teaching. He makes the subject matter easier to take in given the nature of the class. Overall one of my fav profs everrr!!!
5,Gary is an amazing prof! i have never looked forward to going to any class as much as i do for Gary's! He doesn't rush through info  and repeats info that's crucial. Plus  he makes time for his students and is always willing to help. He is a tough marker but a great guy all around and soo funny! You must take this class it's amazing!
3.5,Professor Praitis is helpful. BUT  she really takes off a lot of marks on attendance. She CURVES  not in a good way. If she wants only three A in class  she gives your final paper and poster Bs without telling you ANY REASON so that your overall grade can fall from A to A- or B+. On her class  BE CAREFUL on your every homework and quizzes.
5,I've loved Professor Praitis's class. She manages to explain a lot of pretty difficult concepts in easy-to-understand terms. Lab independent projects are a lot of fun  and she's always more than willing to help you with anything lab- or class-related. Quizzes require you to show your knowledge rather than vomit up a bunch of stuff you've memorized.
5,Best professor ever happen to me :D She is nice  and give respectful feedback on every piece of homework you submit. She taught wonderful genetics  and she knows what she is talking about during class. She is also super helpful on projects. I'd definitely recommend her to anyone.
3.5,She's an okay prof. She's somehow simultaneously very reasonable and hopelessly out of touch with students. She'll push back a deadline  but then not be clear what she wants from the assignment. She'll help if you ask for it  but is also harder than other 150 profs in that she assigns more work.
5,she is very engaging and caring professor. She has profound knowledge about C.elegans and embryo development. I would recommend taking her bio intro class.
5,Really awesome teacher. Excellent class  nice model system  basically  everything you'd ever want in a bio class--in one bio class. Now She's my advisor  so the bias is just what it says on the label.
5,This class was an amazing experience for me. My bio background was beyond the intro level: however  the deep paper discussions were informative and her perspective as a geneticist refreshing. Her grading can be demanding  but always fair. She engages students with the material  and I even got to work on a project directly related to her research.
5,Wow  I learned more than I thought I would. Paper discussions were the best I have ever had at Grinnell  labs  however  sucked--a lot. This was not Vida's fault though: yeast have a habit of not always working. In regards to Vida teaching 251  it is important to realize that ALL of the bio professors teach right out of the book
4.5,Vida was an amazing professor to have for a tutorial. Although she was quite demanding  she was very helpful and interesting  and usually very clear in her asignments and grading.
1.5,her lectures are based off the book's supplied powerpoints verbatim. classes are very very boring. Tests often lose sight of the fundamentals. She is very enthusiastic outside of class  and her labs are fun. i don't really recommend her as a prof.
4.5,I had Vida for one class her first year of teaching  and I can't remember what it was  but I remember that  although the class was hard  I really liked her and thought she was very accomodating to student's needs.
3.5,I dunno what this first guy is saying. She was the first proff to actually make me love bio. If you are interested in genetics then don't hesitate. If you get her style then it's a piece of cake. Participate even if you don't know.
3,She's a very kind  caring professor  but her Intro Bio class was pretty boring  overly focused  and didn't teach anything new.
3.5,Vida is so nice that it's hard not to like her. However  her lectures can be unclear  and her assignments are not spaced very well throughout the semester. But she's very approachable and always willing to help.
4.5,What a nice person! She is very approachable and her lecture material is clear. I would definately recommend any class with her.
5,very good teacher. the best i had. willing to go the extra mile. subjects were well thought out and organized. it seemed like she enjoyed what she did and cared about women's studies and the empowerment of many types of women.
5,probably the best prof I had all year :D
4.5,Super nice lady  willing to help you out. The course itself is alright. Some of it (the thoery part early on  particularly) is quite boring but I thought she did a pretty good job of mixing things up in terms of assigned readings and videos.
5,Excellent
5,Dr. Spivey really cares about his students. He has talked to me many times in his office about personal life stuff and class stuff. He is very smart in his field of study. His examples he uses in class fit perfectly with the material we cover.
4.5,That man knows how to do two things teach psychology and wear a beard. Great professor!
4.5,He's interesting and knowledgable. Was an amazing teacher for social psych  but is quite lazy in his methods for personality theory. Prefers to make us sit in small groups most the time and teach ourselves. I dont pay for classmates opinions or to teach myself the book...he should be held accountable for this...i want my money back!!
5,THE MAN. He knows more about Psychology  then I know about my face. Way to go Norm.
4.5,He can be kinda tough  but he really knows his stuff. I'm so glad I had him as a professor. He is definitely one of the best psyc. profs out there.
4.5,Dr. Spivey is a very good teacher  not always the easiest teacher  but knows what he is talking about
5,hot and awesome!
2,"Unpleasant. She took her bad days out on us. Maybe its a bad relationship or she is just an unhappy person. Check with the department for what ""staff"" means just in case you get stuck with her."
5,No Comments
4.5,Very helpful and available to answer questions. Seems like she cares a lot about us and likes what she teaches.
4,Professor Dobson is very knowledgable in this subject and makes the class lectures interesting. There is a reflection question after every class  but they're easy and good for review anyway. There's a few other 15 point assignments that will help to boost your grade because the exams are tough. Let's you out of class early often.
5,He is SO funny and so kind. His class is so much fun even if science doesn't interest you. His lectures are never boring and as long as you come to class and pay attention the exams are really easy. Great guy!
5,One of the most knowledgeable and helpful professors I have had at Grand Valley! I would recommend taking any class that he teaches!
5,One of my favorite professors so far! Dobson does a great job engaging students and seems to get everyone excited to learn. Science has never been my favorite subject  but this has so far been my favorite class I have ever taken. Even for an 8am class  I never wanted to skip because there was so much material covered and class was very interesting.
5,Great professor. Bio isn't really my thing but his sense of humor and stories he would tell (related to class topics) made class more interesting. Really cares about students and definitely wants to make sure we all succeed. Couldn't have picked a better professor.
5,I wish Prof. Dobson taught 226 because he would be my first choice. He is an amazing professor who knows what he is talking about. All of class is lecture but it is engaging and easy to follow along. Sometimes he talks super fast  but if you ask him to repeat something  he will do it right away and make sure you understand. I highly recommend him!
4,Dobson is super nice and he wants everyone to succeed. If you don't go to class  don't worry. Puts lectures on blackboard and easy to follow. Always got out of class early and he stays after class if you have questions.
4,This teacher is great just a tough class
5,I was scared of this class beforehand because I'm not really a science person. However  I truly enjoyed this class (even at 8am) because Prof. Dobson makes the content interesting and cares if you do well. He lectures most of class but if you print off the power points  it is relatively easy to follow along. I would take him again if I could!
5,One of the greatest professors I've had the pleasure of getting to learn from. Very tough material but thats biology for yah  he did an incredible job at explaining methods.
5,By far the best teacher I have ever had.
3,Wants all students to do well but makes it damn near impossible. Does not give any extra credit and does not curve any exams which is annoying when all other professors curve their grades. Hard tests but if you read his powerpoints verbatim then you should be fine. Study for the quizzes because those are easy points and do well in lab!
4,Alot of people have given Dobson a bad name  but I honestly think that he does a really great job at actually teaching the course. Its a lot of material and he expects you to know it  so its on you to study your ass off  BUT he explains everything so its easier to understand  and is more than willing to answer any questions. Lectures are essential.
4.5,Dobson is a great professor. He is funny  engaging  and honestly teaches a lot to his students in the amount of time he has. That being said  he is incredibly difficult compared to the other professors that teach this class. If you are looking for a good professor who will teach you material  look no further. If you want an easy A  keep searching.
4.5,Professor Dobson is a great professor. If you are looking to not learn and what an easy pass  he is not the guy to take. You will definitely need to read and study a lot outside of class. He give outline and base his test off of those. He Is very helpful and wants his students to pass. I would recommend taking him if you want to truly learn biology
5,Dobson is a great professor and you can really tell he wants you to do great in his class and genuinely cares about his job. He is very helpful during lecture but you definitely need to read and study a lot outside of class to pass the tests!
4.5,He is super helpful. Since its BIO  you know its going to be hard  but he makes sure you know what he expects of you. He tells you exactly what to study and how to get an A.
4.5,Professor Dobson was a very nice teacher who made lectures interesting. He was always cracking a joke during lecture. The tests are very hard  and if you don't study a lot  you won't pass. If you're looking to put the time in  I would definitely recommend him.
4.5,Tells you exactly what you need to know and all information is in his power point lectures  even if you don't understand the book helps a lot! It can be tough but as long as you pay attention and study you will do well!
4,Makes you work for your grade but tells you exactly how to get the grade you want. Study the powerpoints back and forth until you know them like the back of your hand and you will be good for the exams.
5,Prof. Vyse has done a great job sparking my interest in Psychology. He does a great job keeping the class engaged with his helpful powerpoint slides  succinct explanations of main ideas  and integration of out-of-textbook materials. He will make you work hard  but you will learn a lot. In addition  he is very kind and has a good sense of humor.
2.5,At times he can a bit too silly and forget that he's actually trying to prepare you for his tests.
4.5,He was a funny  excellent professor. He made the material interesting.
5,GREAT professor. Probably one of my favorite professors at Conn. He presents his material in a clear and concise manner  while also trying to add a little humor to it. Had him for two classes and can't wait to take more with him
4,I LOVE PROFESSOR VYSE!!! He is adorable and funny and makes class interesting. I definitely recommend him for any psych class. I had his for 101 and 201 and he is just an amazing teacher.
4,really liked his class
2,"Instead of ""V"" for Vyse  I accidentally clicked on ""B"" for boring. No lie. I suggest learning to sleep with your eyes open. He's nice but scatterbrained and his classes (I took 101 and 201) aren't particularly hard."
4.5,HE IS AMAZING!!!! One of the best classes ever!
4,Good professor. I had him for both Psych 101 and Psych Stats 201. He uses slides for everything so if you miss class you can just print out the slides and learn from that. Also if you print out the slides before class (like the night before)  then you get to write down the other things he says more easily and that helps a lot. Highly recommend!
4.5,amazing. really clear. funny!
5,Very helpful  very informative  very funny (even in advanced stats!)  and very cute!
5,Professor Vyse is AWESOME. HE makes the material interesting at the 100 level course and incorporates a great sense of humor. He seems very reasonable in his grading  but mostly just a really intelligent  funny professor
5,he is a GREAT teacher. irrational behavior is interesting to begin with but he makes it even more enjoyable. he tells jokes all the time. very easy to talk to. gives you more time when needed on assignments. i think he grades very fairly. you do the work you get the grade you deserve.
5,HILARIOUS. makes each class hysterical. also a really nice guy.
4.5,For the class size he does a really good job. Interesting material. He plays music before each class and has a sense of humor  which makes the lectures even better.
5,i love the class
5,I love prof. Vyse  he is my academic advisor . He's really funny and that always helps in a science class....idk what to say about him  take his class and find out
5,I loved this course! He makes the material so interesting and is really nice.
4,Funny guy  interesting so far.
5,He may have high expectations for the boring intro classes compared to some other teachers  but hes actually a really interesting  funny  great guy if you get to know him in upper level clases.
5,Good in teaching.. Approachable.. Tough course..
5,Probably one of tbe best teachers at McGill BUT his tests are very hard. Be prepared to put a lot of time in this course. Make sure you understand the material well (do as many previous midterms and finals as you can). This class is for sure the hardest one I've taken at McGill.
4,He's an excellent prof  teaches really well  explains everything clearly and is very helpful if you go during his office hours. However  his exams are very tricky so you might want to get your concepts clear. Solve his past exams  make sure you really understand the solutions and you should be good.
5,He is very nice prof. Clear  precise and explains very well. Answer your questions seriously. Exams are bit hard but within the material he covers. He is very responsible and respect students well. Best prof. at McGill.
5,-
5,His knowledge and wisdom fascinates me. He was always smiling when talking to people. I've no engineering background  but he approved my taking his course  and so patiently explained every basic things about engineering to me. I wish I could take one more of his course. But I'm no longer at McGill. I miss him  and his marcov chains.
5,One of the best electrical teacher you can find!
5,I took him for signals 1 (303)   I must say he is the best prof....explains the stuff really well. this final was hard but the marking was lieneant.....take him for any course.....i love his greek accent
5,Easily one of the best teachers i've ever had. Very clear  helpful  and knows his stuff. Nice guy.
5,Prof. Psaromiligkos is perhaps the most clear and precise professor that I have ever taken a class with. He is also extremely dedicated  hardworking and is always willing to clarify any doubts that a student may have. His class notes are very well organized. He is also very friendly and has a nice sense of humor. Indeed  the best prof at McGill.
5,he is a great prof. Down to earth  when ure with him u never feel like u
4.5,A good prof who understands why students don't understand.
2,Bush is the type of guy who only wants to hear what he wants to hear. He doesn't like when people correct him and he assigns many assignments (multiple due on the same day & sometimes forgets they were even due). Also  his favorite thing is calling on every single person in the class and putting them on the spot with questions.
2,This was probably the worst experience I have ever had. If you are a female  forget it. If you correct him when he is wrong  forget it. He thinks he can grade you at the end of the semester by just what he thinks. My A was brought down to an A- because of it.
5,Incredibly hard at first but becomes the most useful class anyone in the field could take. The way he prepares his students for Post Grad life is ten times better than most of his colleagues in the Fitzwater Center. Not a bad thing to say about him and do not take anything personally.
5,Best teacher ever! I have had him all four years and he has taught me a lot  I have a great deal of respect for this man! And I hope people will have the same experience I have had :)
3.5,He is a really good journalism professor! He will pick on you  but usually its because you didn't do your work. Overall  be prepared to do a lot of work  but you will actually learn something 
4.5,pretty good prof
5,Awesome professor...pushes you to strive for the best...those who don't like him much have never really taken the time to get to know him  or they are probably failing his class because they don't do their work or read. I've had him for all four years and he's my advisor. I have nothing but good things to say about him.
4,The man rules  the beard says it all. The only Bush haters are the ones who belong in community college and can't handle an actual class where you have to be prepared and know your****.
1.5,Horribly boring professor - he spends the whole class trying to find someone who isnt paying attention or doesnt know an answer so he can humiliate them. Also  he is very discourteous and continues to lecture 5 minutes after the class should have ended. The only way to get the guy to stop talking is to physically start packing up your books.
5,Professor Bush is the man  he makes class so much interesting by putting pressure on people to speak up.
1,Worst teacher i have had in my life.
5,Senior Seminar is over the top as far as assignments go - it's total chaos. Overall  though  he's a good professor and he's very reasonable when it comes to grading. If you've met the requirements and you've demonstrated that you've done the work  you'll do fine. He's also a good advisor if you're a journalism student.
4,Good class...a bit boring if you've had Journalism in high school..Prof Bush is decenta fair grader (in J1 at least)...I wish he wasn't the only Journalism Prof though...he can be funny and sarcastic at times...he stressed professionalism to the max  so no computer games during class and you'll be fine!!!
5,Bush is cool...but can get kinda boring at times. Overall - good guy
3,def. knows what he's talking about. only complaint is that he repeats himself a lot.
1,even he doesnt know what he's talking about...
4.5,"How can you not love a prof who will call shoddy work ""Barfy"" or  my personal favorite  ""Barfarific""? He knows his stuff and if you follow his advice you'll learn a lot."
4,"Funny guy  he sort of says that whole ""ehhhh not quite thing alot"" but if you pay attention you will learn a lot from him. He is a fair grader too"
5,No Comments
4.5,good guy  knows his stuff
2,Very unorganized  late to class every day. I learned more from the TA in my lab. Notes are hard to decipher and contain mistakes. Lectures are a waste of time.
1,This class is easy  but professor is horrible at explaining and a lazy  unfair grader. He is even worse when you try to contact him for any issue whether it be class related or advising related. His jokes are not funny at all. Grab the handout and leave the class  fortunately for you  the handout does a better job of explaining than he does.
1.5,His knowledge of the subject is extensive  Dr. Ndon has never tried to implement dialogue in the class setting. In addition last semester he was between 15-20 minutes late to every lecture without exception  which in a 50 min class  leaves no time other than straight lecture. Furthermore  his TA for labs English language skills was not sufficient.
4,Dr Ndon is an excellent teacher. His concern and natural interest for this subject is displayed by his teaching methods. I took this class the first time they offered it and I would recommend it to anyone else that is interested engineering for the environment. His tests and grading is extrememely fair. I would definetly recommend it.
1,Hes the most unorganized and laziest teacher inthe civil engineering department. To put it short and sweet he's an idiot
4.5,His a good teacher  but doesn't like to give lot's of A's so donxe2x80x99t expect an A even if you get A's on all you midterms and hw and lab  because the final is very hard and because of that most of the grades drop.
4,Notes and lectures are very clear. The homework is long but clear and understandable. There are no surprises on the exams.
5,Dr Ndon is very clear in his lectures. He makes the material seem easy and the exams are relevant to what is taught in lecture. I would definitely recommend him to anyone that might need to take this class.
4.5,Dr Ndon is a very good man who is concerned for his students at most times. He is very open-minded towards the students and their requirements. He is also a very open-minded person in terms of testing. Being that he is very smart  he sometimes gives exams that are hard but he makes up for it later.
5,Great course for understanding the complex process of hazardous waste managment and treatment process. The handouts were very clear and Dr. Ndon was always available for help outside the class.
5,The lectures in this class were very clear and understandable. There were plenty of examples given in class. The class was conducted in such a way that one did not even need to consult the book that much. Dr. Ndon was very nice and helpful!
5,After having just taken the EIT exam  I can say that CE 170 was very helpful. The class was conducted very well--the lectures were clear and understandable. Dr. Ndon was always accessible and willing to help. Overall  I enjoyed the class very much.
1,He is well-prepared. His notes are very clear and understandable. The fact that he is well-natured helps also. I highly recommend him.
4.5,He is a well prepared professor  and gives us the experimences that are related to the course. His homework assignment can help us to undterstand the class materials. Dr. Ndon is available in all his office hour.
5,His lecture is understandable.
1.5,Although he presents himslef as generally good natured  Dr. Ndon is an ineffective teacher. He is lazy and doesn't advance his student's understanding.
1,HE SUCKS....you learn nothing about engineering...
1.5,he reads out of the book.thts the lecture.dont even bother going to class.go ask him sumthing about the projects he'll tell u to check with lab instructor and the lab instructor just sends u back to him DO NOT TAKE HIM WITH SIAMBIS.YouWill ScrewUrselfOver
4,Dr. Krieglstein is one of the most shameless self-promoters ever encountered. All required texts were authored by him  only one about ethics (<80 pgs). Did film analysis based on the 3 or 4 ethical theories actually covered. Final entailed giving our opinion of his novel (did we like it and why?). Got 100% and feel that I learned nothing.
5,This guy is too deep for any sort of character based review. He dosen't care about your submissions just submit the work on time and you'll get an A. He's seriously like a hype man for his own material. All of the course material is authored by him  and he even comes equipped with his own Wikipedia page. You won't learn much other than his resume.
3.5,EASY teacher. The movies you have to watch arn't that bad and papers are super easy to get A's on. Easy grader  as long as you seem like you kinda understand. Impossible to fail this class.
4,Took the online class  VERY time consuming. Not to mention you must buy 3 of his textbooks which COD doesn't even carry. I got an A because I sucked up in the papers I wrote (you have to write an 800 word essay a week) His book Compassion is very difficult to understand. Really struggled through the whole thing. Wouldn't reccomend him for online.
4,The online course was very time consuming. Watch movies  read his book and write a paper each week. The material is interesting. I feel like I did learn quite a bit  but would have learned more in a classroom setting. Syllabus is clear  you know what is expected from the start.
5,I really enjoyed introduction to philosophy with Werner. He is very intelligent and has a lot of wisdom to share. I would recommend taking his class to everyone.
2,He mostly taught of whats wrong with Plato and Aristotelean views and why his philosophies are right.Very ignorant to Abrahamic religions made me believe that he has never really read a Bible or Quran because he was off in his facts.But if you want to know his views hes great.I had him his last semester so he must have already checked out upstairs
5,I liked this class a lot. I thought that using movies to write papers on the subject matter was an interesting idea. He used some audio CDs in this class that were really good. Made us think about things we otherwise would not have.
2,boring  easy A
4,I took this class through the internet. 6 papers  1 midterm  and a final. You watch movies and then write your papers based off them and what you read in your books. It is a no brainer  he gave me an A  and I never even finished reading his book  Compassion. If you need an easy credit  take this class ( it was a lot of work  but he's a fair grader)
3,If you want an easy A  take his class! You do very little work.. He curves his tests like 100% so it's impossible for u to fail.. You just have to show up to class. He's kind of strange but i got used to him.
5,Currently taking the class online  Great professor...His book Compassion is very insightful. Easy grader in the sense that he values ur opinion and is very open to new arguements. Leaves constructive feedback on all papers. Reading the Book (Not difficult) Watch movies  do the papers and u'll do great :)
4,loved him in this class. he made the philosophy class what its supposed to be. wish i could have him as a teacher again. sadly i already have ethics done. he uses his own books that he wrote for text books so if you have any questions about the reading he knows exactly wht it means
3,He was very friendly and nice. Sometimes he was hard to understand. I had trouble during his class and missed a lot of class  I got Cs on most my tests but since I got an A on the final and participated I got an A in the class! Hes very easy going!
3.5,(Ethics) He is a cool dude because he doesn't have a set agenda to class. He doesn't assign h/w but has a couple tests which are rather easy if you fill out your work book. The material covered in class is important  but what he grades more on is your opinions and your values/views. Pretty cool dude if you ask me....
5,Ethics is a good class to take if you need an easy humanities credit. I thought my papers sucked but I guess in ethics your opinion could be right so he gives you the A. My midterm I thought I bombed but because I rebuttled some of the questions I got the A too. What a good teacher!
4.5,Dr. Krieglstein is a great Prof. He grades based on your true desire to learn and the effort you put into understanding the material. He assigns a paper based on topics found in one of his books and assigns journal entries based on reading material and movies in class. Deep and profound class that may change how you live your life.
5,Reading philosophy used to be tedious before i took this class. Dr. Kreiglstein has a wonderful teaching style and a tremendous breath of knowledge. All the books he mentioned in class were great reads. The classes always seemed too short and I was always waiting for class next week. I would recommend this class as required learning for everyone.
4.5,A very wise man.
2.5,I am taking this class over the internet. There are 6 papers  a midterm and a final. As long as you answer all the questions for your paper  you will get an A.
1.5,Professor Goodman has not changed since these reviews started in 2003. Obnoxious amount of work. Taking this class online in conjunction with another class  with a fulltime job and a family is not recommended.
3,Let me preface saying I got a 98% in the class. BUT... it was the hardest I have worked in any class in a long time  especially online. To get a good grade  SUMMARIZE THE BOOK! If you are willing to put in the time  you can do well  but taking it in conjunction with other classes is an ill advised move.
3.5,I'm a business major and even though I got an A in this introductory internet-based business course  I did not have much fun. Sure it was nice doing work on my own time and learning about business as a whole  but there was little emotion or passion from Prof. Goodman. When we did have to meet in class it seemed pointless. But the class was easy.
5,Took her online managemnet class spring '08. It was the most work I've had in an online class but she grades very fair and if you do the work you should at the very least get a B. I got a pretty easy A and actually learned a lot. Take this class over the summer or when you have a lighter workload. Great class!
5,She does assign a lot of work  but she is very fair. If you do the work (and isn't this why it's called college) and you make an effort  you'll do well. She is very responsive and helpful. I would take her again.
4.5,I took her online Principles of Management class... and wrote a LOT of papers. Basically  do what she asks by outlining the book and make sure to touch upon every point and you'll get an A. Gives out extra credit points for adding comments on discussion board  and is a lenient enough grader. Write the same paper 10x and get an A.
3,I took an online course with her and she does give a lot of work but if you do the work you should get most of the credit. The assignments can be long and overwhelming but like I said if you do the work you will get an A. The assignments can be done very loosely  just writ to fill up space  to her its quantity over quality. You can get an A easy!
1,I took her Class two years ago through online. Biggest mistake I ever made in college! She is horrible and gives too much work. I sometime thought she was an english teacher while getting back the assignments. I dropped out because of the overwhelming work load at her course. If you are taking more than two classes make sure you don't have her.
1.5,Way too much homework. Doesn't offer any extra credit. Very picky! Strict internet course timeline.
5,Great teacher! Her online course was to the point  and she graded very fairly. This was my first online course I have ever taken and I got an A. I enjoyed having her as a teacher.
1,toooooo much damn work
3,The most unhappiest women I have ever seen ! She does not know to smile !
1,This lady just doesn't care  wants to be hard core  spoiling the classroom ambiance.
1,No Comments
2,I'm taking her business simulation class  and the homework was a full-load of pile. We had 7 in the group and now only 2 left  and both of us have to do all homework designed for 6 people and she wouldn't lack us off. Taking her class is challenging.
1,She is not very friendly. Phyllis seems to be unhappy all the time but I was never sure what the problem was. I would NEVER take another course with this lady.
5,REALLY smart guy! He's done this for a long time and it shows. All of his lectures are very clear and he explains everything perfectly. He gets really excited when we answer his questions and ask really intriguing questions. Awesome guy! Really helpful outside of class. Helps you find new ways to study efficiently. Sweet man who cares if you care!
5,Best first year Biology teacher. Really knows his stuff and knows the perfect way to explain everything so that you understand it. Very good at pacing himself. Also very helpful if you show concern.
4.5,Honestly  who you have for bio lecture doesn't really matter but Tudor. however tudor is a great instructor  always willing to help students  very old school.
5,Excellent professor and human being. His level of knowledge is amazing and can deliver it through his teaching. Warning: He expects a lot and is not as easy grader!
5,Hes an awesome professor. I had him as an advisor too. He is very descriptive in his teaching and is very helpful. Hes very accomodating when it comes to extra help. You can tell he really loves teaching biology. I would really recommend taking him. His class is tough and so are his quizzes/exams but its manageable.
4.5,Great teacher. He is very clear in class and really knows his stuff. He is a little intimidating because he does expect a lot from his students but his high expectations keep his students working hard. Worth the effort this class requires.
5,Great teacher! Not only is he adorable with an adorable accent  but he goes in depth and he helps out and as long as you take notes and pay attention you are FINE. Make sure to study your stuff and if you read the slides you are fine for quizzes. Text and slides for test.
4,Incredibly awesome guy  very helpful  but his expectations for a non-science major are unfair. Not one person in class was a business major and he expected 6 hours per week at least for studying outside the classroom and that we study it everyday. I would not take this class again given the chance. Plus it had a lab... and lab project!
4,Extremely helpful  intelligent  and nice professor! Makes himself readily available almost any time during business hours if he doesn't have a class or meeting. The problem is that he's very difficult and his expectations are unrealistic  especially for non-science majors. If you're a BIO major  I'd recommend him. Otherwise  I'd say no.
5,Don't listen to the bad reviews. Tudor really is the best teacher for Cells/Genetics. He is a very nice guy and very approachable which MANY of the bio professors at SJU aren't. The tests/quizzes and everything else are run by the bio dept not the individual teachers so they are the same in all the sections. Tudor's the best of them by far.
4,Good professor. Bio is tough  but he was pretty fair about it. Also had online review sessions before the test which were helpful.
5,Memorize the slides and you've got it made.
4,If you take the time to learn Klingon you can get an easy A.
4,Extremely difficult  but doable. Be prepared to study at least a couple of hours everyother night to stay on top of the subject. Between lecture and lab  you'll do about 12 hours of work a week just in bio. Do this and you MIGHT be ok. Take bio only if you are seriously into it.
2,Horrible. One of the hardest teachers i've ever had. No matter how much i studied i never passed his tests. I even had a tutor...nothing seemed to work.
4.5,This man is amazing! A little difficult to follow sometimes  but very helpful  very understanding. Awesome
5,Awesome teacher. Took him both semesters! Knows his stuff & likes the material. Bio is work but I would take him again in a heartbeat. Always posts his lectures & really wants you to learn & love bio as much as he does! Highly reccomended!!
5,Very helpful. Easy to go to for help.
4.5,Tudor is a nice man...if you need help  go to him for help. He appreciates that effort. Gives online help sessions before every exam. (He's not hot).
5,He's an excellent teacher  always willing to help. Lecture is very interesting. Be prepared to work hard. He is hottt!!!
5,"i really loved this professor!! He looked at the controversial issue/religion and man from all points of views. he brought the science into the religion by discussing the themes of social vs actual ailments. he was amazing! a great lecturer  very hot and unpretentious  very dramatic and moving  kept you intriuged with what he would do next. and i agree that ""he didn't take any crap from know-it-alls OR arrogant skeptics"". the essays were really hard  but it challenged your thinking."
5,One of the best professors I've had at UCSD. He is thoughtful and intriguing  although I think what he says goes straight over the heads of most  which is the fault of the closed minded student populace  not him.
5,my favorite professor so far. he may have changed my attitude towards life. if you're a christian  he might convert you to something else.
5,Droge was great. He really knows his stuff and makes you think for yourself. The classes are challenging and entertaining.
5,excellent professor
4.5,i liked him he was an inspiring professor.
4,I can't believe all these people didn't like him  were we in the same class? Droge totally had a point to everything he said. A lot of fun  very entertaining  hecka weird. Sorta offensive  don't take it personally. Really appreciated him a quarter lat
2,He's not a good teacher at all. You do get the essay questions before the test  but they are very vague. His lectures are SO BORING I can't concentrate. Don't take him  his class is ridiulous. He likes to hear his own voice. And He's really ugly and old.
3,He has a wonderful way of presenting himself and I think that he fulfills his duties as a professor. He does an amazing job keeping the class interested (at least with my class) and I didn't mind the view from front row : )
1.5,boring and a joke. his lectures suck and are hard to take anything away from them
3,his lectures are either really intriguing or extremely boring!!!!!!!!! he doesn't find that medium or balance and he almost seems biased most of the time...i'd be careful about taking him... but he does his job
2,Worst teahcer I've had so far. He rambles on forever and no one has a clue what he is talking about. Very confusing lectures and is very difficult to take notes on. Don't waste your time trying to stay awake in his class.
5,very enthusiastic and engaging... and smokin' hot.
1,Note how all the good ratings are based on sex or passionate . Ew  ew  ew.
5,droge is passionate and very intelligent. overall a cool guy.
1,the guy just likes to hear himself talk...doesn't teach or lecture  just rambles
5,SEXY!!!! And an AMAZING lecturer!! Taken all of his classes!
3,Although a good lecturer  he's extrememly biased and unfair on essays.
5,HOT  HOT  HOT. Sexy  smart  and gorgeous. Take anything he teaches!
5,I have taken several online classes-1 of the most fantastic classes I have taken! I'm CD major but we learned so much in such short time. The lectures & videos were great. Shout out to Prof Benavides! for being so organized  contacting us 2 see how we are doing  caring about us & motivating & pushing us. we learned about ourselves  family & life!!
5,I learned so much from taking this class and I really enjoyed it! She gives ppt lectures and provides links to articles and videos to help with the lecture. She truly cares about her students' success. Just do the reading  take notes  keep up with the discussions  and wou will do well in the tests.
5,I learned so much in this class  at first it was overwhelmingly  but she gives you linked learning to videos and her lecture notes with examples. I found it fascinating that I not only understood about the developing child and adolescence  but about myself. I loved the inspirational messages and reminders that she included in her announcements.
5,She's as awesome as everybody says. She truly cares for her students and goes above and beyond to further assist in learning the material. She sends reminders  listens to her students needs  and always motivates her students. As long as you do your part  you'll do great. Must take her class if you're looking into taking a child development class.
5,The information I have learned is unbelievable. I take classes and get tested and forget the information. But Mrs. B relates the theory to actual teaching practices - and I understand the picture.
5,She's a great instructor and really goes out of her way to help the students out. I took her years ago and could still call her for any help that I may need (in the field of child development of course) We created a portfolio in class which has been with me since and has help me greatly to obtain a job.(emloyers have been impressed) thanks Julie
5,So much stiumlating info on teaching. I'm a better teacher because of her. She goes the extra mile but expects a lot from you.
5,Fun. Educational. Caring. Hands on. goes the extra mile.
5,Ms. Benavides is very clear and easy to understand. She makes the class fun to be in. She genuenly cares about her student and what they are learning. Take her if you get the chance. GO MS B.
5,Great Child Development instructor! Will go out of her way to help any student.
1,The things that I could say about this woman. I could go on for days. Probably a great nurse in the field  but absolutely neurotic in class. Reads straight from slides
2,You can tell that she definitely knows what she is talking about  but lecture is ridiculously long and boring. She goes off on random tangents and many lectures she only goes over 10 or 11 slides because she is so long winded. Tests are hard  but they prepare you for NCLEX. I thought the paper was the toughest as she is an APA format freak.
3,Test day is a nightmare. She is very concerned with making sure it is done 100% correct  which is fine  but she can come across as very rude about it. She touched my arm and lifted my sleeve to look for a watch. The tests weren't that bad honestly. The paper was more difficult for me. She is very specific about APA format  so be careful with that.
1,Ida seems like a great nurse don't get me wrong  however  her class sucks. Her tests are ridiculously hard and her lectures are extremely boring. She reads straight off the powerpoint so I could've not even shown up for class but had to. The exams are all definitions of basically the same words. I hate that this class is a pre-nursing class.
1,These pre-nursing classes were the reason I decided nursing was not for me. Your grade is dependent almost entirely on 2 exams and a final. The tests are ridiculous with definitions and random questions over APA format and god knows what. She walks around  and stands over you while you test. She is the only option  but I would not recommend.
3,You can tell from class that Dr. Slusher is definitely a good nurse and knows the information she is teaching. However  she is very tough to please in class. Her tests are the hardest out of the pre-nursing classes. All the answers can be right  but you have to pick the one that is the most right. You definitely have to work for your grade.
2,Ida... you can tell she is an amazing nurse and an even better woman. You can tell outside of class she is very nice... but in class is different. During exams she puts tissues in your face  takes your jacket  and once made me move my arm because I guess I could be cheating??? The class is hard  dont get me wrong  but it is definitely doable. STUDY
4,Dr. Slusher deserves a lot more credit than most people give her. She is someone I look up to for her accomplishments in nursing. She is a professor that cares about the future of nursing and wants you to succeed. Slusher will prepare you for the rest of your nursing program and career. Lecture heavy  funny  intelligent  & has high expectations.
3,As this professor was the only professor teaching the course  I had no option but to take her class. She seems to mean well and I'm sure she is well respected in the Nursing world  but it was impossible to meet with her one on one and she failed to email me back a few times. Be prepared to study and pay attention in class or you will not pass.
2,"Where do i even start... she's terrible. You have 3 tests and they're all hard considering the fact that she gives you 4 correct answers and you have to choose the ""most"" correct answer. Make sure you understand APA front and back because she tears apart your paper for literally everything. no point of going to class- she reads off the PP."
2,Dr. Slusher wouldn't accept a hand written love letter from Channing Tatum if it wasn't APA format. She is crazy for the rules and reads the PowerPoint word by word everyday (good luck dealing with her voice). Tests are common sense  but difficult because there are 3 right answers but you need to pick the 'best' one
1.5,Better study because there are 4 tests and one paper. That's it. That's the whole class. Lectures are pointless  she reads off the PowerPoint (which btw are bright blue in lime green writing. Hard to read) and I only went for attendance.
2.5,Having Slusher's class (along with the other two pre-nursing courses) were a major wake up call for me. I was used to making A's and ended up making B's in all three of the courses. The tests are confusing  you basically have to choose the answer she'd want you to. She grades the paper really strictly so make sure you take it to the LRC beforehand.
2.5,She's not very helpful. Ask her a specific question and you may or may not get an answer. Tough grader. She can also be rude. At least she likes what she does.
3.5,Before I say anything else I liked Ida as a Human. Ida is the nurse that would've administered Zyklon B to the Jews  but only if the APA formatting was correct. Ida is the definition of a bureaucrat. She wastes 1/4 of semester covering syllabus/student handbook/APA formatting. PON paper is about format  tests are MOSTLY power-point.
5,Great teacher.
5,Dr. Slusher is everything you want in your nursing professor--tremendous depth of knowledge  clarity in delivering the material  great examples from her personal experience  humor  ability to make. Neither content nor the grading will leave you questioning her teaching. And she brings candy!
2.5,She's knows her stuff but I did not enjoy having her as my professor. She is rude. I could have made a better grade if I had known how to study. The questions in the back of the Fundamentals of Nursing book were helpful but you do best by studying the powerpoints. 1st test was mainly over the syllabus... Be sure to study.
4.5,Dr Slusher is passionate about her work and nursing as a profession. I have personally enjoyed learning a about h e r experiences. She provides examples pertinent to content she is teaching and encourages class participation enhancing optimal learning. She sets high expectations for student success and accountability which I admire and applaud.
1,Dr. Slusher is one of the rudest professors I have ever had. She is the exact reason why I am changing my major this semester. She grades the semester paper extremely difficult. She treats her students like they do not matter. The exams are rough. She will tell you something will be on the exam  and it wont be.
4.5,His class was a lot of work - a reading and a writing assignment for every class. The great part is the class is over before you know it. He is a fair  but not easy grader. He's a very compassionate person and it will help your grade if you agree with those sentiments.
5,Nicest man ive ever met in my life. all of his papers for Religion in Literature were about ourselves. It helped you figure out who you were as a person and it was a very helpful course to take during my freshman year of college. I have nothing but great things to say about him and his class.
5,A very good and passionate teacher. He really cares about the material and is very helpful and compassionate toward students. Nicest guy in the world!
5,So Great!!!!!
5,Knows his subject very well. Really cares about writing & literature. Very fair with grades.
5,Nonviolent warrior was a great class! I especially liked his lectures on Gandhi  MLK Jr.  and Leo Tolstoy. This is a good way to get the IDS requirement out of the way.
3.5,Cool class. I had lots of fun just talking about myself and talking about classmate's works. I liked the silent movie. I can't believe he's gonna be chaplain now!
5,Awesome prof. I've learned so much about me and my writing through his teaching. Creative Writing is such an awesome class!
4,much learning from him
3,Avoid his class if possible.
5,CREATIVE WRITTING WAS THE EASIEST AND BEST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN AT ALBRIGHT
1,Non violent warior is so boring
2,No Comments
2.5,Prof DEFINITELY knows his Greek  but seemed bored while teaching it at this introductory level... like he always would prefer to be elsewhere. Very gracious in allowing retests  but could benefit from a bit more time spent upfront in assuring students are onboard.
3,He knows a lot about the New Testament
4.5,So sweet and approachable. One of the best professors ever.
4,Nonviolent warrior had EXTREMELY boring lectures. over explain things  he will keep you the full 3 hours and 15 minutes
3.5,Men in Transition is an easy A
5,Kenney and Clark are a great pair. They're OK
3.5,STAY AWAY!!! VERY BORING
3,No Comments
3.5,No Comments
2,Ce prof ne structure aucunement sa matiere  autant au niveau du plan de cours qu'en classe. En plus avec un receuil de notes incomplet (fait par lui) et vous obtenez un cours extrement facile auquel vous ne comprenez rien... Le livre optionnel est obligatoire avec lui.
4.5,C'est un professeur qui n'endort pas. Les exemples qu'ils donnent sont tout ce qu'il y a xc3xa0 retenir pour rxc3xa9ussir les examens...
5,Nice professor!
3,Le prof est sympathique et aidant (hors-classe)  mais son cours est assez disparate! En effet  essayer de suivre le fil de son discours est trxc3xa8s difficile... Il ne suit pas vraiment le plan de cours et semble toujours avoir une anecdote hors-sujet xc3xa0 dire. Mais xc3xa0 la base  le cours est facile: Faite vos lectures et surtout les exos de la semaine!
2.5,Pretentieux.
2.5,Utterly mean  pretentious and obnoxious.
3.5,The class is a handful of small lab reports that can be graded tough  lab notebook checks  and participation. The participation grade can save you. He is very sweet  wants to help  and is very considerate. He is incredibly intelligent so sometimes his lectures are over student's heads.
4,Very tough grader! A very goof professor though! Explains everything very clear. You MUST study every night to pass his tests. His tests might not seem too hard but trust me they are very difficult! Would recommend him to anyone but you must be willing to dedicate A LOT of time to this class.
4.5,Very clear and great in lecture. He grades his tests tough but if you know the notes and do all of the practice problems they aren't that bad.
4.5,Clear lectures and notes. If you cover the review sheets that he GIVES you  you will do fine. Very helpful and great explainer. Would take him again.
5,Took him for Genetics. He was a fantastic teacher. I've taken the class with other teachers and thought that Genetics was harder. With Lissemore- I actually got an A. Recommend him ALL The way. If you have the choice  TAKE HIM  you won't regret it. Prefer him over other bio teachers in the department  too.
3.5,It was a very rough class. One thing to know about this guy is that he grades harshly. Exams were difficult (e.g. he expects you to memorize word for word definitions from the chapter and reproduce it on the exam). He also had reading assignments for in-class discussions regarding bioethics which were pointless and time consuming.
5,Lectures are clear and interesting - he is a good teacher and you'll learn a lot. Grades aren't just based on exams
4.5,Dr. Lissemore is the best. he will do anything for his students  and works extremely hard for you. Be prepared to work hard as well  and come to learn. Any class he teaches is completely worth your time.
3.5,Pros:Always prepared  explains things clearly  well thoughtout powerpoints  clear detailed assignment handouts  spends more time helping students more than office hours require  you will learn alot Cons: Not objective in grading  unreasonably picky  assigns busy work  picks favorite students  dominates convo  you might not get the grade you deserve
2.5,tests are impossible! i would walk out of an exam thinking i did very well but when i recieved it back  i basically did very poorly. he's very picky with any answer given on a test or exam!!!!
5,Best class I have taken at JCU. Best class to prepare you for grad school. If you make this class a priority and put in the time  you will definately learn a lot. Exams are hard  because they really challenge you to think in a short amount of time.
4,Extremely tough grader and gives no breaks. Make sure you pay attention to that syllabus  because he follows it word-to-word and gives no chances... unless your dog died and you have a death certificate to prove it. Hard exams but the project is cool (for the Biological Impacts of Poverty Class). You will work your ass off in this class.
5,Jim is a great guy
5,Dr. L. will tell you everything you need to know  if you do the suggested homework you can definitely do well--you need the book for homework. This class is awesome.
5,This guy is GREAT... I don't care what anyone else says... he takes time to make things crystal clear... and would be glad to help if you go and see him... he never tests you on anything he doesn't cover (you don't really need a book)... the class is challenging... but if you're into this stuff you may find it easy...
4.5,Dr. Lissemore knows his genetics  and his history. The class is very difficult and requires patience to understand and comprehend- but worthwhile learned a lot in a short time! BTW this material is on the MCAT and if you want to take that you need this class  and he will definately prep you for that
1.5,This guy has no idea what he's doing...if he doesn't understand  you're wrong...doesn't cross his mind that maybe you know something he doesn't...I'm really not sure that a guy who is not up-to-date with new genetic testing and studies should be teaching about it!
5,Although the subject matter was extremely difficult  this guy makes it clear and fun to learn. Very helpful and always willing to sit down with you and thoroughly answer all questions. Gives you note packets too  so you don't have to write!
4,one of the best professors I have ever had! class is extremely structured. effort is required. learned a lot from his class. nice guy too.
3,Too many kids drop his class to say he's doing it right. If so many kids fail a test  something is wrong  cause its not bc they don't try.
1,Probablement le pire prof de toute l'histoire des profs... Aprxc3xa8s avoir assistxc3xa9 xc3xa0 2 cours  on constate vite qu'il vaut mieux lire les notes de cours (mises xc3xa0 jour en 1987 !!!) Il fait des bruits bizares en classe et on dirait qu'il est toujours sur le point de crever. Lxc3xa2ches-pas vieille croute  tu achxc3xa8ves...
1.5,A BORING teacher  believe me  with absolutely no gift to teach anything. He is one of the worst teacher ever and can even makes the most interesting subject into a thing you wouldn't hear about anymore. By the way  he is a specialist at giving you critical information at the last moment (like the place of an exam 2 hours before it)
1.5,Is convinced that open book exams make it quicker to perform matrix computations. Lectures will put you in hibernating state!
5,Bonne prof!!
5,A pleasant personality  diligent and dynamic I thoroughly enjoy working with her on my Master's project. She is vesatile in all branches of computer engineering and always willing to give a hand when needed. To sum it all up  what an amazing prof.

1,A Shallow professor  never answer questions . . .helpless in ragards to questions concerning labs . . .It is a real waste of time to study MLMDA with so who is not interested by MLMDA. . .better if she taeches Biomedicale ou autre chose ...
5,She is the best teacher ever!
5,Une des meilleurs profs de poly sans contre-dit. elle a une bonne energie positive qu'elle resussie a transmettre a ses etudiant. Jamais de mauvaise humeur  elle a tjr le temps pour ses etudiant  ce qui est franchement pas le cas pour les autres profs de poly.
5,Comme la critique prxc3xa9cxc3xa9dente mentionne : trxc3xa8s souriante  ouverte aux discussions/questions. Malheureusement  le cours thxc3xa9orique ne sert qu'xc3xa0 fournir des colles pour les examens (qui ne comptent pour rien comparxc3xa9s au projet). C'est justement dans le projet que l'on apprend le plus! Un conseil : N'hxc3xa9sitez pas xc3xa0 vous investir xc3xa0 fond dans le projet!
4.5,Prof souriante  toujours de bonne humeur et prxc3xaate xc3xa0 donner de l'aide (en personne ou par courriel). Dommage que le cours soit aussi peu utile  les sxc3xa9ances de TP sont bien plus productives (on apprend toutefois bien plus par soi-mxc3xaame qu'avec les chargxc3xa9s de lab trop peu disponibles).
3.5,A good professor  helpful and smiling but the course are sometimes a little bit boring.
5,She is so nice  always smiling and so helpful. She is very good teacher and specially to direct students in master and phd.

5,She's the best  really nice  helpful  and attentive to every student!
5,Very bright  very insightful  very helpful woman. A fine advisor for final year projects or graduate studies. Very  very sweet.
4.5,sweet woman...genuinly nice
3.5,He wasn't clear about what he wanted. If you want an A  make sure that the shapes you draw are neat and there are no messes outside and inside of the border. No matter how ugly your painting is  he accepts it as long as it's neat and it is based on the guidelines. He also lets you to redo any assignment and turn it in.
4,He is an amazing teacher and so understanding. I'm not an art major & didn't know anything about art or how to draw. He helped me so much. I ended up getting an A because he saw how hard I tried although my work wasn't as good as the others. I enjoyed his class. You need to be very neat he's picky. Be prepared to spend a lot of money on materials.
4.5,Wessel is the best. very helpful and explains everything that will be on the midterm and final. The class is counted by points. There are a lot of projects. one essay.
5,I have learned a lot. I really like him.
5,He is AWESOME!!!!!! He is very creative  very helpful and very knowledgeable. I have taken all the classes Mark teaches at GCC and Ixe2x80x99m extremely happy that I did so. If you are an art student  you will always have use fore everything you learn in his classes no matter if itxe2x80x99s the Color Theory or Design class. His Color Theory class is just grate an
4.5,Wessel really knows his stuff. He teaches at other campuses as well  so he seems to have experience. Very funny guy  really gets you excited. Great direction. If you need a little bit more help he is willing and able. Materials for this class were over $100 easy which may be high. I'm not sure as this is my first art class. But they were all needed
5,One of the best teachers I have ever had. Better than 90% of the teachers I had at a certain unnamed private college I paid $100 000 to attend. Wessel is articulate  knowledgeable  friendly  and passionate about what he does. He makes a 4-hour class fun and enjoyable. True  that there is a lot of homework but  come on folks! It's college!
5,mr. wessel is a wonderful teacher! a true artist that has a lot of knowledge about the craft. you will learn a lot about design and the tools of the trade in this class. he is friendly and communicates very well.
5,He is a very nice teacher  you can get an A if you pay close attention on what he is really asking you to make/design. This was a very fun and cool class.
5,He is an AWESOME teacher. His class was a prerequisite to classes I really wanted to take. He made the class fun. He really is a good teacher.
5,he is a great teacher. He lectures well. The class was challenging for me but it was fun. r His grading system is detailed and fair.r you certainly learn the basics of design quite well in his class. I would take any class from him again for sure.
4.5,you certainly learn a lot in his class - a little too much homework but it is all worth end of the term. his grading is fair and his lectures are great!
5,No Comments
5,He is an excellent art teacher. I had lots of fun in his class and it wasn't hard at all. If you take art 130 you need to have good craft to do well  but his assignments are very fun. The class is very enjoyable and he is a person you can easily talk to.
3,"Very good instructor and specific about his expectations. Would take another class from him any time. If you don't like to follow directions  don't expect to do well (""artistic license"" comes in upper division class  not foundation ones)."
3,Professor Sposito isn't a blindingly brilliant lecturer but he gets the information across clearly. He really cares about the subject  I think  but just isn't the most interesting lecturer. He does post lecture slides on bCourses which really helps with exam preparation.
5,Classes like this are the reason I came to this school. Brilliant  kind  interested  engaged professor who goes above and beyond to facilitate learning. Often wished lectures wouldn't be over so quickly! This class is friendly to science and humanities students  it's creative and thought provoking if you go in with the right mind.
5,One of the two best teachers I've had at Cal. He's very  very smart  and he explains science in a way that's easy for humanities types like me to understand. Super-nice guy too. Highly recommended!
4,I liked Prof. Sposito a lot. Even though I took this class for Hass  I found myself enjoying Sposito's lectures a lot more. He was organized  passionate  and really laid back. You get the feeling he really cares about the subject and his students.
2,Boring lecturer  too much reading. He was equally unfocused(as Hass 0 but the class wasn't hard. Study guides for all tests  writing assignments were easy. Lecture was just horribly monotonous and totally useless  rarely went.
1.5,Boring monotonous lecturer. He could have made the material so much more exciting. He always talked up the guest speakers to the point where it sounded fake. too much reading! but midterms aren't hard.
4,Cross-listed as EnglishC77 & UGIS12
1.5,Lectures are not well organized. Textbook is terrible. Not helpful via e-mail. Not in scheduled office hours.
4,This class wasn't bad. I enjoyed some of the readings in the reader. Did not realize it was cross listed with ENGLISH before I took it. Too much literary analysis involved for a CRS major like myself. I got the English GSI  so I felt like she graded my essays strictly. Get the espm/science GSIs if you're more science inclined. (and vice versa)
4,Professor Sposito is fantastic. He makes environmental studies fascinating and painless for students who aren't necessarily excited about science. He also brings in some amazing guest lecturers.
4.5,he's a great envi sci professor because he doesn't make you feel depressed about the subject. he wants to inspire you to help save the planet. you should take this class  it's one of a kind.
1,I think he is still in class to...pass the time away. He calls so many other people to talk in class. I think he is lazy.
4.5,No joke  I developed a crush on him because he was so passionate about his work  his students and the environment. AWESOME GUY! Wow. I actually miss attending his lectures...
5,Sposito is great! Very knowledgable  clear  insightful  dedicated. He's just great.
5,Excellent professor. Very passionate about the subject and full of interesting information. Very friendly and approachable. This class was the bright spot in my otherwise awful schedule.
5,He was such a great teacher! So understanding and very helpful! I learned so much from him!!! TAKE HIM!!!
5,Clear  intelligent  and a delight to work with.
5,Dazzling intellect and a concern for students not often seen at Cal.
5,Great Prof. Who's knowledge is second hand to none so far of those who I've met so far in my life. Grading scale is clear. Will stay as long as you need after class to help you on ANYTHING you need. Even offers to help students with other classes if he can. I've had him for a couple classes  I've learned a lot from him.
1.5,Kind of BLAH!! He teaches science  and really thought more about his science classes then our math class. Felt stupid in this class! Felt stupid because of the teacher!!
5,He teaches Science and is very knowledgeable in science and make class fun and the labs are fun also. Took both of my sciences with him. He's get you to think.
1.5,I didnt learn anything about math  other then how to get frustrated  unmotivated and just sad!! Getting good GPA is imporntan to me  and this class totally killed it!! Not all teachers fault  but I felt like I was board  and very frustrated with Gilles. I felt he looked down on the math beginers people who didnt have a or first timers in college
3.5,Bob has a fantastic understanding of calculus. Sometimes he doesn't notice if you need him to slow down or go over something again. Be assertive and he'll help.
5,Great teacher wicked easy and supper helpful I loved every min o his class and he is writing the text book so there is no book to buy! SUPPER PLUS!
5,what a great prof. if you want to learn and advence into calc 3 this is the one who will give you the right knowlage to integrate and learn something valuable that will come handy on your next calc class. very smart and fun prof. loves teaching you new stuff.
1,I had this guy last year and let me tell you that after every class I would go to my car and start crying. He made me feel stupid  and pretty much I was board but still tried very hard!!! I was SO FRUSTRATED!!! Again I left almost every class in tears!
1,Gillies is just a bad teacher. Plain and simple just bad! Horrible  I was SOOOO unmotivated by his teachings  I was just at a loss. One of my first college classes  and I wanted to quit college  because of how bad of a teacher he is. Like if your a strong math or science student I think youll do fine  he just created way to much anxity for me!!
1,Bad  Bad  Bad!!!! thats it
2,I hated this class. He was very fast-paced and not a good teacher. Grade was based on tests only... no homework  attendence or participation taken into consideration.
1,OK first I just have to say my dad is a high school math teacher so in addition for going to extra help in the math center I still could not get modivated for this class. He is very monotone. He was very boring I would go home and have my dad teach me. Gillies talks about to much science  I mean its a basic algera class  not med school.Horroable
1,I didnt like him. I think is was very boring. Grented it was math  but still.
5,Lost the boat with the physics. Too MUCH PHYSICS. Stop it with the drawings! Take class if you like to tackle engineering projects. Do not take class if you have any form of sanity  whatsoever. Not a math class and do not learn much. However  he knows how to teach and for the right student  well done.
5,got me into math...got me into calc...got me into WPI...best math tacher ever.....and he's a physicist not a mathmatician...I love it
5,Best math teacher I ever had. Also teaches some of the history of mathematics  this is extra knowledge that is hard to find anywhere. Nice  Nice professor.
5,this guy will bend over backwords to make sure you understand the material and that you pass the class. and the fact that he gives you photocopies of the notes is key.
3.5,Very interesting course  although Cathy says it's the last time she'll teach it. Make sure to attend every class- attendance is a big factor. Also  keep up with readings and responses because they account for the majority of your mark. There was a lot of time for personal reflection  which was enjoyable. Good class :-)
4,She is boring. She is clear  easy  and helpful though. She always keeps you until the last minute. She isn't much fun. Sometimes seems to fake an interest in the material.
4.5,Cathy rocks! She cares about her students and whats he's teaching about. She even gives us her cell number in case we need her! how cool is that! She's deffinitly the BEST @ STU!
5,Excellent Prof. Keeps things energetic and fun. Is very interested in peoples theories and opinions. Very fun class  I love it!
5,I just loved her  the best professor I ever had. She has so much enthusiasm and created such a pleasant environment. She even hosted a party at the end of the year for our class. The very best at STU!!
4.5,She's awsome! She listens to what you have to say without critisizing and is truly interested in what she is teaching. The class is a breeze and her lectures are actually interesting!
5,excellent prof. very helpfull and friendly. lectures are interesting and group work is fun. one of the best classes I've taken.
4.5,I lover her. She's very interested in what she's going  and when we have group discussions she sometimes sits with us and just talks to us like regular people. I really recommend her  she's a great person.
3.5,She's a feminist  but not in an idiotic way. She's good once you get used to her style - nice.

5,Why did they let her go?
1,Completely worthless class did not learn anything. Her critisims of your speech is vague and plays favorites with her class. If she likes you  you will get a good grade. If you do not show the level of interst that she believes you should you are in for a long semester. Wish I had taken Steele instead.
1,.....worthless-
5,Awesome awesome teacher and they should let her stay.

5,Glad I had her as a teacher for frs140. It was a stupid class  but she really helped a lot and all we ever did was talk in her class. She had a genuine interest in our opinions and ideas. Very fun and Energetic person.
5,Dr. Moss makes school fun!!! sweetest and most energetic teacher ever!!!
3.5,"A little scatter brained. Says ""Ummmm"" every sentence. NOT FOR SLACKERS! She expects the very best from EVERYONE"
5,Expects a lot  but will help. Slackers beware.
3,No Comments
3.5,She's definitely an energetic teacher! She's helpful  all you have to do is ask.
5,Hello Andrea: I was a student of yours at UCLA and liked and admired you teaching very much. Thank you  I still remember what you taught. Bill Williams  UCLA 1967  JD 1971
2,Tyree is a huge bore. She will put you to sleep!!! Most of the time shes very unorganized. Plays with her laptop for half the class and talks about google earth  which did not help teach anything about population and society.Her test questions are given to you before the exams but they require thorough reading.Take if u MUST. otherwise stay away
3,shes nice but a complete space cadet who goes off on tangents all the time. her tests are hard and she grades harshly- but she curves at the end which is good. the class is soooo boring i wouldnt reccommed it unless u are actually interested in it.
2.5,had her for 320...sweet lady loves what she does...boring lectures  tedious work assigned  essay tests (must read text in order to do well in this class) goes on tangents most of the time...attendance is mandatory...dont recommend this class
5,this professor's class is easy. She explains computer assignments using a program known as spss in easy to follow steps. Good attendance is a must cause a lot of the lecture material as well as class readings ends up on essay exams. If you take the optional final your lowest grade is dropped. Your lowest computer hw grade is dropped.
4,HIGHLY Recommend for research methods No text  No annoying group work  essay exams. I admit you will feel kind of lost in the class sometimes in lab but u will see in the end she is so much better than other research methods professors. If you don't understand speak up she is understanding and helps during office hours
5,definitely an easy A the tests are essay exams and she give you the 5 questions a week before the exam. do them prior to the test and you will get a good grade she is an easy grader.
3,space cadet  but easy A
3.5,It's hard to understand her  so I suggest sitting in front of the class. Her lectures tend to be a bit boring  but she's a fair grader. All her tests are essays (and she gives you possible questions before hand so you can prepare). Easy A!
3.5,Very easy class since teacher talks about one fact per test and each class is examining the same thing again and again. Very boring but worth the time for an A
4.5,Her population class is extremely easy. There is no textbook just a couple readings that are easy to understand. There is a portfolio due at the end of the semester but that is extremely easy. And the best part is that she will drop your lowest test grade including the final!! And her exams are easy
1,can't understand a word the woman says
3,Despite the negative comments posted on here about the professor he is a very nice guy. He has a thick german accent that makes it difficult at times to understand the lesson but he makes things clear enough to understand. DO THE HOMEWORK AND EXTRA CREDIT. The tests are easier than the homework so if you pass these you should be fine :)
3.5,Everyone here seems to be giving hi bad reviews but he's really a nice guy. He's a little bit hard to understand but you get used to it. Tests are really easy and there's usually a big curve. Do the homework and you'll get a good grade. I loved him.
4.5,I really like him. Atfirst he may seem offputting  but he's really nice. Math is math  it's not fun. But he knows many people are taking it for the DEC  so there are several opportunities for extra credit. He also realizes and states in class that not everyone will do so great on the second midterm and the curve will be generous. (85 = A)
3.5,Although he does get a bit incomprehensible at times  he is a pretty good math teacher. I am rather sure I am getting am A in his class and although sometimes I don't go for reasons that I just don't want to or emergencies  I never feel like I fell too far behind. Rock on Detlef!!
4.5,He's a really good guy who's very intelligent. Yeah  he talks like Arnold a bit but it's funny. The people who commented bad stuff about him are probably idiots who don't know how to pay attention for more than 5 minutes. Really good guy  not a hard class.
1,this guy was horrible...point blank...i would ask him a question..he would answer a different question..WACK!!!!!!!
1,He doesnt teach well  he talks to the board and doesnt answer questions. he wont help you if you have a problem with your grade and he isn't very organized.
1,Don't do this to yourself!! Seriously. He's a horrible teacher. Absolutely horrible. He gets mad when students ask questions and he disgards questions most of the time. He is so lost on what he's teaching... he def will not help at all!!
1.5,I have no idea why math teachers keep getting more and more ridiculous  this professor is very hard to understand and at random points during his lecture runs of in tangents about other things. He is fast paced and due to the difficult  dragging lectures [which i left feeling stupider if anything] i reluctantly decided to p/nc theclass:( not happy!
2,This professor was incredibly boring. While teaching the class he talks to the blackboard...and you can only understand every other word. Believe me if you're have a hard time with math this prof. is def. NOT the prof. for you!
1,worst professor ever. he speaks to the board  mumbles  makes mistakes often  can't explain things to the class  gets frustrated when he's asked questions  barely speaks english. HORRIBLE! despite all of that the only reason I got an A was because it was easy math. but going to class made me want to hurl an eraser at his head.
1,I went twice and got an A. As long as you do the HW you will be fine and the math is a joke. However  the two times that I did go  I wanted to jump out the window  he is awful. He mumbles  speaks awful english and gets frustrated after the second question. But take the class for the easy MATH/DEC credit  trust me.
4,He's okay. He gives you many opportunities to raise your grade. If you do your work  you will probably do fine.
3.5,This post is for those students who are serious about math. If you can take a 300 level course with him do so! He teaches and he gives you every chance in the world to do well. His exams are out of 105 points but 80 is considered a perfect score. He also gives extra credit projects if you need them. Good class  good teacher. Take him!
5,best teacher...such a cute guy and very smart and nice! knows his math
2,He's such a sweet guy and seems genuinely crushed that no one comes to his lectures. Attending recitation and getting good grades on exams is all you really need
2,The guy is smart but can't teach for his life. The math is EASY and the book is very good. So if your even decent at math then definitly take this course. Subjects include compounding interest  probability  election theory  etc.
2,he is hard to understand because of his accent. if you do all of the work  attend recitations  and do the extra credit at the end (which isn't hard0 you will get at least a B. I am horrible at math and my tests were horrible in the class and i pulled off a B.

3,Having graduated 12 years ago  now  Dr. Chinn is one of the Trinity professors I look back on ith the most fondness. I took Intro.  Chinese Phil.  and Logic from him and always found him to be kindhearted and humorous.
1,I have no idea how this man became the Chair. Smart guy  but his teaching skills are horrible beyond belief. Never makes himself available.
2.5,It's really hard to understand him since he mumbles and slurs all his words - and then when he writes a word on the board it's illegible. If you read you'll figure the stuff out  though.
1.5,wtf is he saying?
4,I disagree with the other people's comments. He takes a very subtle approach to teaching it  but asian philosophy is a very subtle subject. He really cares about the subject and gives a lot of leeway when it comes to picking your paper topics. Not boring.
3,This class was alright. I mean  Bored outta your mind is better than wishing you took an easier class...
1,Worst teacher I've ever had...never available for help  boring and completely inarticulate. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
4.5,I thought Dr. Chinn was very approachable and helpful. The area of philosophy isn't clear to begin with  and I think the way he teaches it is more helpful than memorizing terms out of a book.
1,Was very excited about this class  but ended up hating it. Lectures and thoughts are very unorganized. I attended every class and don't feel like I have learned a thing. It was a total waste of time and money.
1,It seems that Professor Chinn values his own opinions only. Even more unfortunate  it is nearly impossible to understand his opinions because he cannot articulate himself. He is also completely unhelpful.
4,Great prof helpful
2,I can't believe a marketing prof is teaching managerial economics. Ah well  he's not overall a bad prof  just not organized  poorly structured exams and very  very boring. When his class got audited by the chair  the dude fell asleep lol. Make sure to review the textbook and practice all the calculus or you'll do poorly on exams.
5,One of the best profs i've had. I had him for both qms classes last year. Anyone that says his midterms are tough clearly needs to sit down and study harder. His midterms are nothing but fair  i got a 100 percent on one of them. He really wants to help his students  so he goes over the material really well. I would defiantly recommend taking him!
2.5,Such a tough prof!
5,He tries to be funny but he is'nt!!He is a tough prof!his midterm and finla are sooooooo hard!
5,EASYY PEASY!....
5,awesomee teacher...super easy...tests are exactly what he says they will be in class...this is my 2nd time takin stats the first one i had with jason...nirmal is EASIER!!!!
5,Just work hard  and attend classes
5,I had him again for 202  still the same nice prof. Content is slightly tougher  but not bad. He ensures ppl understands and sometimes adds some humor. Quizzes were easy  but his midterm was tough- most of the class suffered. But he was fair on marking the SPSS project and Quiz 2. Just practice the HW Qs and ask help (he's helpful btw) when needed.
5,He is a very good teacher  good speaker and funny too. Most of his quizzes you just need the calculator which he teaches how to use. Goes over the examples in class well. Got 85% before exam but after i jsut dropped. He co-wrote the exam but it was way too hard in my opinion. Most people that had A going in  dropped to Bs and Cs
5,People who are saying he's hard are probably really dumb. This course is a joke  especially with him. The calculator does everything for you. His midterm/quizzes are SUPER easy  just attend class and study off his examples and you'll get a 4.33 easily. He's a really good prof and is also very funny. I highly recommend taking him for stats 102/202!
3.5,This guy's tests are ridiculously hard  most of the time I didn't understand what he was asking for on the tests. Studying from the textbook didn't help at all.
5,Very nice and enthusiastic professor. His midterm/quizzes are pretty easy. He is very helpful when you don't understand some questions. Even though he summarizes the textbook  read and do the questions and you will be fine.
4,Definitely explains everything the fullest  tried to be funny and make the class entertaining but like it is qms it never will be but good for trying. tests are fair and pretty easy course cause he doesnt complicate things
5,Best prof i ever had! after failing QMS 202  i took the course again and got an A!! He is very patient and explains until you fully understand. He would review the material learned in the previous class and give good examples. If you attend his classes  you will be fine!
5,So surprised at the ratings this prof has recieved! He is an amazing teacher he explains very well if you go to class and take notes you will do great! He never tries to trick you and tests and exams are very easy! Great prof overall!
3,Mixed review  as his explanations are hard to understand  but he is a very dedicated professor who gives lots of support  posts tonnes of stuff  and seems enthusiastic. He wont be a hinderance at all  but the text pretty much teaches most things you need to know. But i lol'd when he failed a basic stats question in front of the class
3.5,He's an airhead who doesn't teach well. He makes mistakes during class and confuses you during class. Stick to the book  sleep during class  and you'll be fine.
4,This guy is awsome. Hard to understand yes  but posts many helpful solutions on blackboard  and our section covered 2 addtional chapters that no other qms class covered and we all failed but gave us opportunities by changing the weight of our final according to which we'd get the highest possible grade. Above all I think this prof is very helpful.
4.5,He's a very good prof. If stats is not your area of expertise  take him. he wil make you understand. Qstns on exams are diff from txt book but are the same as what he does in class. attending class is recommended. He's is a little condecending  but whatever right? as long as he explains things well -thats what really matters
4.5,He's really into books. A little eccentric  but a great professor. He's all about the deeper meaning in books so be ready to actually do the reading - cliff and spark notes won't help you in his class. He's a tough grader - especially on essays  but take solace in the fact that he lets you know what he wants so it shouldn't be a surprise.
4.5,Pavlic is a little bit eccentric  but he a real intellectual. He expects as much genuine interest in learning and writing about the material as he puts into teaching it. Which is to say a lot. If students put in the time to read everyhting and pay attention in class  the rewards are worth the effort.
4.5,enthusiastic!!
1,sucks
2.5,A bit confusing
4,He's a pretty tough grader  but he basically tells you what he wants. He takes writing seriously and rates reading even higher than that. If you're an intellectual  he's your kind of professor. If you're lazy and just someonewho's his course cuz you think it'll be easy  don't bother showing up.
4,Incredibly Smart  wayyyyyyyy left wing.. soo disillusioned with the U.S
4,No Comments
5,Brilliant and Beautiful. Keep the blues going!
3.5,One of my favorite profs. Went off on weird tangents but obviously knew and loved the material.
4,she is a great grader. if you hand in a paper shell correct it and hand it back then you fix it and give it to her youll pass. she only uses your top 4 paper and test grades  and gets rid of the other ones.
1,"Does not use canvas  very unorganized  loses papers  does not know what to do  unclear instructions!! No drop boxes  no grades online  doesn't even say our grades when we ask ""you will know by the end of the semester"" is what she says!! Very unfair what if someone is failing! Also does not reply any emails! VERY not recommended! Waste of $ and time"
1,Professor Brown is all over the place. When being assigned essays and such  we were never given a concrete answer of due dates or when an assignment was due. 95% of the time  the class was confused. No note taking  only watching YouTube videos and being tested on handouts. I didn't enjoy this class in the slightest.
5,Definitely take her class for ENG 095. As long as you attend class  do your work and polite to her  she will love you. Papers are only a page long and your final is a group project. Easy A
5,Dr. Brown is one of the most passionate professors I have ever had. She loves modernism and postmodernism and it shows! I learned so much and was able to apply what I learned in other courses. It was a fun  easy class and I would highly recommend taking a course with Dr. Brown.
5,Dr. Brown is one of the best professors I have ever had. This course truly feels like what you might expect for an elective -fun  simple  and engaging. All of the writing comes from your heart (no outside research is necessary). I had her for both Postmodernism and Modernism  but you don't need to take Modernism for Postmodernism. I recommend.
5,SHE IS THE MOST EASIEST TEACHER EVER. Seriously  if you have to take ENG 095  take her. Everything is easy  the papers only have to be a page long  very nice. I absolutely recommend her. She is a bit crazy and most immature people can't tolerate her  but if you want an easy A  here you go.
5,Dr. Sandra Brown is such an exciting professor. I took her for Modernism and will definitely take her for Postmodernism. She has great passion for the material that she teaches. It's a rarity to see these days. I def. recommend her for the Humanities courses. As for grade  it is whatever you want (no tricks). 4 quizzes  4 short papers  very doable.
1.5,She is a good teacher  but not very helpful to the students on a equal level...
3,Dr. Brown is quite an interesting individual and her class was quite disorganized  with the formatting clarifications and changing of rooms. Fortunately  Dr. Brown's humor and execution made up for it and she is one of the sweetest instructors on the OCC campus. I took her Postmodernism  since a class of mine got cancelled  but I hold no regrets.
5,Dr. Brown was an incredible professor  she's a little cray cray but I loved her all the same. She really made class fun  and her crazy comments always made me laugh. Definitely take her  she's awesome.
5,This teacher is the bomb  She is easy  you will just have to do a couple papers  and her tests are also easy. If you try really hard  then u wasted ur time  u can barely try and get a B  or try a little bit and get an A. Shes is so easy to understand  and she isnt boring.. TAKE THIS TEACHER
5,She is the best professor I have had  yet.If you can get her go for it.
5,shes good. pure awesomeness!!!!!
5,No joke  an amazing teacher and really cares about her students! Take her trust all the comments!
4,She is very helpful! The class was easy and so were the tests as long as you paid attention and did your homework you would do fine. take her!
5,Dr. Brown is a fantastic teacher who has a true passion for teaching. She truly cares about her students and is willing to do anything to help them succeed. Her funny and great personality makes class fun and class is never boring. Ever. It's an easy A as long as you do well on your assignments and tests and show up for class.
2.5,Honestly  this lady would be better off teaching middle school English. Work is very childish and not challenging at all. She is a very nice lady  but very disorganized. Assigns a lot of work  but very unclear when it is due. Easy A  but would have actually like to have learned something... anything actually.
5,Awesome professor. Fair  honest and down to earth.
5,Most interesting class with up to date topics. All work was clear  lots of films and group projects . Never boring!
5,Great guy  always willing to help  would love to have him again
5,Prof. Simmonds is the best. He makes class interesting and fun!!!! I got a B from him and I hate English. I would recommend anyone to take him if you don't like English.
1,If you are looking for an easy A. This is the guy wo give it to you  but if you are looking for an actual education take a professor that has a degree in english. Fred Simmonds is a waste of money!!
5,great guy great class
5,great teacher great class great time!!!!!!!
5,He is so easy  funny  and laid back. If you're not into English  I recommend taking him. He's not uptight and has street smarts unlike some professors.
1,get him out!!!
1,this dude is a joke
2,likes controversy...nothing gets done though...great personality but... nothing gets done
5,this teacher is easy as balls. he will give you a C just for signing up. I think i had like 2 assignments the whole semester  and even if you don't do them and you show up  you'll get a B
4.5,No Comments
5,No Comments
2,This guy could care less if u write a thing all u have to do is show up and say a few things and if u don't liek your gread jsut ask hell change it def take him its cake
5,SOOOOOO FUNNY!!! He just wants to have fun and have a lot of debates with him... oh god! haha.. he is the coolest teacher ever i had!
5,He has you discover the chemistry. This has you understand why the rules are the way the rules are and understand why things work the way they do.
1,Dr. Horn has a very unique teaching style. In short he doesn't really teach. Everything you need to know will come from the textbook  the in-class activities will just confuse you and waste your time. His tests are super vague and hardly reflect what was learned. This class does not prepare you for later chemistry courses. Find another teacher.
1,Literally the worst teacher I've ever had! Do not take his class!!!! The average on every test was below a 65 percent. I studied everyday for at least 2 hours. The tests aren't relevant to anything you learn in class. He doesn't teach you anything. I ended up with a 79.82 percent in the class and he wouldn't round up to a B- for me.
1,Literally the worst teacher I've ever had! Do not take his class!!!! The average on every test was below a 65 percent. I studied everyday for at least 2 hours. The tests aren't relevant to anything you learn in class. He doesn't teach you anything. I ended up with a 79.82 percent in the class and he wouldn't round up to a B- for me!
1,"Do not take him! He is more worried about his ""group study"" than the students. The average on the final was 65% and that is considering the curve! I ended up with around 85% on the final  and I ended with a B. The tests are only 15 question each so if you miss 3 your already below 80%. He lectured for a total of a couple hours in the semester."
4,Prof. Horn's class is extremely difficult. Group work every single day. Daily assignments can be confusing at times. Exams are super frustrating and hard. The worst exam set up I've experienced at UVU. He seems super unapproachable in class. That being said  one on one  he is one of the nicest dudes. You can go to him and he will help you out.
3,He is a great teacher  when he teaches! Which is not very often. He knows the subject very well and is passionate about it . However he hardly lectures. The first day of the semester he sticks you in groups and you better hope you get a good group because you will be each others teachers for the semester.
4,There's not much lecturing  mostly group-work  and a lot of self teaching. A lot of people don't like the way it's set up  but I don't mind it. Teaching this way forces students to actually LEARN the material  and it makes the final a lot easier. The class isn't easy  but it's not really supposed to be. Get to know the people in your group!!
1.5,"This is the most frustrating class I have ever taken. He literally does not teach. He gives you ""chemactivities""  and you are supposed to learn from your fellow students. The only plus is you get multiple chances to get the correct answer on tests(it's on a computer). I would not recommend him at all."
3,My advice: Don't skip class  do the homework problems  and ask for help if you need it. Horn goes straight to the tutoring lab every day after class and if you ask for help  he gladly will. Don't underestimate the exams. Try to study with someone else who is in the class. Teaching each other and learning together will help you more than book work.
1,"Don't take chemistry from Horn. He is more concerned about how your are participating in his POGIL project then teaching. Sometimes he answers students questions  hit and miss. Most of time spent working in groups. Very little lecture. Homework solutions are hidden by the professor. Does not teach. ""Engaged learning at UVU""?"
1,"He puts you in a group of 3 and gives you ChemActivities to work on every day. He lectures for 5 min. and then leaves you with your group to figure out how to do chemistry. When I asked him a question he responded ""Look it up in the book"". This is a teach yourself class. Don't expect to learn anything from him. Worst ""teacher"" I've ever had."
4,He is actually funny and very passionate about chemistry. He understands that this class is a lower level chemistry class and doesn't require you to know things above this class. He responds to questions quickly and helped with any problem I had. You are responsible to teach yourself. This class is in no way a breeze go to class and read your book.
4,This class requires alot of self teaching. I liked the class and the group that I was assigned to. YOU MUST GO TO CLASS!! He does in class clicker questions that are graded. He responded to questions very quickly. READ THE BOOK!! Make sure you know your stuff  because its up to you to learn the material. He doesn't lecture in class at all.
3.5,This class has very little lecture  but when he does lecture PAY ATTENTION. Those concepts usually end up on an exam. You work out of a book in groups every class. 3 midterm exams written by him  final is a national exam  mastering chemistry hw each week. Would have gotten a better grade had I put more time into it.
1,Avoid! He's is arrogant. ACS test scores are national. We do terrible on it here at UVU. Take Chem - both semesters - at BYU or the U in the summer. Not with him. Not with him. Not with him.
2.5,My worst experience in this university so far. Absolutely confusing  you go take the test equally prepared every time  and one time you get an A  another a C  then A  then C... random. Infuriating experience  I get 100%s in high math classes and came out discouraged from his class. Avoid at ANY cost.
1,One of the most unhelpful teachers when it comes to teaching. If you like teaching yourself than this is the teacher for you. It isn't very helpful when you and your group have no idea what he is even teaching on. I would say never take it from him.
1,"He thinks he teaches POGIL  but the ""G"" in POGIL method stand for ""Guided"" which he doesn't do. He is lazy. If you go to his office or stay after class to ask him to work out a difficult problem  he doesn't ever do it. If you ask for a way to see the steps  he doesn't give it. When people say he is ""fair"" it's due to his ridiculously huge ""curve."""
1.5,One of the absolute worst professors at UVU. The class is hard and he makes it that much harder. If he is your only option don't take it. He brags about how hard test are. Avg on one test was 55 on a class with over 150 students and he said he was impressed that people had such a high average. Avoid at all costs!
4,I really enjoyed Dr. Richard's class. She has amazing lectures that are based on her life experience and she is hilarious! But beware  don't miss her class or your grade will go down  she takes attendance every day and will notice if you are absent. Be careful and always turn in assignments on syllabus even if she does not ask for them on due date
3,Professor Richard is seen as one of the most difficult teachers. When I took this class I felt like it was hard to focus because we rarely stayed on task. You definitely have to read the books and attendance is mandatory. She grades super hard  but I feel like if you actually try ... your end grade will be acceptable.
1,Do yourself a huge favor & don't choose Richards. She is extremely unorganized in her lectures & rambles about nonsense for the first 25 min of the class  and then expects you to have actually learned something. Class is out of 100 pts  w pop quizzes worth 8  & the final paper (which you put hours and hours into) worth 15... makes no sense. Unfair
1,HORRIBLE. I worked SO hard in this class but richards does not care about that. Got my mid term(a 2 hour essay mid term) grade back THE DAY BEFORE THE FINAL and I recieved a 5. She DOES NOT email students back which is the only way to communicate. None of her assigned videos worked and she would not help fix that problem.
1,Do not take! If you must: play nice  learn 2 names  dates  important events  and basic bio of assigned person. Ignore all assigned reading: exam Q's given one week in advance  plenty to time to prep if you are strong student. Do not skip class but you will want to! Pop quiz  term paper  exams: respond to each sentence of question  be specific!
4,I took her African American history class in USF. Dr. Richards is a great professor. She taught history in Afrocentric perspective. She cares about her students very much. Be aware of the pop quizzes. For midterm and final exams  if you put works on it and do what she asks you to do   you will definitely get a good grades.
1.5,HORRIBLE!! I read reviews about how tough she was  but I chose to ignore them  thinking that they were exaggerating. Her instructions are NOT CLEAR  she expects things to be done  & if not done she gives you a LOW GRADE. Does not give feedback in a timely manner. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS  she doesn't teach. She assigns reading & videos from SFSU lib.
2,Do not take this class if you're looking for an easy A  or if you're looking to work on this class less than 10 hours a day. It's insane  intense  and the hardest class I've ever taken  but also the most interesting and engaging. Only take it if you have time and feel fascinated by the subject. Life changing experience for me  that's for sure.
3.5,Do believe the hype  Dr. Richards is funny  honest and fair. She requires you to buy the book  the questions for the midterm and final come mainly from them. Dont use your phone in class she hates that. She gave the whole class a makeup quiz because we didnt follow her instructions on the midterm. I loved the class and learned alot.
1,DONT DO IT!!! I took this class online for a GE over the summer. HOUR LONG films from the SFSU library EVERY DAY! BORING! NO LECTURE! Every single one of her emails was condescending and rude. Did not do any teaching herself  she just piled on the work and sent rude emails about how students never put in work or effort. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!!!
1.5,"Focuses too much on student ""misbehaviors"". no extra credit  will kick you out of class if you text. Mandatory attendance. Doesn't give students enough motivation to truly succeed and help them. Knows subject material well  but acts far too superior over her students. Very difficult final exam and paper. I'm thankful I was able to pass this class."
1.5,"Would not recommend this teacher. She isn't clear on what she wants in assignments then has the nerve to be offended at students' confusion. Does not cover class readings in lectures. Awful temper and seems to expect the worst out of her students. I quote from her syllabus ""Students usually do not research the proper way to document Internet..."""
4,Don't take this class is you want an easy A or if you do not plan on attending class EVERY class. A lot of the learning comes from the text books & movies. Participation is a MUST! I got a lot out of ARFS 302! Really tough midterm and final you must READ. It was a challenge but if you show up  participate & read you will survive this tough cookie
5,Perspective if you can put your self in out ppl shoes and understand then your essays will be easy. When she assigns you a person she wants to know who what how and the gossip. She wants the juicy stuff. Don't miss class!get the books cuz that can be extra credit  just having em.
4,She is an amazing teacher as long as you're a good student. It's not rocket science  the subjects are not difficult  you just need to actually put effort into it to get a good grade...but isn't that how all college courses should be?
3,You will learn a lot in this class. I enjoyed reading the material and her lectures were very informative. DONT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU WANT AN EASY A BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT GET ONE!! YOU MUST WORK FOR IT!!!
2,Definitely one of the worst teachers I've had here. She repeats herself and talks about herself the whole lecture. The only way you learn is through your own hard work  reading  and the occasional film. Grading compared to content and lectures are very disproportional. Grade rides on 2 tests and 1 essay. Wouldn't do it again.
2,This class was tough. Make sure you read every page of every book-OR ELSE! Attendance is mandatory to stay on top of things or else you will fall behind. She's a tough grader but she is fair. Definitely need a class buddy to study with. Overall  she's a cool teacher  but dont think it will be an easy A- you have to work for it.
3.5,if you wanna learn she will teach you
3.5,Truth and fact - if you take Dr. Richards class - YOU BETTER READ THE BOOK- COMMENT AND TAKE NOTES- DONT COME LATE AND NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER USE YOUR CELL PHONE - over all her lessons are wonderful and her test are challenging - BUT A REAL STUDENT CAN DO IT - just do the work and you will get an A
2,Although this was an easy class  Prof. Pam occasionally went off topic throughout her lectures and was sometimes confusing to follow. You don't have to show up to class  just read the books and complete the essays/ online assignments. Online assignments are credit/no-credit so just try to do them and you'll get the easy points. Last daydonuts so..
5,Funny! Pam Hood loves making jokes to lighten up the learning atmosphere.
4.5,Professor Pam is a riot. She is energetic in her lectures  providing thorough explanations to make an interesting topic much more interesting. I didn't go to class the last two months and still got an A. Easy easy A  you can learn a lot if you push yourself and do the expected work. If you don't  you'll still get an A.
5,One of the coolest professors I've ever seen. PHIL is not my thing but I took her PHIL101 for GE purposes. Her class does NOT have any exam including final. There are about 3-4 essays that are fairly easy. They have deadlines but u can turn in anytime u want without getting any penalty. She grades not hard too. 100% recommend to her class.
3,You dont even need to come to class. I only came sometimes for the comfy seats. There is no late policy for any of her work. She doesnt believe in midterms or finals exams so thats a plus! Very easy if you put in some effort in her essays.
4.5,Pretty chill teacher. No late policy so just turn in assignments by last day of semester and you are set. As for attendance - leeeel whats that. only went 5 times Difficulty of class: easy. For 2 creative projects2 agora days - just turn in and free 100% For 3 short essays - actually put some effort into it and you're good.
4,"Pretty easy class as long as you actually put some thought into the essays and reports. EXTREMELY nice and helpful professor. Attendance is not ""mandatory"" however she did take attendance daily. Lectures could be pretty boring  but they're helpful when you don't understand the material. All the lectures consisted of her explaining the reading."
2,SWEEET LADY that loves her In-N-Out! I'm not into philosophy.....and this class made me not want to take interest in philosophy even more. Class was boring and i didn't attend 80% of the time  except on test days. Passed with an A because i actually did a bit of reading for the tests and i took the assignments seriously!
3.5,Professor Hood LOVES her In-N-Out! Throughout the semester  she used burgers and donuts and used them to make philosophical arguments  which was pretty hilarious!! Though her lectures DRAGGED on and were most of the time boring  i still learned some interesting stuff when i read the book and wrote the essays. Do your best on the tests and papers!
5,Easy class  readings are sometimes confusing  but just do your best. Email her for any concerns or questions  she is approachable. Overall  do your best and it should be a chill class
4.5,Easy class  if you're looking to boost your gpa then take her class. It consisted of 4 tests which are pretty straight forward. Questions are always welcomed and answered in a clear way. Great class overall  the key to doing well is to not over-think things.
5,Forget what the other bad reviews told you  I just took her (Fall 2013) and she is really chill and funny. If you take this class you will pass as long as you don't skip a lot of classes.
5,Professor pam is the best! Super chill and easy class! She's really nice! There are no midterms or finals! We did three essays and all the other work was just complete or incomplete. I definitely recommend this class for everyone! She lets us out early half the time! Seriously best class ever!
5,This class is ridiculously easy. She goes over the readings in class so you don't really have to read. All hw  quiz dates  and essays are listed on the syllabus. She doesn't take attendance but showing up to class is the easiest way to pass. The tests are easy too -- she allows you to make them up weeks after the initial date. Everything is easy.
3.5,She's very understanding and wants her class to pass. She explains what is being read and discusses the chapters for a better understanding.
4.5,Professor Pam was super sweet and always really entertaining. She kept us interested and was really relatable. Her papers were not difficult as long as you did (some of) the required readings. Plus  she brought our class 3 dozen doughnuts on our last day of class! NO FINALS IN THIS CLASS. I would take another class with her  for sure.
4,Like most courses and professors  you will only get as much out of this as you intend to. If you really need help  you need to ask and help will be given etc. Regarding personality Professor Hood is quirky and keeps things fresh  to say the least. Drive and interest are key motivators to understand and do well because the material can be dense.
2,DO NOT TAKE HER. I took her because of the easy reviews however Spring 2012 she took off suddenly to medical leave. She misses class a lot so the school took action. We got this new guy for a teacher who made the class quite difficult. Quizzes were more challenging as were the lengths of the essays. A lot of the class did poorly on quizzes.
1,She cancelled class frequently  but ended up giving all of her students A's. It was a bit scary to not have ANY idea what my grade looked like until the end of the semester  but there was hardly any work in the class.
2,"Spring '10. Incredibly easy. Lots of Cancels. Skimmed the reading. Lecture was dry  even when she tries to make it relatable with college kids. In fact  it gets near incomprehensible when she starts throwing in lingo that she perceives as ""current."" But what can you do when half the class looks like they don't even know how to write a decent paper."
5,Great presenter and allows students to get involved. One of my favorite classes in my undergrad yet!
2.5,for a 2000 level class  this was brutal. His powerpoints are just endless slides of paragraphs that make no freaking sense. The exams are all essays or terms  which he doesn't even list off  so you basically have rummage through all of the slides and GUESS what may or may not be on the exam. Worst class I've ever taken. Harvey's a nice guy tho
3,The entire class is based on the midterm and the final exam. You don't really have to do the readings until you're studying  and theres no textbook so thats a bonus. Study hard for the exams and you'll do fine. He is incredibly intelligent. Don't take this class if you're looking for an easy mark!
3,Dr. Harvey is a brilliant professor and a compassionate one towards students. The first professor I had that actually took time and effort to find online resources and material  which was grade A quality  for the course instead of getting us to spend $$$ on textbooks. Lecture slides are posted  exams are heavy on material but can be done with study
4,Harvey isn't arrogant- he is just extremely intelligent. World Politics is not a light subject and he expects that people are intelligent enough to see both sides of arguments. Loved his class- he was super helpful when I emailed him a question and I believe my exams were marked very fairly (the final was difficult)
3.5,Dr. Harvey was a fantastic professor
2,He knows what he is talking about. He is a very nice man. He didn't organize world politics very well though. It was always unclear what we were supposed to have read for class  and he assigned a ridiculous amout of reading. It was mostly redundant  and he did not elaborate on the subtleties between readings in class. Pointless readings.
4,Very intense and opinionated.
3,Proff Harvey is knowledgeable in this subject but has trouble relaying that information without reading his slides word by word. He does not post the slides until just before the exam. There are two exams. That's it and they are difficult. You really  really  really need to study. You cannot slide by in this class. Be prepared.
2,If you think World Politics are interesting  this class will teach you otherwise. Hard to stay focused when you're read 50 slides word for word with little to no discussion. Seems like he'd rather be elsewhere. It's a shame because you can tell he's a nice guy. The marking is unfair - a midterm and final. You can't gauge understanding on two tests.
2,Don't have to go to class all the time. Although the marks are entirely exam based which kind of sucks. He seemed like he'd rather be somewhere else than teaching students. Helpful and open to criticism
3.5,Ah  he was a nice guy who is definitely passionate about the subject. Approachable. Content was challenging  which didn't mix that great with the marking system (40% midterm  60% exam)  but I walk away liking it. You know  he even said thanks once when I held the door open for him  which is more than I can say about other profs :P.
2.5,Clearly would rather be doing his own research than condescending to teach. Very opinionated  and not tolerant of other opinions. Assigns his own articles for readings. Lectures are deadly boring. Does decent prep before midterm / final  but the TAs marked pretty tough.
5,Great guy. Brilliant  too. Easy to approach and good insight (a genuine care for students). Make sure you do the required readings - he'll want you to name names and events. It's more than just theory at this stage. Work hard and get a good mark - you'll be satisfied.
4.5,A passionate prof. I could see how lectures could be dry if you were on fb the entire time instead of listening... listen! He has stuff to say. He wants to know whether or not the class agrees with his lectures--he's open to controversy. Same with his exams. If you work hard you will be satisfied with Harvey.
2.5,This class would be absolutely fantastic if it was smaller. 200+ people in a class with an overwhelming amount of theories and case studies doesn't accomplish much. I feel like I came out a bit empty-handed. Watch out for his exams  they definitely overcompensate for lack of any class/homework all year...
3,Really nice guy who wants to be helpful and engaging - but isn't always successful. It was massive class  he crammed way too much information  with no tutorials or assignments to help you along halfway. The grade is split between the midterm and final exams. Overall  a frustrating class  disappointing considering the topics are very interesting
3.5,You can tell he is a really nice guy and very passionate about what he teaches. His lectures can be dull  but he is extremely accomplished in his field so it is overall a pretty good class despite the difficult subject matter.
2.5,WORST CLASS EVER  Stay far away from Harvey's World poly Sci class. His lectures DO NOT HELP YOU AT ALL  He has The worst reader EVER MADE (it is soooo borning and will costs alot of $$) If you like BORNING profs who make you read BORING EXPENSIVE READERS inorder to even pass the class HARVEY IS YOUR MAN! STAY FAR AWAY FROM HARVY AND THIS CLASS!!!!
3.5,He was an interesting prof. I loved his lectures but if you didn't keep up with the reading you were in trouble. The marking wasn't very fair because it was in such big chunks but he was still one of my fav profs this past semester- even though I got one of my worst marks in his class! And he also brought in the most amazing guest speakers :)
5,CSUSB: ECTS Program: Online class  no tests or quizzes  follow directions  turn in all assignments  participate in peer feedback  and earn this easy A.
5,Nice  experienced professor  always available for help  either in email  phone or in person. Great feedback on assignments  I would recommend him.
5,No Comments
4,His class was so easy I passed with and A+. he even asked me to be his student helper!!! He was funny and a good teacher I would recommend him as a teacher
4,He is a good teacher and the class is very easy. If you know anything about cars this class will be a breeze. Its cool that you get to use all the tools and lifts to work on your own car. Pay attention and you will be fine.
5,Dr. Glanville is the best. The complaints listed here make sense only if you are not interested in doing philosophy in a rigorous and fulfilling way. If you have a chance to take him  do it!
1.5,I got an A. It was so easy I wanted to die. Don't take this guy.
3,Incredibly erudite. He has profound amount of knowledge in his head. But he was too slow in lecturing  and kinda old. He used wolfgang Behm as an assistant. i talked w/ him after class alot. That guy knows his Plato and medieval philosophy like nobodys business and really helped cement what Glanville was saying. get Wolfgang  not Glanville.
1,Ignore recommendations. If you take him  be sure you can drop the class  you'll want to. He is an extremely intelligent man  but we never once covered more than the first item on the board (interesting  but not acceptable). He is so quiet you can barely hear him. This man should teach privately  he just does not fit in the academic environment.
1,i feel sorry for the man  but i mean COME ON! its time to retire because the entire class can't understand what you're saying...gradings not too hard. easy reading. boring as hell teacher :/
2,He is a brilliant. There is an amazing amount of information in this man's head. However  he is nit-picky about stupid things. We read the Bible the entire semester. But it was an easy A.
1,Awful. Just awful.
1,this guy shouldn't be a teacher anymore.
1.5,Be advised  he will yell at you for shaking your leg  for looking out a window  for chewing gum  almost anything. He's very old and has seriously lost it. DO NOT TAKE.
1,Hard to understand  very old and cantankerous. I even like boring philosophy by most people's standards. Very arbitrary and could hardly put together sentences at times. Avoid at all costs.
1.5,No Comments
5,very straightforward professor. Keeps you interested with the history of Greek philosophy. Requires only a short midterm and a short final. Show respect and he'll respect you.
3.5,too critical of others' habits and  at times  a bit despotic  but overall he is an excellent professor.
5,this guy is soo blunt that if you are wrong he will tear you up. He is a great teach and make sure you are on time or else you will get a 5th grade scolding.
4.5,I cannot respect anyone who doesn't like Glanville. He is one of the best professors I have ever had. He is thorough  clear  knowledgable  fair  demanding. If you are a serious student who enjoys rigorous learning (and not some whiney idiot who wants to be pandered to) you will love this professor.
5,This guys is so passionate about Ancient Philosphy that he wishes he lived in Ancient Greece. Make sure you come to class on time or he will get angry. All you have to do in that class is pay attention take notes and do 3 take home tests.
1,This teacher is so boring!!! It sucks that I had to take him as a night class teacher. ALL he does is repeat himself and read from the book. SOOOOO boring
5,If you are a philo major you should take him -he has it down like a math equation- especially Greeks thoug somewhat westernized greeks- and lets be fair what do u expect from an old guy- talk to him in person and you will learn much more after all he is almost a retired prof.
1,I just could not keep from falling asleep. Extremely dull. He does harldy anything but read from the book.
4.5,I can see how a disengaged student filling requirements might be bored... critical thinking can't be terribly exciting to teach to bored/boring students  either. If you are interested in philosophy and want to study with a deep  imaginative  and methodical professor  he's your man.
5,I love this professor  she is passionate about the subject and tries her best to get you interested as well  tests are easy  quizes everyweek but you can use your notes  there is alot of homework but they count alot for your grade. Take her  you wont regret it  she's the sweetest prof at chaffey.
5,A great teacher and I recommend this teacher for anyone who is going to take astronomy.
5,One of the easiest classes i have ever taken. I don't know how anyone ended up with less than an A in this class  really. Do all the work and show up to class and you get an A. Study for exams  they are very easy too. She is super smart and a Harvard alumni  even though she never mentioned it because she is super humble. Amazing professor.
5,Eisberg is AMAZING. Very enthusiastic and easy going professor and is always available to help. She tends to ramble though  she'll spend 20 minutes answering a yes or no question but I'd take her again. As long as you go to class and do the homework and online quizzes you'll pass and there's a few extra credit opportunities.
4,Professor Eisberg is a great professor. She's super enthusiastic about astronomy and very helpful. There is homework pretty much every week  you should be prepared to dedicate a few hours to that (basically twice the length of the online lecture). Lots of assignments  but they're easy and are all completed in class.
3,I took her for a fast-track class  it was worth it  but expect to put in work for your grade. She makes you do powerpoints at home and then the next day in class she re-lectures you on what you learned last night and its very boring. You need to show up to class because right after lectures you do a lab or learn an astronomical equation for tests.
4,Eisberg is awesome. Hardest class I've taken but so incredibly worth it. She is passionate about what she teaches. She is there for assistance if you need it. She wants to help the students. I loved the content. I would totally recommend her!
3.5,Joann is great. She really wants all her students to succeed and is always available to help you out if you have any questions. She taught a flipped instruction course which required a lot of studyingonline lectures for homework  but her lectures class activities always make the material easy to understand. Love her!
4,LOTS OF PHYSICS INVOLVED!!! I'm not a mathematical genius so this class and the test's were slightly confusing at times. Overall a good class though  I really received the help I needed when I needed it. I would recommend her .
4.5,She is a wonderful person and I love her enthusiasm/passion. Super sweet and willing to help you in any way. The class was fairly easy. My only problem with her is that she is easily distracted and loves to ramble on. She will spend half of the class talking about something completely unrelated to what we are supposed to be learning.
5,Very passionate about Astronomy. If you have a question  she will answer it in a way that is fun  and easy to understand. 5 large homework assignments that she will guide you on how to do it. A lot of calculations but it is gone over a lot before you do it on your own. Easy exams  lots of extra credit opportunities.
5,Joann is awesome! hilarious  quirky  and passionate. I would say this: there is A LOT of material covered but she only tests you on a quarter of it. follow the notes provided in the syllabus and you'll be golden on hw and tests. Also  if you're lazy or too special ed to do fractions then skip this class and take earth science or something.
3,I definitely agree about her voice! It was like nails on chalkboard to me. She's a nice lady but you can tell she lives&breathes astronomy so much that her social skills took a back seat! She would ramble on and on about the easiest topic leaving us to figure out the harder stuff ourselves. She nit-picks to the smallest detail on the homework.
3,I have mixed feelings about this class  not so much the professor. Eisberg is good. Nice lady  helpful. I am not a science person so I thought this would be a better option then bio or chem but this class was still difficult. 5 big hw assignments  tests are short but worth a lot of points and in depth. Professor good
5,i took this class because i was looking for an easy A and it was all that was left to enroll in.But the class work is difficult but if you ask for help she does and makes it so darn easy once she does.And even gave me a interest in the planets that im always staring in the sky saying oh this is what she was talking about.i liked her
2.5,Oh man. I don't know how she got such good ratings. Her voice makes you want to... hurt... things. every seen mrs. doubtfire? she's like a mix of that and julia child. makes it hard to focus and i think she does it on purpose! i don't mean to be hateful... but you need the facts. don't take her. definitely. I even got a B and i'm sayin this!
4,Sweet lady. Very positive. Loves astronomy! Moderately difficult course  but simple if you just show up and keep up with assignments.
5,just an amazing professor. LOVES her work and is very passionate about the history of our universe and will help in and out of class until you understand. she explains the material througouly  makes it fun for everyone  and will not give you a day without making you smile.
5,Professor Eisberg is OBVIOUSLY in love with astronomy & is very passionate about teaching it  she loves sharing her knowledge. She is very quirky & keeps things interesting even though we had a 2hr 50min class it was NEVER a drag to go! This was a great lab class! I would HIGHLY recommend it!! :)
5,Professor Eisberg is a great professor. She's sweet  nice  and a little quirky. She's genuinly interested in astronomy  which got me interested in it. If you need a class with a lab this is a great one to take.
5,Really enjoyed her online class. You know what is expected of you each week and you have opportunities to work ahead. The course material was very interesting and overall I am glad I got her as a professor.
4,Easy A. So easy I didn't learn much. Participate and get an A.
5,Maria was the sweetest professor I have ever had. She was super flexible and understands that life happens sometimes. Sometimes was not super clear about criteria. But was fairly assessable outside of the classroom. Absolutely adored her and wished I wasn't done with my psych requirements to take more classes with her ! I took her at the RCC Campus
5,she's great. wants you to succeed. will help you if you ask for extra credit. very good lectures and good study guides. I've followed her for my bio major prereqs. she likes you to be involved in discussion on the topics on the subjects of the day. love the team group testing gives the chance to build up grade. She's best teach ever for psych.
5,Great professor! Must rent textbook to receive participation points on the online discussions b/c participation grade weighs a lot. She likes to know you are reading the assignments and quoting from the actual book. She does offer extra credit via essay. Only need to write 2 essays for online class APA style. Great at replying back to emails
5,Took this class online and it was an easy A. If anyone isn't a Psych major and wishes to just knock this class out of the way i would recommend taking online. It saved me alot of time. All you need to do is reply to these forums once a week and you had 3 papers due throughout the whole semester and they were easy! She responds fast to emails.
3,I love mrs Fitzpatrick psych 25. She's very caring a bit of a calling in sick but if you voice your concerns to her she will help you pick up grade. She's funny. her tests do match her 3 exams. a lot of reading. she lets you use a cheat sheet on test easy A. very accessible on line and in office. she's overall very relaxed happy all the time.
1,"Grades papers kind of hard. Lots of group work. Such a big class & the students screwed around so much that you could never hear the lecture. At some point  you need to tell the class to quiet down. Some of us were actually there to learn. She was often in her own little world. Doesn't really seem to care about what she ""teaches."""
1,Fitzpatrick is a total valley girl that sounds like she has a 3rd grade education. Class was really boring. Watched old movies from the 70's/80's that didn't teach us anything. Had to write several papers. She's a stickler for APA format. She's overrated if you ask me.
1,Too many papers. Doesn't respond to emails. Often late to class. Not sure I even learned anything.
1,"Very annoying/needy. Part of our grade is visiting her during her office hours. She said that if we don't have any ?'s that we still needed to show up to say Hi. She also ""let"" the class decide when papers will be due after giving suggested dates. After an hour of everyone arguing  we ended up w/same dates as orig. More papers than English class."
1,"Most lectures are half lecture half movie  not very specific on what you need to be paying attention to. Beware  she will not reply back to your emails. Feedback for our research paper rough draft was given back to us 3 days before the final draft was due. She makes you take all the tests twice for a ""chance"" to do better but  its not worth it. :("
4,Several small papers required and a final 5 page APA style research paper. Her exams cover a lot of material but she works with you to get a better grade.
5,If you're trying to just finish your GE Classes & get easy A I would def take Professor Fitzpatrick  but if you actually want to learn psychology i would prob take someone else. Anyways  I took this course online and it was super easy  saved me lots of time. quizzes are untimed and you just have to keep up with the weekly forums . Shes so awesome!!
2,She took over the 2nd half of my socialpsych class. I had her for intro to psych and it was a waste of time. Her classes are why millenials think they're owed something. Write all your answers on her allowed cheat sheets and do assignments and you get an A+. If felt like an insult to the students who actually want to be challenged and EARN grades.
2,her lecture is really boring  she use a lot of boring video  long long time ago information. she offer a lot extra credit  if you did them you will get a good grade. it is hard to learning something through her lecture.
5,Her online Psych 25 class was the easiest class I've ever taken! Her quizzes aren't timed and you have all semester for homework assignments. Definitely recommend this class if you are working full time and don't really have time for homework.
5,Professor Fitzpatrick is awesome and really pretty. She really knows her stuff for all of her psych classes. She emails fast and answers all of your questions. I definitely recommend taking her for all of your psych classes.
5,One of the best classes I've taken. I took this class online over the summer. There are weekly forum posts and quizzes. One final and two papers. She is easy to talk to and is always willing to help. There was a lot of reading  but it was easy reading cause it is all very interesting. Take her! You won't regret it.
5,She's a great professor and her class is interesting. She offers a cheat sheet for every exam only because her tests are pretty difficult. She is a fair grader  however  she takes APA format very serious. If you make any mistakes on an APA format assignment  she will take many points off. Other than that  she's very clear. Offers extra credit.
1.5,This teacher definitely chooses her favorites but seems to pick on those who stand out in either good or bad ways. She enjoys being the one who knows more so don't challenge her! Just keep your head down and your mouth closed and you'll do fine!
5,Took Ms. Maleki for CNA. She's tough. If you want to be a nurse take anyone but if you want to An EXCELLENT nurse  take her. She does pick favorites and will snap on you. Just blend in and don't stand out and just learn what she has to pass on to you.
4,She is strict but she will help you if you ask. She always has help material in her office if you are struggling with a topic. She is willing to do what she can to help her students. She tends to use other resources that are not required text but it is to benefit the students learning. She has high expectations both of her teaching and her student.
1.5,Be careful..she has her favorites & not-so-favorites...moody..tests are unfair. If she makes a grading error on your exam you must challenge it in writing!! Even though it was her mistake! Stay away from her at all costs!
1,This teacher has high expectations of students but moreover has to be right all of the time. Careful what you say regarding disagreeing as it will bite you in the end. Try not to stand out. She likes to be the one who shines. She is very calucating.
1,unfair standards
3,not recommended her at all. so strict teacher
5,STUDY!!!! STUDY!!!! STUDY!!!!! She expects you to know EVERYTHING!!!!!!!! Mrs. Maleki is GREAT!!!! I would 100 % take her over again if she taught another class. She makes you learn and understand. She's funny and down to earth. She'll write you up even if she likes you. She treats everyone the SAME when grading and while in clinical. 100% GREAT !
1,This professor definatly shows favoritism blatently. If you do not agree with her  may I suggest you bite your tongue. She will earmark you for failure and never let you live it down. She is very scattered in her lectures and pulls test questions out of thin air. Then she marks answers wrong on the test when the book says the answer is correct.
5,No Comments
5,MRS. MALEKI IS A VERY NICE LADY. SHE IS STRICT  BUT SHE WILL DO WHAT SHE CAN TO HELP YOU. SHE JUST TOOK OVER AS BEING THE DIRECTOR OF THE VN PROGRAM  AND WHEN SHE DID  SHE TOTALLY TURNED IT AROUND FOR THE BETTER. I AM VERY GREATFUL  THANK YOU MRS. MALEKI
5,Great teacher... Kindda strict  but very helpful. I recomend taking her classes!
4.5,Very knowledgable and caring.
5,great and fun to learn with!
5,HE IS SO FUN. I LOVED HIM. GREAT TEACHER. HE TEACHES IN THE VN PROGRAM AS WELL AS THE ADN PROGRAM.
1,Talk  talk  talk. But chili pepers and eye candy.
4.5,WHOA HE TALKS A LOT!!!! Watch out people. Get lots of daydreams ready cause he will TALK YOUR FRIGGIN' EAR OFF!
5,No Comments
5,MRS SEOL WAS MY FAVORATE INSTRUCTOR IN THE VN PROGRAM. SHE TEACHES BOTH LECTURE AND CLINICAL! HER TESTS ARE DIFFICULT BUT THEY ARE IN LINE WITH HER LECTURES! SHE IS VERY ENCOURAGING! I LOVED HER AND WOULD RECOMMEND HER TO ANYONE! THANK YOU MRS. SEOL
5,Dr Tjandra is a very smart professor   he definatley provides you the recourses to well in his class. Practice the hw problems as many times as possible and focus on the material he emphasizes in lecture. Dont fall behind because it will punch you in the face the deeper you get into the course. He drops lowest test and has weekly quizzes.
4,Professor Tjandra was great! He explains everything thoroughly and in an easy way to try to remember. It is a lot of work  includes homework assignments  exercise worksheets  quizzes  tests  and lab work. I however did not put my full effort so i will probably be failing the class but will retake him soon after because he really is great.
5,I had absolutely no chemistry background but professor Tjandra gives really good examples so the material is understandable. There is a lot of work for this class but it's good practice for the test.
5,Professor Tjandra is amazing! I never thought I would be so intrigued by Chemistry. He really had me enjoy coming to class  which is a first. He definitely wants to make sure you understand everything and uses great examples. Take him!!
5,If your going to take chemistry you have to take Tjandra!! He prepares you for everything! It is very clear he wants you to pass! Take him  you won't be disappointed..
4,He was the first science professor I had at Chaffey college. He was amazing. I had never taken chemistry previously and I passed his class with an A. He gives lots of hand outs that really help with understanding and does a lot of in class activities. I would recommend him. I wish he tought 24A and 24B
4,Great lectures  very friendly and ready to help. As said below if your study your homework and notes well then you'll do well on his tests. He gives out exercise worksheets to make sure you know the math parts of chem.
5,Excellent professor. Makes chemistry very simple to understand. Can't say more  just an AWESOME professor! (Textbook is only used for homework.)
4.5,Dr. Tjandra is the best chemistry professor I have ever taken. His lectures are very good. He uses a combination of powerpoint and boardwork to explain his topics and he does this very well. His tests are tough and the lab reports are long so make sure that you are studying and have the time set apart for this class. Super time-consuming.
5,I loved this Professor. His way of teaching (his notes) are very helpful.. would take him again.. especially if you've taken other professor for same class  you'll see the difference. Passed his class with a B+ without any tutoringgroup studyingreading book. So if you try a little more then I did i'm sure you'll get an A+. you'll do just fine!!!
5,If you plan on going further into chemistry  definitely take Tjandra. Best chem teacher ever. Class is easy because he is determined to help you understand  however even intro to chem gets a little complicated so listen to the man and do your work.
5,wonderful  wonderful  wonderful! I never took chemistry before  and was rather afraid because i was unfamiliar with it. he made it so fun and understandable  and was always there to help. he also offers a great amount of extra credit  but he give you challenge also and makes sure you know the subject.. love this professor!!!
5,Tjandra is really helpful to his student! Loved his class! I have a REALLY hard time with chemistry  but Mr. Tjandra made it so understanding and easy. Its not hard to pass his class IF you do all the hw and exercises he gives you. Also you NEED to study. overall his class is the best. Wish all science teachers were like him.
5,he is such a sweetheart! ha ha. he really wants to help you guys succeed  you can tell by his actions. it is kind of adorable how he tries to tie in science jokes in class to ease everyone up and try to make things fun. take it easy  study frequently  and do you homework!!!! if you miss those you will lose valuable points! good luck
5,I had Dr. Tjandra for Chem 21  22  75A  and 75B. He is the best professor I've had  ever. He genuinely cares for his students and their success. Chemistry is a tough subject but he really tries and makes it understandable to his students. Do your homework carefully  take careful notes  and go to his office hours and you'll do fine. He's the best!
4.5,DR. TJANDRA IS AMAZING. HE IS SO HELPFUL AND REALLY WANTS THE STUDENTS TO SUCCEED. HE CARES ABOUT WHAT HE DOES AND FURTHERMORE HE IS SUPER INTELLIGENT!! HE REALLY GOES THE EXTRA MILE FOR HIS STUDENTS. EXCELLENT CHOICE
4.5,Tjandra is an amazing teacher! Before taking his class I was so intimidated with Chemistry. Tjandra really knows how to teach and offers as much help as you need to help you understand. Don't miss a class or hw and you will do well. Memorize everything he says to in the beginning and towards the end everything will just fall into place.
5,Love love love this class! Once you understand all the elements  the class is so easy. Loved how Dr tjandra reached. He is really helpful :) I would highly recommend this class!
5,took Dr. Tjandra for chem 21  22  75a  ans plan on taking him again to 75b. Hes a great professor he gives good examples and makes it easy to understand chemistry. quiz's are straight from the hw  exams are pretty difficult but you will do good if you study the hw and class notes  finals not bad though  lab is just lab pretty easy if you read ahead
4.5,He is great! He gives plenty of examples and really wants you to succeed. Just go to all the lectures and keep up with hw and you won't be surprised on the tests. I wish he taught more classed because he's probably the best prof I've had at chaffey. He has an accent but easy to understand. Overall  take him!
1,The modules due each week take at least an hour or more to complete  we have online group work in which she expected us to email each other our work back and forth  there is a 9-11 page term paper at the end which is essentially your final  and oh yeah she wrote the book so if you don't word for word repeat the book  your answer wrong.
2,DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS! I took this as my writing intensive course and was that a mistake. The online site was impossible to navigate  the tests are timed (an hour and a half) and had I not had someone send me the questions beforehand it would be impossible for me to finish them in time  it took me four hours to answer all the OR questions. CONT..
4,Lots of reading followed by class discussion over material. You know ahead of time exactly what is expected for assignments. So if you want to actually learn and participate in class do the reading. If not do the readings when the assigned papers are due. With the least bit of effort you can get a great grade. She is lecture heavy.
3,Need to show up to class. She gives random participation days and takes attendance every day. Reports are easy as long as you skim the material.
5,I absolutely loved this class. I showed up for every class session. You have to unless you have a friend who is willing to give you the notes since she does not post powerpoints online. She goes in depth and you actually learn the subject matter. The tests are literally based on the notes and questions from the study guide. Overall  she is great!
3,She seemed a little nutty at times but she's super caring and sweet. I didn't pay attention in her class and still managed to get an A.
4.5,I loved Mrs. Newhart. 130S was a part Philosophy  part service learning class focused on teaching children philosophy but it was incredibly easy. I read none of the material but showed up & passed with an easy A. Some failed the first test  so the rest were take home essays. I wasn't interested in the material but I would recommend this class.
3,Super sweet lady but be prepared! Her slides are not posted on blackboard  nothing is  and the slides are really the entire book put on power point. If pressured for time. She gives a study guide for the exams but its just as long as her power points. She is very mum on what to expect for exams. I feel Im going in to it exams blind.
4,Dr. Newhart is kind of spacey  but she is a very helpful professor. This class requires a lot of work  but she is nice and very friendly.
4,Difficult subject but I somehow managed to get an A. She is nice but gets mad if you talk in class. She will help you any way she can. Attendance is only mandatory in that if you don't show up you won't have a clue what is going on. The textbook is very helpful. The only assignments are 5 exams and 1 term paper.
4.5,I really like Professor Newhart. She does talk quite a bit but overall I really liked her class. I have never taken a philosophy class so some of the material was hard to understand. You do have to write a lot in class and she always gives you good feedback on your papers. I liked her!
1.5,Took course with Newhart and only passed by two points while learning nothing. Re-took course with Parchment and ACED it while learning alot. Newhart: TONS of homework
1.5,she talks to fast. she doesnt help. her class is boring as heck and i just dislike her class in general. the material is not very hard but the way she teaches it the book is all that you are using to learn from
2.5,Newhart is not my favorite professor... It may be because I don't quite enjoy Aristotle and Plato
4,She was a very good teacher and super nice. Didn't have presentations or tests. You had to write papers  but they were all very easy to write.
3.5,Dr. Newhart is a wonderful lady but this course is a bore. There's a lot of busy work and class can get boring very fast. She is a sweet lady though  and sometimes can be fun. She laughs about everything...There's a lot of class participation but none of the material is that hard to grasp if you do the homework (or at least some of it).
3,I am not a fan of Dr Newhart at all. As interested as she is in philosophy  and as knowlegeable as she is about the subject  she does not know how to express it to her students without giggling a lot at her own jokes. I have to take notes hardcore when she teaches because her lectures do not sink in at all.
3,Newhart is crazy. The only woman I know that can say um and ya know forty seven time straight. Class is boring but a breeze
5,"Dr. Newhart is a ""hoot""! She makes class so interesting. Helps you learn in many aspects so a tricky subject is very understandable. Very easy grading on all work and will tell you where you need to improve. Easy to talk to  very understanding lady. Plenty of energy but fun."
3,easy class as long as you dont mind to write about 11 1-2 page papers and 2 big papers. no tests or homework other than the papers. shes def out there though dont count on learning anything in class shes in her own world
5,Priverida has strong teaching skills  but she is a hard grader---not bad to look at either.
4.5,Really good teacher  provides many different points of view and life experience examples when possible. Always cheerful! I wish more professors were like her. Tests are pretty easy if you read and do the study guide. I would recommend Dr.Prividera to any one majoring in Communication.
1,she is ok as teacher nothing great. i did hate dgoing to class because she is fake. you can tell by the tone of her voice when she speaks its a put on. she also needs to realize that comm is a required course and not everyones major  so comm is not my life. chem is a little more important tan comm to some people.
5,She is a really great teacher and is one of the few profs i have had thats relates to students well. She is very understanding and will give you test questions on a regular basis if you go to class. I would strongly suggest her. She does a good job at making class interesting and making the material understandable.
3,I can go ahead and say she is a very good teacher BUT for the gender comm class I would not recommend taking her. She is so pro women it makes taking her class as a male akward and disheartend. one would think a class on gender bias wouldnt be so centered on making everyone think the world is out to get women. the text book is awful.
2.5,It would be nice if she stopped talking about her self and teach for a little while. How many times do we have to hear about how many awards she has won?
5,I've had a lot of professors but I can confidently say that Dr. Prividera is one of the most exceptional instructors I've ever known. You will learn  you will not be bored  you will look forward to class  and you will get the grade you deserve. If they were all like her you'd never want to graduate.
4.5,She is amazing! If you come to class and take the notes the three tests will not be a problem! She does a great job of making this class interesting  she seems very passionate about what she teaches which is a huge plus. You don't wanna listen to professor who doesn't care about what they teach right???
4.5,Dr. Priv is good. She is very outgoing  a little loud sometimes  but she is a fun teacher. She tries to learn your name even though it's a huge class which by the way makes people a little more shy than usual.
5,Dr. Prividera is my absolute favorite professor here! I'm even smiling as I type this! She's so helpful. Attendance is a must because she doesn't place the powerpoints online. Take tedious notes and study everything and you're good! Ask questions about the study guides if unclear-- it pays off later.
5,Professor Prividera is a fantastic teacher! She answers all your questions before you ever ask...she's very thorough! The class was very interesting & the topics discussed were easy to relate to! There are 3 exams which are straight from the notes  & she gives lots of examples to help you understand! Pay attention & study & you're sure to get an A!
4,Great Teacher. Really knows her stuff. Very energetic and seems genuinely happy to be teaching communication. If you go to class and take notes the exams should be no problem and she sends out studying guides. She gives you chances to ask questions and talk to her about things you dont understand. I definately recommend her.
5,Great teacher. Very energetic. She only has 3 tests  but she's good. If you come to class and pay attention and take notes  you'll be fine :)
5,Best teacher i've ever had in my life...Excellent energy and its not a difficult class...HIGHLY recommend--seriously-- she's a great professor
5,Excellent professor and if u come to class you will do fine!
5,No Comments
4,I like this class and the open forum.
3,I did not care for her and I feel that she did not care for me or my ideas. Some people like her  but I bet she liked them as well. I never did anything to her to deserve a C in her esy class. I turned in everything and I was nearly always there for class. Just don't wast your time.
5,Awesome teacher! Definitely one of my favorite teachers in the comm department. Very interesting class  the discussions are great! Dr. Privedera is very intelligent. Tests aren't easy  but she gives you a study guide. Definitely take this class with her!
5,Fun class. She has a lot of energy and a lot to say. She is very intellegent and enjoys talking to students. I interviewed her for a project in another class and she spend several hours chatting with me about her feminist views  which really helped me out and had nothing to do with her own class.
1.5,Very confusing man  doesn't seem familiar with the topics or how to explain them. Overall  not a great instructor for electrotech
4.5,No Comments
3,Haha  Best Name Ever.r r Fun course and good prof too  I guess.
3.5,good and hot prof  nice guy from stanford!
5,He is really nice prof. He is really helpful all the time. He is cool!
4,Professor Spears is not the easiest marker and I will not be receiving an extremely high mark in his class  but he is caring  passionate and insightful. He loves the material he teaches and loves to discuss it. The Essay was super fun to write. The class needs a lot of time devoted to readings though. Overall  would take again.
5,Prof. Spears is by far the BEST professor/instructor/teacher I have had in my entire University experience. He was always so excited to start the lecture and actually cares about what he is teaching students. I've taken two classes with him already and plan on taking any more that I can in my last year. Highly recommend taking any class he teaches
5,Hilarious that people complain about the amount of readings in 4340. It's a FULL credit course. What did u expect? Gives away 20% of ur mark in weekly quizzes/participation. Much less writing than other full credits(3 essays  18 pages total). Tough marker for essays  but fair & gives good feedback. Great course  fav prof interesting  learned a lot.
2,Did not enjoy the lectures  they were clear but I feel that he spent too much time on every idea thus we ran out of time occasionally and it could get boring. He can call on students at random so be aware of being put on the spot. Instructions for our essay were very open-ended and this made it much more difficult. He is a nice guy though for sure!
5,he is a very tough prof  probably the toughest I have ever had but he is by far my favorite. he is a hard marker for essays and has high expectations  but It makes you a better student. He is great to just chat with about issues in class. Overall amazing guy. Totally possible to get 80+ if you hustle all year.
5,One of the BEST professors & truly an EDUCATOR. He makes your standards of other prof's go higher! He cares for your learning & success. Intelligent  funny  approachable  and he makes you THINK. Not for lazy people obviously  welcome to University! He's one of those prof's that changes people lives for the better! TAKE HIS COURSES!
4,He's a great guy. Just impossible to get 80+ in. Class average will be around a low 70 no matter what. You will get no higher than a 75 on the term paper. He's an amazing lecturer  that's it. Final is extremely difficult too.
2,Ridiculous amount of readings for a fourth year class. It seems like its a Masters class but isnt. I barely got a 68 because it was so damn difficult to keep up. Hes a really nice guy but marks really hard and expects too much.
2,Absolutely ridiculous class. 100 pages of reading per week and the professor marks incredibly difficult. Hes a nice guy and you learn a lot but do not expect a 75+.
5,Spears was an amazing prof! He genuinely cares about the students and tries to remember the names of all of the students in order to develop a more personal relationship. He'll go out of his way to help you and definitely makes lectures interesting. He's always up for a discussion during class which allows students to gain more knowledge.
5,8:30AM 3 hour seminar. Quiz every class. 100+ pages of reading/week. Tough marker. That all being said  it was genuinely a privilege to be in Ian Spears 4th year class. It is the most eye opening  provocative and inspirational course at Guelph. He cares about his students and wants them to think critically about every reading. Take this class.
5,Ian Speers is a amazing prof  he's the reason I'm considering to be Politics prof in future. He's really inspiring and helpful in class. However  he encourages to read and attend to classes a lot. So if you're not interested you might have a hard time.
5,Spears is a really great prof! His course is very focused on the readings but he lectures very well and is really funny.
5,Spears is one of those profs that has an almost legendary reputation among students. He's incredibly engaging  friendly  intelligent  and helpful. His classes are not easy. The readings are fairly long  but interesting. He expects high-quality essays  and his examinations require thorough knowledge of all the readings. And yet you'll still love it.
5,My favourite prof. Makes lectures interesting. Always there for his students  helpful  & approachable. Wants you to learn & grow. Presents contrasting arguments to really make you think. No textbook. Content can be challenging so you have to make effort. I like that he encourages class discussion but sometimes he lets people drone on for too long.
5,One of my favourite professors at Guelph. He truly makes lectures enjoyable to attend. I believe he is an extremely fair marker and creates good exams  but his classes are not easy.
5,Best prof I have ever had. Hands down.
5,Spears is amazing. Super passionate about what he does and encourages each pupil to have their own opinion. Really values your participation in class and likes to show you ALL perspectives in order to equip you for the actual world where there is no one answer to anything. Absolute favourite prof at UofG.
4,"Many call him Ian ""the ratface"" spears"
5,Fantastic professor. Cares about his students  our success  & making us think. Was incredibly understanding when I needed extensions and the amount I learned in his class astounds me. Lectures mostly coincide with the textbook & he's great at teaching so you can get good marks. Do your readings  take good notes  come to class  & you can get an A.
4,text sucked for this course.but the professor is extremely helpful.he is not the best lecturer but if you go upto him he explains really well.He is a very nice guy
4,I find it ironic that the people criticizing his English skills also happen to have had the most problems posting a coherent comment for this prof. The irony is delicious...that is  if it you get it.
5,He gave us great midterm and final exams  Thank him. Great Professor.
5,An excellent Professor. Great teaching method. Great explaination. Great mark giving method. Everybody taking his class will like him.r He will be the superstar in York University.r Be proud of him!
5,He is so nice. Especially he gives us the nicest strategy in marks. He is humerous  helpful and kind in class teaching. He can be one of the TOP professor in the year to come.
5,His Math is very excellent. Nobody can challenge him. :)
1,hey needs some english lessions  the sad part is his only first year prof so he'll be around for awhile :(

1,Horrible teacher. Sucked really bad.I failed and was only two points away. She crams to much info. in at one time. The test are never the same as the practice test. She had pet students who set right up next to her in class. Even  my lab instructor said I feel sorry for you guys  I wouldn
1,Horrible teacher. Very unhelpful. She even messed up on my attendance  she said I missed 8 days and my lab instructor backed me up that I didn't miss that much...so there ya go. She sucks. Crams too much into each new week of material. In my book  highly NOT recommended.
1,Very difficult class. O bryan teaches in a horrible manner. And what is up with the pica nic basket booboo. 2 points away and I was failed.
5,really worked for that A :)
1,Hott....very hott...caries a picnic basket a LOT...i dont know why...but not a good teacher...fun to look at  but not a fun teacher.
3.5,HOT teacher  pretty easy. I'd rail it!!!!!
1,she totally failed me  and i was two points away from passing. plush she didnt count my extra credit assignments  which brought my grade down. DO NOT take her
5,WONDERFUL TEACHER. SHE WAS VERY HELPFUL IN EVERYWAY SHE COULD BE. TAKE HER FOR THIS CLASS. BY THE WAY  SHE DOES HAVE A PET PEEVE  DO NOT SPELL HER NAME WRONG!!! OR LET CELL PHONES RING IN CLASS!!
4,very VERY hot!
3,I failed MAT 095 the first time I took it with Blythe. The second time I had prof. O'Brien  and I made it out ok. She's a really nice lady  and helped me out a whole lot even though I'm HORRIBLE at math.
3,I don't know if it's just her or every MATH 095 teacher but that class was hard as hell and MAT 105 was a breeze. A transitional class shouldn't be harder than the regular classes. She crams way too much stuff into each week also.
4.5,Nice teacher.
5,She is a great teacher  she is willings to help her students in any way that she can. She is very undertanding and caring. She is a fun teacher and makes learning math fun and interesting. Excellent teacher  if your having trouble in math i recomened taking O'Bryan b/c she will teach you good.
4.5,I haven't had her for math in college  but I did in high school. I've never had a teacher who went so far out of her way to help students as she did. I sucked at math and she was infinitely patient. One of my favorite teachers...period.
4.5,Good teacher...very sweet and she honestly cares about her students. I think the bad ratings come from people who come in with a predisposition against math  and thusly take it out on her.
1,NO COMMENT!
3,Mrs. O'Bryan is a good teacher. He tests aren't to hard and she is very helpful when needed. Everybody that don't like her  don't know crap about math and that is why they are failing. If you know anything about math...she is the woman to take
2,No Comments
4.5,Very helpful and nice.
5,Very easy class. Easy grader  easy tests  you'll be fine if you skip here and there. All you gotta do is study the given study guides and you'll pass easily. We had 2 papers and you don't even have to try and you'll get a good grade. Highly recommend. ART 200
5,took as a gen ed. requirement. She is very nice  the lectures gets a little boring and she asks that you dont take notes in her class. The midterm and exam are easy  her study guide has the actual answers on the test. Two papers that you write  but shes an easy grader. *would recommend for those who have to take as a gen ed***
5,Professor Sweely is one of my absolute favorite human beings. She is so full of knowledge and you can tell she loves her job. She even makes lectures about thousand year old art interesting. The only down fall of the class is that there are only about 5 grades for the whole year  so you must do well on all of them. Relatively easy A.
5,I love Dr. Sweely! She is the best professor I have ever had. I learned so much from her  about art and life too. Take every class you can with her. I left her class with a huge smile on my face every day. She is a shining star!
5,Dr. Sweely is my favorite professor so far
5,My absolute favorite professor at EKU. She is incredibly kind and caring towards her students  will always make time outside of class and welcomes questions. She is extremely well versed and knowledgable in her subject. Dr. Sweely by far has had the most impact in my academic career. It was an absolute joy to have her as a professor!
5,Gay is a wonderful professor! I have taken her for two courses (ARH 390W and ARH 498). Each course consists of 2 papers and 3-4 Image Exams. Class consists of her opening with a fun video and lecturing with a PowerPoint. No notes need to be taken  she practically gives you the exam on the study guide. Great class and great professor!
4,Dr. Sweely works to make art history enjoyable for her students. She give GREAT study guides  so note taking isn't really necessary!
5,"Dr. Sweely is honestly the sweetest professor I have ever had. The class is easy: 2 tests  2 essays  and an oral report. She doesn't allow you to take notes because she says she ""gives the best study guides in the world."" Lectures are short and interesting. You only need the textbook to study for midterm and final. I recommend 100%! Love her."
5,I wish Dr. Sweely would teach all of my other courses! She is the brightest ray of sunshine even on the gloomiest day. Essays and exams make up the entire course grade.. so do well so you aren't having to bring up your grade all semester. She's so wonderful. I plan on taking another one of her courses next semester.
5,She is the BEST professor and one of the most lovely human beings I have ever met.
5,Wonderful professor! She loves what she does  and she understands that this class isn't essential for your career. All you have to do is write two short  easy papers  a powerpoint presentation  midterm  and final. The midterm/final can be difficult if you're not good at memorizing. But east A!
5,She is probably the nicest professor you will ever have. If you need an easy A for your arts & humanities credit  this is the class and professor for you.
5,She is sweet love her class and care about her student  easy to get an A
5,Loved this class! Lectures were boring sometimes  but it was an interesting class. Gay really loves teaching it  she will repeat that a lot. It is an easy class  not many assignments and the exams are all memorization. Would recommend! Easy A!
5,Loved Dr. Sweely! She is awesome! Not a hard class  and she gives study guides for test. She keeps the class interesting even if you are not into art and there was not many assignments! I would defiantly take her again sweetest lady ever!
5,She is the best. She is easy and funny. It s really easy to get an A in this class. There are 2 homework in this class and one project they r easy to do. There r 2 tests and she gives u the study guide for them. I highly recommend her
4.5,Although the tests are tough she is usually pretty generous with grading in the end if you participate and show up to class. She is quite hilarious and tries to make the subject as painless as possible.
5,I have never had a professor care as much as Dr. Sweely. She genuinely cares about her students. You have to take her as a teacher!
5,Best professor ever! She really cares about her students and art.
5,Professor McCauley is the best professor I have had York. He posts his PowerPoints which makes it easy when studying for the mid term and the final. After taking this class with him I switched my major to sociology. If you have a chance to take a clas with him take it. He is knowledgeable and definitely knows what he is talking about.
1,worst prof I've ever had in 5 years at York! believe me  I studied.. I went to every class lecture.. I even went to the writing department for help and I still managed to get a C on my papers? he's very UNFAIR  everyone gets the same presentation mark.. stay far away if you want to pass! GREAT COURSE  he just taught NOTHING to do with the course
4,Dr. McCauley's class was interesting. I learn a lot about society and social issues.
1,Very disorganized professor. He has yet to embrace the 21st century. His lectures consist of him sitting there and spewing notes with no direction  as if he is reading a Wikipedia page. It's not very clear or concise either  he's not a very good speaker. He does not tell you what he's expecting on assignments and does not respond to emails.
3.5,Prof McCauley got straight to the point during his lectures. Never went off topic. He was a pretty understanding Prof. Although it always seemed like he was in a rush to leave class. The class was usually very quiet so he would always end class early. Pretty easy marker! Always takes attendance but can sometimes be intimidating. Overall  good prof!
5,He takes attendance at the beginning of each lecture. His lectures are not long and they are very clear. He posts them on his website so you don't have to go crazy jotting down everything. His exams come from the slides. Usually a few MC  Concepts and an Essay Q. He is a fair marker. There is also a 40% Essay. He is -also very understanding.
4.5,Dr.McCauley is one of my favorite Professor at York. He's very easy to approach and his teaching is very clear. All tests or exams are based on the lectures' PowerPoint. Study the lecture slides on his website and attend lectures regularly you will definitely do well in this course. Prof. McCauley made sociological theories more interesting
3.5,Good proof gets straight to the point. Know what he s talking about
5,Absolutely wonderful teacher. Very knowledgable. 1test. 1little essay 1major essay. Very sweet Prof.
4.5,He is a solid  grounded and very practical Prof. He simplifies the content and is quite fair. One does need to put some work into this course.
3,Some of the material he teaches is outdated. This was a race and ethnicity class so I was hoping to learn a lot about various ethnic groups. However  we spent a lot of time learning of his study on French and English relations instead. Mid-Term was easy but the course overall was unevenly distributed with too much weight on one paper.
4.5,I think Prof. McCauley is an awesome teacher. He is easy to understand and he makes Sociology interesting. I plan to take more courses with him in the futue
2,This prof seems disengaged and bored when he lectures. He can also be quite blunt and intimidating. 2 short tests + 1 paper (40%) and attendance/participation. I would not recommend this course to anyone unless they are knowledgeable on religions.
1,Disorganized. His lecture slides are all over the place. But very understanding in terms of deadlines.
5,I had no previous exposure to sociology. Prof. Tim McCauley made it very interesting
5,Dr. McCauley is the best prof for this course. I was a bit scared going into this course because everything seemed so abstract at first but he dumbed everything down for us and made it all so crystal clear. By far  one of the best profs at York. His lectures were short  quick  and sweet. He is also very easy on the eyes
5,The best prof at york... just read his notes and you will definately do well....
3,Alright prof. Classes were rather monotonous since he's a slide reader. All important info is on the slides. Make sure you copy the slides in class as much as possible  since some info is missing or different on the slides he provides online. TA's are useless and have unrealistic expectations  but prof is willing to help with any issues.
3,He relies very heavily on his power point slides. Most  if not all  of his lecture is simply reading what the slides say. He also moves too fast at times  and says that the slides will be available on his website  though they were not available until a week before the exam. Do the readings! They round out the important concepts in lecture.
5,I owe him a great part of my success in grad school. I was lucky to have the chance to have him for 3 courses through which I learned a lot and found great interest in sociology. He is an intellectual and an experienced  inspiring  and helpful prof. He encourages his students to think analytically and his lectures are very valuable and informative.
5,If you strive to do more than just learn the material you will average out. She is a professor who is passionate  and therefore has high expectations. Prepares you for the real world.
2,Awful teacher! Not very helpful  rude and inconsiderate  makes things a lot harder than they need to be
5,Awesome!!! :)
4.5,Best teacher I've ever had. Very nice  knows her material  really enjoyed the class.
5,Shes a very nice teacher and knows her material. but the class is a one credit class  and we have homework ALOT and the test are really really hard! I have a C so far and im working harder on that class than my 3 credit 300 level courses.
5,All around great professor
5,Very good teacher. She helped me out a lot.
5,HOT HOT HOT HOT (kinda short) HOT HOT HOT doesn't care if you're there or not

5,dr adams is awesome!
5,I had her for aerobic walking...she's awesome  she would let us play basketball  tennis  anything if the weather was nice. Besides how hard can aerobic walking be?
5,She's Awesome
5,She's a good teacher  there's a lot of class discussion  her tests are challenging  but she gives you all the material you need. The only bad thing about the class are the clinical hours.
5,No Comments
5,at first i didnt like her  but once you get to know her and get comfortable around her then you will be fine!
3.5,No Comments
4,No Comments
2,needs to retire..past her prime...one of the worst teachers ive hade thus far at the BAC
5,She was one of my best Professors - her classes were memories I will keep for life. Thank you!
5,she is by far the most intelligent  expirienced and interetsing professor at the school. she is insanely energetic as a professor. her courses are difficult  but well worth it. one of the best professors i've had in 3 very respected schools
2,Nice lady  interesting and knowledgable  and likes her students. But VERY BAD at breaking things down so that they are clear for the students. Wanders off topic all the time. Many times will put her opinions and interpretations forward as the things we should learn  rather than discussing and focusing on the ideas from the class readings.
1,No Comments
4.5,an amazing woman to know. one of the greatest teachers the B.A.C. will ever have
4.5,Challenging class. Ingrid is the best.
1,Mr. Hood is the most incompetent instructor I have ever had.
1,Many know that the world was created in six days and on the seventh day the Flying Spaghetti Monster rested. What is unknown is that on the eighth day the Flying Spaghetti Monster realized that all of humankind understood the concept of significant figures  so He created Donald Linn Hood.
5,Many know that the world was created in six days and on the 7th day God rested. What is unknown is that on the 8th day God looked down on his kingdom and was displeased  so he created Don Hood.
4,He is actually a nice guy  even though he appears to be tough.
1.5,..... and not only that  his instructions in his lab manual are horrible. Not much clarity  and you basically have to figure out on your own and out of the blue how to solve some of the post-labs. Absolutely ridiculous. His exams have the most random questions  A LOT of which is not even study'able from his notes. Confusing and unclear questions.
1.5,Mr. Hood is very unfair with his grading policies. He is one of those teachers who TRY HARD to take points off of assignments  and with lab worth only 300-350 pnts  each point counts. SLU overall seems that way now  trying to weed people out  especially in chem lab. Don is not of any help  nor is he courteous when students have questions. Arrogant.
5,He is such an amazing person he is always willing to help you out  he doesn't like freshman very much but he has always been more than helpful and his knowledge is spread out throughout all the chem classes he helps me with organic and analytical as we.
1.5,Don Hood is an **** to all Freshmen. He will never compromise even if he is blatantly wrong  or if he mis-graded something. If you try and talk to him about your grade he will instantly dismiss you as just being incompetent. This guy is a real ****!
1,Don Hood is one of the most uncompromising  unhelpful  and self-righteous men I have ever met. The grading procedures/policies are completely subjective and depends only on which TA grades your lab. Even though there is no way to avoid this miserable lab  do not be surprised if a TA helps you with one of the labs and you still end up with a 5/15
3,I dont understand how someone so arrogant can teach in a university and be an example. When he screams at you  you can see how he thiks he is cool just because of that. Really childish person  get away from him..
1.5,couldn't wait for it to be over!
5,Don Hood is a very good instructor. Do not let him intimidate you  it's only for show. He is extremely helpful
5,In the beginning  I was terrified of the infamous Don Hood  but then he turned out to be quite nice. He was rarely ever in lab. Really helpful. Just don't mess around in lab and follow the dress code  and you will be fine.
5,Intimidating at first  but he's nice once you get to know him. Follow directions  don't ask stupid questions and don't screw around in lab.
4,He's never around except for grading  so pray for a helpful TA. Makes sure every point is scrutinized.
2,No Comments
4.5,don't use white-out or pencil... if you follow that policy and the dress code than you'll be fine
3.5,Maybe a little scary at times  but he really is helpful and a nice guy when it comes down to it.
3,Can be arrogant at times  but overall he really does care and wants you to succeed....you really can't avoid him if you have to take lab--so just get used to his style. realize he has good intentions. Approachable most of the time....
2,he's kind of lame. the videos on the cd to prepare us for class are funny. he never really comes in except to yell at people for their clothes. make sure you always have your lab sheets and goggles. your ta will be your teacher so i hope you have a good one like i do!
4,Honestly  I just go to class to look at him.
4,Dr. Fisher is really funny. He's undoubtedly very knowledgable  but he lectures EXTREMELY fast. I recommend rewatching Tegrity for his lectures  because he often elaborates on his slideshows & says things that're not written down but that he will test you on. On the tests  he usually never takes questions directly from his HW  he rewords them
5,Not too shabby  enjoyed him
5,You can tell he is passionate about teaching and his lectures are highly educational. He throws in funny remarks during his lectures to keep class interesting. Use his homework as a way to keep track of what to study. He also gives out old tests with answer keys before each exam.
5,This guy is so great I honestly have never experienced anything like this in my entire life. Whether he is cycling around campus or lecturing  Jon Fisher exudes charisma and biology. I learned so much about both biology and myself. It really hurt when he left us to Ogilvie  a nice  smart but extremely annoying lady. Where have you gone Jon?
4,Dr. Fisher is super chill guy and his lectures are easy to pay attention. However  his tests are super detail oriented and have lots of small things. All in all though  I would definitely take his class again.
3.5,Fisher was the funniest biology professor I've had. If you payed attention during lecture and read the chapters  the class was easy. Would take him second semester if I could.
4,Dr. Fisher was awesome  he says the funniest corny jokes during class. He keeps his lectures interesting. Records all lectures on tegrity  but you have to come to class in order to get the clicker points. Tests were not difficult for me but were difficult for classmates. Class averages on exams were usually in the low 70s. Final exam was easy
1,He speaks very monotone and does not keep students engaged by any means. Thus  it is very hard to stay awake and the way he presents material makes it difficult to remember. This makes the exams incredibly difficult. The exams are also random and unrelated to in-class information. Fisher is also very wishy-washy when it comes to class policies.
3,This guy is HYSTERICAL. His class is fairly easy (as easy as bio can get--some topics are just difficult by nature and that's OK)  but he isn't SUPER clear on what's supposed to be on the test. With that in mind  tests are still pretty fair and he's definitely the most fun professor to take. Wish he was teaching second semester!
4,Moved through material quickly but was really knowledgeable and explained key concepts well.
4.5,Dr. Fisher taught the first half of the semester of my class  and I really enjoyed taking his class. He explained everything very well and always made sure to answer questions sufficiently. The best part of his class is his great sense of humor that makes each class interesting without taking academic value away from the class.
3.5,Dr. Fisher was a great professor. I liked his lectures  he tried to keep it interesting  and sometimes he'll share a scrap of his personal life. He tries to answer any questions during a lecture. I never used office hours  but I knew they were available. His tests aren't bad compared to other bio professors. Bio is just a hard course overall.
5,What a GREAT class! Dr. Fisher is a wonderful teacher and probably one of the most interesting and clear Biology teachers I've had at Saint Louis. If you have the chance to take him  make sure you do. Four tests total and online assignments which are optional. The tests can be tricky- so make sure that you study the material well.
4,Exercise Physio was an incredibly fascinating and relatable class. That being said  Fisher is a very specific grader on free response questions and his multiple choice items aren't very easy. You can only miss 2 questions on the entire test to get the lowest A  something that is almost guaranteed to happen. The material gets tough..its a hard class
3,Fisher seems like an articulate  personable guy and his lectures are interesting and simple to grasp. That being said  he's condescending in office hours and his tests never reflected the concepts he stressed in class. It's definitely not the easy elective people make it out to be  but it's probably the most interesting higher level biology class.
4.5,Nice Guy. Easy class if you have some background in Bio  like from highschool. Lectures are alright.
5,Very clear lectures. I liked him better than Nordell. Tests are tough  generally easy quiz points.
5,He is a great professor. Explains everything clearly. The class was somewhat easy  but there is lots of reading involved.
5,Awesome. Very helpful  very approachable. If you try in class  and do the reading  you'll do fine.
3.5,Financial Markets one of The most imperativo al Courses from Finance (15-3) Curriculum with Andrew lo very Inspirational
3.5,When i took Fin 15.401 was called Finance Theory. He is funny and gives amazing lectures . The Exams are a little Hard but manageable. He gives an Excelent Foundation of Managerial and Corporate Finance . He leads the Laboratory for Financial Engineering thats awesome. Is a Finance Master mind

1,the class was so boring. He is my worst teacher in my life.
1.5,This may be the most repugnant instructor of my entire education.
1,No Comments
3.5,It's nice to have a believer teaching in a Dept. (Philosphy) that has knothing but secluar instructors. If your christian take him.
5,Great teacher! He taught me so much about writing a good paper. I've never recieve so much feedback on my writing from a teacher before. He's funny and keeps it interesting.
5,GREAT teacher! Knows his field extremely well. I actually looked forward to his classes. Lots of essays to write  but that's expected in an English course. Makes time fly with humorous stories and comments. Definitely recommended.
3,This man is the most self-absorbing  egotistical  self-impressed individual I have met in a very  very long time. Needs to check his manners in regard to condensending over-tones in class toward students. Thankfully  I did well in this class. Obviously  did not care for his teaching style nor his mannerisms toward students. :-(
5,LOVE the Doctor! Would take him for any class he teaches  just an all around neat guy!
4.5,I feel bad for how much my friends and I fooled around during class. He was a little boring at time  but I think it was more the subject. He knows what he teaches very well.
5,I count this class as a height in my college experience. Do you desire to be a better writer? I encourage you to learn from the best. Richard will help you develope as a writer. He doesn't wear his religion on his sleeve  but God's love radiates from his heart.
5,Mr. Doctor is a really great teacher. He is really open to people and is open about himself. At first  because of his personality I thought it would be an extremely easy class  but actually it wasn't. He grades papers more difficultly than in ENG 101. Overall  he is a great teacher though  you have to do work though.
5,great guy  great teacher  highly recommend him
5,Great instructor! He always keeps the class interested and is good at helping you when you need it. As long as you show up for class and write papers the way he wants them written and do the readings  you will get a good grade in the class.
3.5,This teacher seems to be very impressed with himself & discourages independent thinking. Write papers the way he wants you to write them & you will do fine. Also  seems to find humour in humiliating students. This I find unexcusable behavior in a professional. Needs to reevaluate teaching style.
5,Doctor is the best. Intelligent and informative lectures. Put effort into the class and you'll do fine. Take him.
5,Best English prof I ever had... I am a much better writer and thinker for having had him. You will work for your grade  but it's worth it. Highly recommended.
5,Richard does NOT discourage independent thinking - quite the opposite. I disagreed with him completely  and still aced my papers. What looks for  and teaches  is quality and clarity of exposition. Express yourself well  and you will do well.
2,He is very hard and seems to be a hard grader and so forth....
2,very self impressed. Discourages independent thinking in his students. Just write what you believe he will want you to write and you will do just fine. Unfortunately  that isn't the way to foster a real voice among students now is it?
4.5,Best techer I hever had  but he makes you work for it!
3.5,Richard is awesome.. great sense of humor  extremely knowledgable. Tough grader  but he will really improve your writing ability!
3.5,No Comments
4,He is a very smart man with a terrible dry sense of humor. Grades papers quite tough. Follow his examples and write papers exactly like he suggests and you'll ace the class.
5,HE WAS AN AWESOME TEACHER HE IS PASSIONATE IN WHAT HE TEACHES. HE LIKES DETAILS THOUGHS! BUT I WOULD TAKE HIM AGAIN HE IS AN AWESOME TEACHER
5,This dude is incredibly well-spoken and humble. He never talks down to his students and always respects their views. He makes the class a very chill experience  and as long as you do the inquisitives  you will definitely pass. In terms of the tests  he lets you use an index card and I'd recommend just writing timeline  so you can nail chronology.
4,Just keep up with your work and you will be fine
5,Cares about students
5,He is someone who I'd call an intellectual. I could just sit down and listen to him talk about things he's passionate about. Very smart  funny  and gives great lectures. If you turn in a paper he marks grammatical errors and work cited mistakes. take good notes and refer to the book. You have to work for your grade but he makes it very enjoyable.
5,Dr. James is an awesome instructor. His tests are great  but beware of chronological order. As long as you try  you will be just fine. If you love history take his class. I've had two classes with him and got an A both times.
5,James is a fantastic teacher. If you bomb the midterm or final it will not kill you. The inquizzitives he gives are impossible to fail and are an easy A. He is heavy on reading. The debates he gives are fantastic and another easy A. I would definitely take him again!
5,His lectures are engaging. Best professor at Coastal. Prepares you for the exams by making the course fun and interesting.
5,Dr. James is filled with tons of excellent information. He provides resources to help guide you through the readings. Participation and doing assignment using the resources provided you are sure to do well.
2.5,Having emails ignored wasn't all that great  especially when I was struggling in the class. For the most part  if you read the textbook and really study the material you can do good on the tests. You have to read two short books and do a group project  reflection  and quiz on them. The inquisitive assignments are impossible to fail.
3.5,Dr. James  At first I was hesitant to take his class as I signed up for another professor but the class was split due to size. I am very glad I had Dr. James. His tests are long and he is a little disorganized at times but his lectures are fun and he is very passionate about history. Will make you work for your grade! Overall I really liked him.
5,Very passionate about teaching. I was worried about taking him. He seemed like he would be a tough teacher that didn't care about students passing (on day one) I couldn't have been more wrong. He was very knowledgeable and willing to answer questions. Quizzes are MC and based on reading. Exams are short answer and essays. Know MLA format 4 papers
4,Not the easy A  but he makes that clear from Day 1. You will work for it. The essays are easy  just don't wait until the last day to do them. Study for the quizzes by doing the activities on nortonstudyspace and read the corresponding page numbers from the quizzes flashcards or you will fail them. Good lectures and invested in his students.
2.5,"Welcome to college! Because in this class  You MUST read the textbook  you have to write 4 papers. He doesn't give out a study guide. He says ""the lecture is on one wavelength  the textbook is on another  and the tests cover both wavelengths"". You MUST study before the tests. I'll be surprised if I pass the class."
2,Lectures are good but quizzes aren't based on them. Gives A LOT of work and assigns 70 pgs to read for every 2 days. When I took his class I was taking four others. THANK GOD my other classes didn't have a big load of homework like he did. For the Exams he tells you that its covers things that are on the outline  which is basically everything.
2.5,You have to read the textbook or you won't pass any quizzes or tests. Quizzes are worth 16% and each exam is 20%. Majority of the time  his quizzes aren't based on his lectures.
3.5,Good teacher. If you miss class you will get set back. Must read the book in order to make good grades on the tests. Each class is lecture based. Mid terms are pretty clear cut. Just like any other history class. Not hard  but you have to apply yourself.
1.5,I do not recommend his class to anyone who is not a history fanatic. He assigns an ungodly amount of reading and has quizzes every week with other assignments as well. He is not clear when you ask him how you should study. If you can take another professor  I highly recommend it. He also had 2 midterms and 2 finals. Super hard class to pass.
4,I really liked him. I took his class on-line. He does a lot of discussion boards and you have to write a few papers. But he is a very good instructor. I learned a lot from his class.
5,He was great! He does expect a lot. You have to read and take a lot of notes  but he does keep it interesting.
5,(210)This class is really easy you get study guides for the test look up what's on the study guide and you got an A in the class. Lectures are pointless you don't really learn anything. 200 is fun if you liked Health and Phys. Ed. in highschool that's basically all it is you don't really learn why you do the tests you just kinda do them.
5,cool teacher  and makes the subject very easy. If you don't do well in this class it will be your fault
4.5,Teaching middle school ed was a fun class. There is a lot of gym activities  and a few class room assignement. There arent many tests  and a few quizzes. Go to class  and do the readings  and you should be fine. He is a good teacher!!
5,This prof is one of the best. His sense of humor helps u remember and learn the material. The workload is just right and his tests aren't difficult but not easy either. I would highly recommend him u will learn a lot!
4.5,Mr. Clark had to be the best teacher i have had all year. Go to class and you should get an A IN Fundy's and Motor if you go to class and study for the tests its an easy A as well. I learned to Juggle in Fundy's which was the best thing i learned all year!i highly recommend this prof!
4,Motor Development and Fundies are both really boring! You will read everything you need to know for Motor Development from the book. His Lectures are a waste of time. However  both classes are very easy.
4.5,All he needs to do is show up on time and he's one of the best professors around. Has lots of experiance  minimal effort required for an A in his classes.
4,Very easy Prof.. all you have to do is read and go to class. He is late ALL the time though. He doesn't exactly teach at a college level (usually lower) The material is interesting and he never tries to over analyze a topic and keeps things pretty simple.. He's cool and most of the time funny
4,good professor. tests can be hard so make sure you read. he occasionally is funny with his weird sense of humor  keeps class interesting. you can tell he enjoys teaching.
4,cool guy  only had him for a week but seems real easy to get along with and definately tries to keep you interested in his topic
5,good teacher very helpful and easy to get along with
5,He made motor development very fun and interesting. Here's a secret the final exam is the study guide he gives you or at least it was for us. Good teacher he still remembers me and I took him last semester.
4,Very easy. Has an attendance policy only because he has nothing else to grade or challenge you with. Easy A if you go to class.
3.5,class is fun and he is not a bad professor...reallly likes to talk to much though
5,ALthough he is always late for class  overall he's a pretty good prof. He has a strange sense of humor  but tries to make class interesting. His tests can be somewhat tricky  so I recommend reading the book thoroughly if you want to do good on his exams
4.5,usually late to class  but funny and not boring.
1.5,For someone who is all about being professional and being on time  he sure is late EVERY day. His class is rather pointless and very boring. He needs to teach at a college level  not kindergarden.
2.5,No Comments
5,Tosha was the best professor I've ever had bachelors and masters level included. She also makes a wonderful advisor. She's usually willing to take on new advisees
5,I really liked Tosha. She was a really great teacher and I learned a lot about literacy and children.
5,Best teacher at Saint Rose yet. Tosha really knows her stuff and teaches it the way that we should teach it to young children. Very hands on and so caring! Highly reccommended!
5,One of the nicest and helpfull professors at the college. She also is very intelligent and understanding.
4.5,Wonderful experience. Made a weekend class enjoyable and meaningful. She focused on real aspects of teaching and ways to improve the system.
1,I actually went to the University and forged a complaint against him because he was at the point (back in 02) where he couldnt write clearly anymore  everybody in class would ask him to translate his writing  which are part of his lectures  all done on an
2.5,Hard prof.  boring man  old as the hills  nice but dry.
4.5,Top notch professor - knows his****!!! Ask him anything on entemology and he will have some info about it. Very well respected in the working community by biologists  entomologists  ecologists and the like. Helped me get a job. Now he's retired and doing what he wants.
5,Great Prof. He will be missed!
5,No Comments
5,I had him for one summer and enjoyed him tremendously. He is a funny and kind man. He cared about my grade alot and was willing to help. Great prof!
4,I took a summer class with him once and it was fun. We had a lot of outdoor activities  like going to Yellow Creek. Not a hard class  and he's a fun guy (likes talking about diseases a lot). If you can take your intro course with him do it.
1.5,He don't care to teach...if you care to learn don't take him!
1,She is the worst teacher I have ever had in my entire life. She marked me wrong if i did my math vertically instead of horizontally(ex. multiplication) or if my fratcion lines were diagonal instead of horizontal...im not joking. She wont allow you to have scrap paper  and then takes points off if there are scribble marks on your paper. SUCKS!!!!!!
1,It is a huge discredit to CCSU and to Dr. Craine that this woman is allowed to continue teaching. She is horrid both as a teacher and as a person. What goes around comes around and this woman is surrounded by bad karma!
4,takes attendance every day  need to be there. Very stubborn on how she wants things written her way  and if you dont write it her way its wrong. nice  funny lady. not an easy class however  takes 3rd grade math and makes it very hard somehow. if you put a lot of time in youll pass  if not its very stressful  dont go out of your war to take this cla
2.5,Pretty crazy  had favorites  randomly collected homework which she spends half of class going over  i don't recommend her
4.5,shes a pretty good teacher. a little boring but easy and she tries so hard to be funny...
1.5,This teacher is highly unfair. She took off points because i rounded .306 to .31. This teacher also takes points off for not erasing something completely or having something crossed out on the page. I highly recommend that you avoid this class at all costs  definetly not worth it. Worst professor i've had so far at ccsu  i hate her!!
1,"My little sister could pass the course on the material but i think she took off points for spelling my name wrong. Again she tooks off points for correctly answering the question as explained in the book but not as she explained in class... the book must have been wrong?!Since when has ""pie"" been a ****ing variable. makes 3rd grade math confusing!"
4,she's crazy  but it makes the class more exciting. best math teacher i've had since 3rd grade. she does take off a lot of points if things aren't written the way she likes  but she warns you about it beforehand. class went by quickly and lets you out early most of the time. good person
2,its 4th grade work that we did but her grading system is terrible. you get points off because youre not putting all the equal signs the way she wants it  or your work is messy  or overly erased  or not placed under the original example  when you should get 100 you end up getting like a 80 because of all the extra points she takes off. yack.
1,this teacher sucks so bad- i would RUN away if you are thinking about taking her- she is ****ing retarded- wont help you and grading system is completely unfair- do yourself a favor and dont take her EVER!
4,Slightly crazier then a can of dried peaches.
1,Ok i dont know if i should write something  but i sat in her class just for the first day and DROPPED IT!! She presented the class as if we were in elementary school and frightened me. the work load appeared to be too hard for a 100 level class and so i just wanted to warn people before they jumped head first into that classroom. good luck!
1.5,HORRIBLE!! avoid taking this teacher at all costs- she will help you- but it doesnt matter because she doesnt know how to teach anyways!!
3,Her grading system is rediculous. Homework and quizzes count double what tests count and if you do bad on a homework assignment you can have your grade drop a lot. iDid bad on one homework assignment  took me from an A to a low C. Nice person and even a decent teacher  but terrible grading system. Avoid her!
2,Her grading system totally sucks for tests and homework. The only reason I went to class was because she was so strict about attendence.
2,Worst teacher ever! She takes points off on a test if you mispell a word  and last I checked this wasn't an english class. Seriously DO NOT take this class with her as the professor
1,Beware! I have never failed a class before until this one. I did all the work but her grading sucks! It's stupid how she corrects hw. She only picks 2 questions out of the entire sheet and if u get the rest right except those 2 she checks  its an F! She should NOT be teaching!
1,she sucks...she fails u on a test NOT BECAUSE THEY ANSWERS ARE WRONG but because u didnt put the equal signs in the right spot..freakin ****
3,do not take a math class with this woman. the classes are pointless  she tells bad jokes  and nothing gets accomplished. she grades very hard and if u dont do something her way ull fail. i would definitely not recommend her.
3,Pretty condescending and likes to be a dictator  which she'll tell you from the beginning. If you don't do every little thing her way  you're not going to do well  no matter if a different way works better for you or not. Good as a person but wouldn't recommend her as a professor.
1,Worst Spanish teacher ever. I'm a fluent Spanish speaker and I failed her class. She does not know how to teach Spanish in a way beginners would understand. I bought the textbook and never used it. I had to correct her multiple times during class to. DONT TAKE HER CLASS
1,Don't take this class. The feeling you get on the first day that tells you maybe to drop it and take something else-- listen to that  because by mid semester if you are a beginner   you will be buried with the course work and she won't give you the help you need.
1,Thankfully I've been doing well in Shea's class but ONLY because I took Spanish in high school. My heart goes out to the students in class who really have never taken Spanish. Students sitting next to me clearly study their ass off  to no avail. Shea is unclear and doesn't fully address questions. Terrible at teaching. Spanish beginners  DONT TAKE!
3,She's really confusing at times so try to pay attention she is VERY serious about only talking in spanish from the minute you walk in the door. You have chapter tests and have lots of Temas every week. Having the text book is a MUST. You spend most of class talking to other people over microphones in spanish so if you aren't social good luck
5,I really enjoy her. She is stern when it comes to being responsible and paying attention. She makes it clear that she is not your mom and will not hold you hand. You have to work for your grade and do the simple online assigned work.If you need help or clarification she will give it to you. Also you MUST have a book of your own
3,If you are going to take this class  be sure to rely on your book. Professor Shea is not always clear. But she is willing to help you in office hours.
2,Not a great teacher. Doesn't teach beginning material like you would expect in a beginning class. Assumes you've taken 4 years of High School spanish like I had. Had I not though  I would have failed. Take heart though  you can still get a 90% without doing any homework if this is review for you!
3.5,Shea is a great woman and is really passionate about Spanish and the different cultures and places. I just wish there was more in class conversation as the class is dependent on writing with the workbook  journals and paragraphs. Basically turn everything in on time and you can do well  her tests aren't difficult if you pay attention in class.
2,Very friendly teacher  and lots and lots of hw! 3 presentations last one is worth 5%. Dairies are a must  do not miss 1 if you are going for a A  worth 35% of your grade. All of class time is working in the book with your partners and presenting it to the teacher. She calls on you with cards that have your name  although classwork is not graded.
4.5,she is a great teacher  i took her last semester and she became very fermliar with all the students very fast by learning our names faster then most teachers. her lectures start at the begining of class and end at the end of class. she wastes no time during the class time. even this semester she stops and talkes to me see how im doing. over all gre
1.5,Lame professor. She only has one way of teaching. Cant explain the material in a different way. no help outside of class  and she told me maybe i should drop. take a different professor.
2,um i can sum this professor up in two words   She sucks! Nice lady  but that doesnt cout towards her teaching ability. she focus way to much on the culture   and not enough on what we need to know to pass her class. she just expects people to know. Any ding dong can read the book  but she cant really help explain what it is that we are learning.
5,Profe Shea is a genius. Seriously  she is brilliant. Try talking to her about how she learned Spanish. She is an exceptional professor and uses a combination of activities  powerpoints  cultural things and the textbook to teach. I absolutely loved taking Spanish 2 with her and learned so much. She's a fair grader and likes to tease her students.
2.5,Unless you need help  she's an easy  enthusaitic instructor. If you don't test well  in my particular case. You may find yourself suprised. In my situation she actually TOLD me a little over halfway through the class to drop  get a w  and try again. She doesn't seem to want ALL students to succeed. There is NO help outside of class by the way.
5,Awesome teacher. Very enthusiastic  very brilliant. She loves her job  and always has everything planned out so well.
4,Very good professor...my prayers are with her as she just lost her son in Iraq.
3,I really enjoyed being in her classes. She's very interested in her students. She could focus more on the grammer than the culture  but overall I really liked her. Too bad what happened to her son.
3.5,the class is kinda boring but i guess yoou get your units
4.5,A very nice teacher. Helps you understand it and test are not very hard  but you must do your hmk to pass. Makes you study  but she is a very good teacher.
3.5,She's fluent  and she'll take time to understand you. Beware though. She'll make you comfortable in class  talk about everyone makes mistakes  then go though your tests with a fine-tooth comb!!
5,I took Norm's classes 20 years ago when he first came to IC. I am back in college again after lo these many years and still  Norm's teaching remains impactful. His clarity  passion and adventurous spirit along with his no b.s. modality of keeping things moving and challenging are even more valuable now as I look back. Best of the best  this one.
4.5,Hard teacher  but all of his pushing is so you can find the better you. He gave me a really hard time and I thank him for it. Love  love  love me some Norman and his wrestling boots.
4,I LOVE NORM. He makes you find the magic for yourself  which can be frusrating  but in the end  it makes you so much more fulfilled.
4,Norm is great. You have to buy into what he teaches (like you do with ALL acting teachers) in order to swear by him  but once you submit and commit-he can change your life. I encourage you all to at least try what Norm has to offer before you judge it.
3.5,"Norm is a great guy  but he plays favorites. Also  I don't seem to agree with his opinions on ""good theater."""
5,Great teacher! Inspiring!
5,Dr. NoJo has really enlivened my ideas about theatre and hell  about life too. He is an amazingly passionate teacher and an captivating director. Come back from sabbatical  Norm! 2007 loves you!
5,Dr. NoJo is a genius who allows you to discover an incredible amount about yourself and the art of acting.
4.5,"Norm was by far the best Acting coach I had. He allowed the actor to find their own technique with the tools he supplied. He allowed discovery  and kept acting fun. That is why we do it  he was one of the few to ""Those who can't do  teach"" does"
1,doesn't really know anything about acting  very pompous  doesn't care about his students
1,very pretentious
3.5,Norm's awesome. Hands down.
3,I don't even HAVE NoJo for a class--he is the coordinator of the Acting program  and almost everyone seems to love him... they say he's a genius  so that's good--but they also say that if you love Norm  you hate Greg Bostwick  which is SO inconceivable.
1,The reviews are most definitely correct about her . She is very defensive  and wont let you get a point across . She is very funny but rude at time . The class is a easy grade tho . The book is not really needed buy an online book for cheap .
2,She is RUDE  RUDE  RUDE. If you do not agree with her  ask questions on assignments  or try to take notes. She will get defensive  tell you off in front of the class or just give you a bad grade for that particular assignment just because she can. This is by far the WORST prof. I've had since attending this school. BE MINDFUL of the reviews.
3,She's a great teacher. She's funny. She talks to us  and the whole class is a conversation. It's a class that you wouldn't mind going to. Group discussions are great. Group discussions are most of the class. Because we all give our individual opinions  it's easy to learn and be engaged.
1,By far the worst teacher  I have had. Wish I paid more attention to her reviews. Majority are 100% accurate  save yourself the headache.
5,Great teacher  im taking her class right now and that is the best class i have this semester. Shes funny  and full of good jokes while talking about the book. Read the book and do the HW and you will pass her class with an easy A. Oh and participate to the conversations  because Mrs Allen has a grade for participation. Take her class.
4,She is nice and a very social person. Her tests are relatively simple as long as you study and know terms and common sense. She is a teacher you will definitely remember after the class.
2,Never Take her CLASS!! gets off topic always  never teaches only reads from the book wasting the time by telling stories makes fun out of people who disagree with her opinions! PLEASE DONT TAKE HER CLASS!!!
1,this was one of the worst teacher i've had. we get off topic alot and if you don't agree with what she says. she shows animosity towards you.You can never make an A on any of her assignments and forgets everything that she says in the previous class.Laugh at all of her stale jokes unless you'll end up failing her class because shes just vindictive
5,this lady does not have her head up her ass. she is brilliant. pay attention to the subtle. and enjoy a fun class for a change.
4,took her for sociology. she's not hard at all but she will get off topic  A LOT. Read the book to pass because she speaks of things in the book prob. 40% of the class.
3.5,Good teacher. Very funny  however she does tend get off topic. She doesnt give any homework..but if no one reads the material prior to class  then she'll start. There's only one research paper and 3 test. She can be a bit sarcastic but I found her to be hilarious. I take her again in a heartbeat. Just make you study and be on time.
4,I took Mrs Allen Fall of 2011.Two thngs you need to know: (1)because she gets off topic a lot you HAVE to read the material before class  and (2)class participation is a MUST!She can be a little sarcastic but she means no harm. Laugh at her jokes  be on time to class & read the material = easy A.
3,"Do not challenge her  and if you don't agree with her  you will become her enemy. She can be very rude and disrespectful in a sneaky way  so that it doesn't bring everyone's attention to her  only to the person whom she is attacking. I got an ""A"" in her class but I would not take another class taught by her. She seems to have issues with foreigners"
2.5,"She is very opinionated  and if you disagree with her you become her enemy. She can be rude and disrespectful in a sneaky way that doesn't bring everyone's attention to it  only to the person whom she is attacking. I received an ""A"" in the class  but I wouldn't take another class taught by her. She seems to have issues with foreigners."
1,Honestly she is the worst teacher I have ever had. She only reads the definitions from the book. We always got off topic so we really never discussed anything of importance. Very opinionated. She shows favoritism and if you're not on her good side you won't do well. DON'T TAKE HER!!
4.5,Best Teacher I have ever had  she made coming to College and expectation instead of a pain  she treats everyone equal and u will never be bored. Im really going to miss this class because there is really none like her
5,Professor Julia Allen is a wonderful and also a knowledgeable person. She makes the class fun! We had debates on everything. If you are smart you will take her!!!! Last but not least...she grades on the curve!
2,If you want to make an A don't take her. She is to opinionated that if your answers don't agree with what she think is right she is going to mark it wrong. She doesn't know how to grade or teach. This class will be a self taught class so read your book everynight!...or just don't take her.
4,She feels strongly about research and her opinion behind the research. No point in arguing with her  just take in the information she shares. If you read the book in depth  the test won't be hard. The only reason she'll quizzes is if too many students are late. She gave spontaneous homework  nothing strenuous.
3.5,Ms Allen was a great instructor not only about Sociology I learned so much from her she is very human. Attitude is everything she treats every one equal Mrs. Allen was a great professor! She is very entertaining & teaching
1,She is clearly one of the worse professors I have ever had. She doesn't understand the topic and therefore can't explain or answer simple questions. We hardly used the book and the test were nothing like the study guide or anything we did in class.
4.5,If you attend class everyday  you do you're homework  and come to her with your questions  the class will become alot eaisier. Math isn't hard  it's just a challenge. Ms. Nelson really knows what she's doing and she never gives an excuse for why she can't explain problems. Plus  she's cheerful (most times) by nature so that helps!!
1,She simply goes over the problems in the book. She doesn't even lecture!!!
1,She simply goes over the problems in the book. She doesn't even lecture!!!
4.5,I took a 4 week calc 2 course and was sure I was going to fail. She is one of the most helpful teachers I've ever had. She gives you every opportunity she can to pass the class. I made a 40-something on the final an I still made a 75 in the class!!! If you take her just make sure you do your online quizes.
5,She is the best math teacher EVER!!! I started the class thinking I would fail. But she teaches SO WELL and gives you EVERY opportunity to pass the class!! She responds back to emails very quickly  and always asks all students to come by her office any time with any questions. SHE ACTUALLY LOVES TO HELP YOU PASS!!
5,very helpful  she will make you love math
4.5,She is a good helper when you ask her any questions. She spend a lot of time explaining any math problems that you do not understand (if you come to her office). She requires a lot of work from you. Overall  she's great.
1.5,She doesnt seem to care about her job very much. No emails  no updates. Group project which is really only required discussions between students. Not a fun math class.
4.5,I think that she is great. No  really  you do some work  but hey  she helps you and it is possible to get a good grade....like I did.
4.5,She was a good teacher. You can ask lots of questions. Sometimes she's a little unorganizd but she is very helpful. I'd take her again.
5,ms nelson is one of the best teacher. she deal with the problem and visit desk to desk until the student is not clear .she is very helpful and she makes the course very easir so i will not be able to find any teacher better than her.i am planning to take the same teacher in the next calculus class but its my unfortunate that she is not going to tak
2.5,expects students to have learned the material before she teaches it...she does not spoon feed but she also does not explain it herself...not very effective for most poeple. a majority of the classwork(online  quizes  work)is doen by yourself and at home or online...
5,You quizzes was helpfull to me  your explainations were clear and easy to understand. And the testes were hard enough to challenge students  but not too hard. It was very interested to take your course.
5,A wonderful teacher. Shes always willing to go out of her way to help whether its on a one to one basis or in a group. Her teaching style is different  but she manages to get you to think independently and question ideas rather than just mindlessly recalling stuff from memorization. Take her class  its worth the work.
5,Ms. Nelson is an excellent teacher. I am taking her for an online and her teaching and instructions are very comprehensive. I would have her as a math teacher over anyone else. She has great character and that says alot about a person.
5,If students have a question  she helps students a lot not only in the class but also in her office. she has lots of enthusiasm to make people to understand  and she gives good grade for tests. Also the style of her teaching makes people more focus on it. therefore  i would like to recommand her.
4.5,True  she has a different style of teaching that can be confusing at first.Tests r hard but is a combination of quizzes and lecture (+ she curves!).She's willing to help alot if asked. She expects you to do outside work and doesn't spoon-feed the answers so you actually understand what you're doing.
1,Absolutely no help at all!! Consistently complains that you should have already learned things in Pre-Calculus and then offers no help to learn these things.
1,what ever the person below said was absolutly right.DO NOT RECOMMEND HER EVER
4.5,Professor Bruce is a great educator. She goes over everything in the book
5,The Perfect Teacher!! I learned alot and she will work with you with whatever you have going on. All around best teacher I have ever had!!
5,Mrs Bruce was a GOOD teacher ever  she is easy. Even though I was a esl student in learning suport but it did not bother her  she always worked with me.
5,I love Mrs. Bruce she is a really great Professor!
3.5,She is very good
5,She is the best! She has a logical style of teaching.
5,She makes you work. If you are serious about becoming a great writer  take her. If not  find a different teacher.
5,Mrs. Bruce is a thorough and helpful teacher. I gained more from her class than I expected to. She is quick witted and can be difficult but will go out of her way to help any student pass or make an A.
5,"oH MY GOD SHE'S DA BOMB! NOT AN EASY A BUT A DEF A! YOU HAVE TO DO THE WORK AND YOU WILL PASS. SHE'S GONNA COME OFF MEAN AS HELL AND A HARD GRADER BUT SHE'S NOT! I SWEAR I KNOW FOR A FACT DIS LADY DONT READ UR ENTIRE PAPER CAUSE AFTER SHE RETURNED MINE WHICH I GOT AN ""A"" ON I FOUND NUMEROUS ERRORS! TAKE HER U WONT REGRET IT!"
4.5,She tries to scare you at first but really eases off at the end of the semester. She gives alot of work but if you turn it in on time you will get a decsent grade. Never had to write so many papers in one class though. Overall I had a great time in her class and she is fair on grades.
5,Very helpful teacher. Teaches a style that will help for years to come. For years writing has not been my thing. She essentially tought a formula for writting essays. I followed it and topped out the Regent's Test. If you research the test in GA you will find a high failure rate amongst even the best colleges. Take her and you won't regret it!
3,definitely difficult to deal with  you'll lose 10 points in each gramatical mistake you make  I am not kidding 10 freaking points!!! she doesn't grade from the scale of 1-10 she grades from A to B no 98 in her class! I don't like her so far but gotta do well. She is good at what she does but tough and condescending enough to ruin it for you.
5,OUTSTANDING INSTRUCTOR!! Very passionate about subject and exhibits strong desire to assist students in becoming sufficient writers. Enthused  understanding  caring and concerned...I suggest she teach teachers how to teach more proficiently!
5,Great instructor....took prior to Regents and she gave a formula that works for any essay and I maxed my score. I have traditionally been a poor writer.
5,She is very helpful  funny  and can dress lol. She makes class fun so the work wont seem like work. She will make sure you learn the material. If you need help she is more than happy to help. Shes great.
4.5,She is a great teacher. the first day she will make is seem like her class will be very hard but its not at all. you will do alot of writing. but she explains what she wants from you clearly and it is easy to understand.if you can write a decent essay you will pass. She tells stories and keeps everyone intrested!! highly recommended!!
2.5,Lots of class discussions
5,I think she is the best professor ever. She really makes writing seem like an art. Her class really prepared me for future writing classes/tests.She is highly reccomended.She has a great personality and keeps the class interested in what she has to say.
5,"Great teacher  like to use ""Scare tactic"" to make you think her class is worst than it is. Alot of paper writting but it helps to learn. Can't wait to take her for 1102 in the Fall of 2007 see you then  Okay....Lol."
4.5,Great teacher  she will make you work for your grade. we ar ehere to learn and she is a wonderful teacher.
4,Knows history and truly enjoys when students are engaged. This can be a really fun class. He talks about his stories and that annoyed some students  but I enjoyed listening to things I never knew about. If you want to learn  listen to what he says. Ask questions! He's very receptive to any questions
2,He is a good guy. I loved him but I couldn't understand his accent. This problem bothered all foreigner students. He takes just two tests  midd term and final and review for tests 2or 3 sessions.
2,This class is good for an easy grade. You don't learn anything. If you are majoring in history  find another professor. You will not learn a thing  but you will get an good grade.
5,This guy is great. I highly recommend Dr Chapman. You must come to class though. He's a fun teacher.
4.5,THE BEST!!!! its the easiest A ever!!!! I love this man!!!!
3.5,If you are just looking for an easy grade  this is your man. However  I was looking for a history teacher and not someone out to push his own political agenda. If I wanted Glenn Beck to teach me history  I would watch more Fox News. I felt this class was an insult to me  my intelligence  and a complete waste of my time.
5,Magnifico Professori!!! Is what he said his name was the first day of class. His class is not hard. Pay attention on Review day for Midterm and you will do well. Same for the final. Its not a very hard class. He presents his information to where its easy to understand.
3.5,Dr. Chapman is a wonderful storyteller  however he impresses his opinions onto the subject matter with a slant towards creationism  specifically Christianity.
4,The course I took with professor Chapman was world history  but was dissapointed that we mostly looked over Greek and Roman history. As for the rest of the world  like Asia  Africa and Americas  we only saw pictures with minimal or no explanation. Very easy class though.
1,i have been at georgia perimeter for the last 2 and half years and i never had such a horrible teacher than dr. chapman. He made us buy a book but we never opened it. Never gave any specific notes and this exams are hard which he doesnt even cover during class. Test are short answers and essays and no study guides. He only has 2 grades so pretty mu
5,"He is a ""professario magnifico ""as he claims.He knows his history so well that he doesn't need notes!U will always learn something new & he keeps u entertained.His jokes r easy 2 laugh at.As long as u take great notes & do your project u will get an EASY A as he gives NO homework!Dr.Chapman gives very direct answers but make sure u speak up. =)"
5,Amazing and funny teacher. Take great note during class and listen what he go over in the review and it lay you an easy A on his final and midterm  and he will curve if nobody did not make an 100.
5,"Professor Chapman is awesome. The stuff flows as if he made history. A little effort will land you at ""A"". Don't miss him."
5,"""PROFESSARIO"" IS AN EXCELLENT HIGHLY EDUCATED MAN. YOU CAN BUY THE TEXT BOOK USED ONLINE LATE EDITION BUT THE BOOK ISNT NECESSARY AS HE IS A WALKING HISTORY TIME BOOK AND INFO IS GIVING BOTH ACCURATELY AND FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE.HE GIVES A REVIEW BEFORE THE TWO EXAMS AND WITH A RECORDER ITS A NO BRAINER. THE PRESENTATION IS EASY YOU PICK THE TOPIC."
5,LWL meaning laughs while learning.He is an excellent teacher. You learn alot and he makes it interesting.
5,Dr. Chapman is an amazing professor! there is only one paper and the midterm and the final. he is absolutely hilarious and he goes over everything you need to know for the final/midterm the week before you take it! best teacher i've had thus far.
5,Dr. Chapman was one of the most interesting teachers I have had at GPC. His lectures are quite interesting and his lifetime experiences and achievements are quite an addition to his classes. He does only offer two tests  but he does his review with the test in his hand. If you pay attention and take proper notes  you will have no trouble passing.
5,DR. CHAPMAN IS A HIGHLY EDUCATED GENTLEMAN. HE KNOWS HISTORY VERY WELL AND TEACHES IT EVEN BETTER. TAKE HIM
4.5,Mr. Chapman is a great teacher  but you have to study for the tests. Take good notes  read the chapters and pay attention in class - easy A. The project is fun (presentation in front of class). He's willing to help any student  he loves history and cares about the students.
5,He is so hilarious. He will have you laughing every class. Tests are hard though. You only get a mid-term and a final  which are half multiple choice and half fill in the blank. Also you have to do a project. You should pass if you take good notes and do the project.
4.5,This guy is a hoot! He seems kinda goofy but he is sharp. Don't argue with him unless you're sure of yourself. On second thought  do try and argue with him
2.5,all you need to do is write 3 papers that have good grammar and punctuation because he is big on that. you have to read all the books.
4.5,First you must understand that philosophy is abstract and personal. (You will discuss virtue and morals.) Only 3 papers and very strict about grammar/punctuation  but if you put thought and effort into your paper  you will do fine! (I got an A on all three.) Fun and interesting teacher.
4,There were only 3 grades - 3 short papers. That's it. Get someone to help edit your paper. Go to class. He will sometimes go over your head but read and write a well written college paper and you are fine. I got an A and it's was pretty easy. Go to the class  write your papers  and read. He is very smart but just listen to him and take some notes
1,I have never been so serious and honest in my entire 23 years on Earth about anything  but I must say that this TEACHER IS THE WORST TEACHER IN HISTORY. He lacks knowledge of this course  he expects us to read and comprehend immediately during new lectures and he refuses to grant you extra credit if you fail poorly on the test. OMG BEWARE PLS!
4.5,great teacher and extremely helpful inside and outside of the classroom.
4,Just REMEMBER read the chapter before class and the cd rom helps I AM SELLING THE TEXTBOOK FOR $50 (sincerelynas@aol.com) He is a great prof. but he tends to forget that his students are not on the same level he is when he is explaining the material. His test are easy b/c the questions come directly from ex. in the book.
4.5,Excellent professor  and you must participate in class and read assigned material.
2,He is a great prof. but he tends to forget that his students are not on the same level he is when he is explaining the material. He does have a personality so the class is boring. His test are easy b/c the questions come directly from ex. in the book. he does not explain the material too well when u ask ?'s he keeps moving leaving you very confused
3,Dr. Brown is BRILLIANT! In fact  he's so brilliant I couldn't understand a word he said. He is VERY nice and tries hard to help. I don't think he understands that most aren't on his level. BE RESPECTFUL and by all means  if you're using Hurleys 9th Ed  go the extra mile and purchase Hurleys 4th ed. solutions manual. He is SOOO funny! Have fun!
1,To all my fellow school mates  for the sake of your sanity DO NOT TAKE 1301 philosophy with this man. He is the most egotistical professor that does not know how to lecture  teach  or comprehend
4,This guy is extremely genius but I came to realize this at the end of the semester. So  just have a positive attitude from the out set and take him with no hesitation. Trust me
5,Very good class. Requires some studying  but questions on test are word-for-word from the book. EASY!
4,He is a good teacher  class is not dat hard. Test are exactly from the exercises and not hard.HE does exercies on the bord  so it is easy.
1.5,Mr. Brown class is somewhat difficult  he does give you 50% of the test up front  but you have to learn the material  which I find hard. He teaches the class as if you are familar with the subject. I think the only one interested is himself. You will have to study hard for his class.
5,Excellent teacher. He is highly recommended.
3.5,Excellent intelligen teacher although His expectations for the papers are unclear and it could be frustrating. Keep a positive attitude and give it a try. He is very nice in grading.Got to Class it will be interesting if you actually read the books assigned.Will Take again if I needed 2.
5,He's very easy  at times it's not required to show up at class  due to the fact the test questions come from the end of each chapter.
1,This teacher is horrible  he cannot make into class on time and then spends the rest of class talking about how he is smarter than all the people he works for.
1,No Comments
4,Overall  a solid professor. Class can be a bit dull  but the professor knows the material well and get it across pretty clearly. Assignments and tests are very fair.
4.5,I am not sure if he is the best professor  but I can definitely recommend him. He makes statistics interesting and easy to understand. I never got bored in his class. Needs to work a bit on pacing the lectures as difficult sections were rushed through....
4,Good teacher. Answers questions. Uses textbook frequently.
4.5,Prof Johnson is a great professor. He tries to make things as easy as possible. Your grade is distributed evenly through exams and homework. He has to work on the pace of his lectures a little  he started out slow and easy  then speeded up a lot at the end when things got more difficult. But it was an easy  enjoyable course overall.
4,Great professor. Very enthusiastic about statistics and very nice to students. Quizzes are easy  midterm and final are a bit difficult  but he's quite lenient in grading.
5,Dr. Johnson has a doctorate in stats. Very knowledgeable  very helpful in explaining  answering questions  and assisting students. His tests are fair if you learn the concepts. He is very enthusiastic about stats and makes the learning pleasurable.
3,nothing great  not hard to get an A   but nothing thrilling.
5,HOTTIE!!! HOTTIE!!! HOTTIE!!! I sat there the entire semester dreaming about him... anyways... stat is easy for me  so that gave me plenty of time to day dream. And i got an A. I'll say it again!!! HOTTIE!!! HOTTIE!!! HOTTIE!!!
5,Great Guy! Genuine! Experienced  knows what he's talking about. Very smart and nice. Tough material if you're not a quantitative mind. Comes highly recommended!
5,Good guy and he can teach the subject  except he doesn't relate the work back to the business world. His assigned homeworks help you study for the tests and there are no surprises on the test.
4,extremely approachable and will admit that stats is not the most interesting subject. however  he's always available in his office and will walk you through any of the material. his exams are tough  but is generous with partial credit.
3.5,No Comments
5,Lots of work!!! Teaches the class like its a math class not like a business class!! I personally was used to the style so thought it was great most of the class felt it was tough... Good Luck!!
4,A nice guy with a dry and sarcastic sense of humor which I liked. He gives you the questions to the quizzes and tests beforehand so you can just do them on your own time with the textbook and then copy them down in class from your notes. Make sure you keep up with the journal questions. If you don't understan your grade he's helpful if you ask.
1,Even if you follow his feedback  it doesn't help future grades. Unnecessarily harsh in general communication. That being said  all work was online  didn't have to go to campus for anything so that's a huge plus. If it weren't for the feedback issues and his attitude toward students  I'd rate higher and consider taking again. Tough but doable.
3,Tons of homework and a fair amount of reading each week. Definitely a harsh grader  but he usually tells you what you're missing. Not the greatest personality  mind  and certainly intimidating  but it's been a year since I've taken his class and the information has actually stuck. Overall - difficult  but worth taking.
1,Never actually explains what he wants. He will fail your assignments and not give clear feedback as to what he actually expects from you. Quiz  2 journals  and groupwork due each week. Rude and extremely unhelpful.
5,Almost finished with my BA in History  I really like to reflect upon my history class with Prof. Timmons. He is tough  but you will rarely find another Prof. as knowledgeable. I would recommend him to anyone who is serious about history or  simply enjoys actual learning and is not afraid to work for it!
2,We had two papers  a podcast to listen and respond to  and reading every week. Told everyone upfront to expect 6 days/3+ hours of work. Gives commentary back for each assignment  however several times I noticed a confusing response and grade and upon reaching out  he got my work confused with another student. You have to be on top of your grades.
5,A pretty dorky teacher  but super nice. His lectures are interesting  however I suggest focusing on the book for tests  quizzes  etc. Open note quizzes and exams. The journal question are rather difficult and can become overwhelming. Overall great teacher + easy class!
3,The lectures are pretty mediocre and there's a heavy workload for a 3 credit hour class. Your final grade is basically how much time you spent outside of class so it's 100% possible to get an A if you're willing to put in the time. If you're not a history buff and just looking to get a gen ed requirement I suggest you look elsewhere
3,Solid professor for the most part. Homework load is insane if you have other heavy courses. If you love to read and write take his class. He can be a bit arrogant at times  but he is very qualified and knows his stuff. Do not fall behind on journal or review question assignments if possible. You will get an A if you work hard for it.
4,His lectures are informational and somewhat interesting  but has a lot of open ended questions and he'll wait until someone answers them. Heavy written homework assignments  but manageable once you get into the swing of things. He makes jokes and isn't too intimidating.
5,good teacher also is willing to help answer questions. fair grader and explains why you missed points. good personality.
3.5,Really tough class. Journal/review questions are lengthy and is more english oriented than history. Do homework everyday  get ahead quick.
3.5,His lecture's aren't terrible so long as someone answers his open ended questions  he'll just stand there until someone does. He's helpful if you have questions but he's a bit odd. The grading isn't bad but the Journal Questions really add up so stay on top of the assignments.
3.5,One of my favorite professors at CState! Highly knowledgable  helpful  friendly  and hilarious. Preparation  homework  and reading are essential. All quizzes/exams are in-class essays  but he gives you the questions ahead of time so you can prepare  and allows you to bring notes to the exam. Take if you want to learn  look elsewhere for an easy A.
5,I would recommend him. Expect homework but it's very manageable. If you do the work you should be able to easily pass. He is upfront about what quizzes are over and midtermsfinal.
1,I took his online class and I'm pretty sure he'll be the toughest teacher I'll ever have. The tests are unbearable. His feedback and instructions are unclear. He expects things he doesn't ask for. The tests are long essays and you only have 1h 20m to write them. I'm not kidding. I don't recommend him at all.
3.5,The workload is a ton. Usually three assignments (which take me a few hours each) per week. On test weeks you have all of those plus an essay test. I don't even know how many days worth of hours I spent preparing for the tests. If you're up for a difficult course  go for it! However  if you have a pretty bulky schedule I would not recommend it.
2,This is class is pretty easy but very boring. His class lectures are pointless and you don't need to take notes because they give you no information needed for exams quizzes.He is a hard grader but i find it hard to believe anyone could fail this class.Everything is out of the books and he lets you do all your work at home prior to exams quizzes.
2.5,I had him for Hist 1112 and actually kinda enjoyed his dry humor. It is a lot of writing however and he definitely has high standards as far as the work load goes but you know what's expected of you and he gives you the exam questions ahead of time. Just try to summarize the answers in your textbook in your own words and you'll be fine.
2,I thought he was a good teacher. Not the most friendly though. Although he is willing to give you many opportunities with late work  despite how intimidating he is in the beginning. His exams are all essays and the grading is NOT easy on them. Make sure you do the quizzes  journals  and discussions to make up for the midterm grades. Make an effort.
2.5,"I can recommend him if you just want to pass. But  if you need to get ""A"" and you are not good at speaking in front of ppl  I won't recommend him. He is tolerant to pass  but intolerant to give ""A"". He is always smiley and looks easy-going  but the professor who needs result  not process. Overall  I like him  but I regret I took his class."
5,where else can you find a teacher like him. He is the best professor i never had before. Please chose him as your professor. He is the best i guarantee.
4.5,I found it rare to find a teacher like Mr. Singleton who truly cared that his students not only did well in class  but also progressed as members of society. He's a wonderful mentor.
5,I loved this teacher! He made the class so interesting and fun. I had NO interest in taking a speech class but it was a requirement  I was so lucky to end up in his class. He really lets you know what he thinks  but in a nice way. The few tests and assignments were easy and FUN. If every instuctor was like him college would be a breeze!!!
5,Gene was an amazingly entertaining teacher. He was light and funny and great to listen to. He was passionate about his subject  and very forgicing of his students. And he's cute as a button!
3,The content covered is very interesting  but the way that she tests you over it is not. Instead of testing over the themes of literature and the impact they had on history  you are expected to be able to identify direct quotes. There were only 4-5 grades for the whole semester and one of those was a group project.
2,Poor grammar for an English teacher. Confusing requirements for grading. Says discussion board is due by 5pm Saturday but also says Students who wait until the last minute to post may find their comments for the week will not reach me before the Board closes resulting in a zero for that week.
5,Took the online US Literature I course. Very well organized  had the entire semester laid out by the first day  which made it easy to plan ahead. Her weekly outlines were a lot of help as she helped break down the assigned readings. I did enjoy being able to pick my own topics for the two essays that were assigned. Dr. Lape is great!
5,I took her online US Literature I course and it was pretty straight forward. Dr. Lape's class is well organized  she grades essays fast  and responds to email in a timely manner. There is a lot of reading (not too much though) but this is a literature course so it's to be expected.
5,American Literature after 1865 is the second of two classes I took with Professor Lape this summer. I greatly enjoyed this class because she helped me grow as a writer. I especially like how she lets students pick the topics of their essays (related to the assigned readings and approved by her). I would reccomend that anyone take a class with her.
5,I took two online classes with Professor Lape this summer  and I wish I could take more. I greatly enjoyed this class covering women's literature. Participation is in the form of Blackboard posts covering that week's readings. Papers are returned (with great feedback) within a few days of submission. I became better writer because of her.
5,Professor Lape has been one of my favorite professors ever. I've taken two courses with her and wish I could take more. She encourages discussion of different view points and is incredibly supportive. The best part is her feedback! Every paper I turn in is returned promptly (which is rare!) with a grade and in depth feedback throughout my paper.
5,Professor Lape is such a sweet lady. She helps you understand the readings the next day you come into class by discussing with everyone. There are not many grades. Attendance does matter to her. There's one group project which could go either way based on the group you choose to be with. The exams are a little rough to study for  but you do well.
5,Absolutely loved this class. The readings were fun and interesting which created great discussions in our discussion board section. Mrs. Lape was a great teacher and always seemed enthusiastic about the different writers and poets we learned about each week. The tests are pretty easy as long as you read the weeklies. She also gives 2 essays.
1,Gives very vague instruction  assigns a ton of reading you'll have to recognize specific quotations from for exams  very unorganized  wish I would have dropped the class.
5,"Online summer class. Syllabus was clear about what was expected. 2 essays and 2 exams throughout the entire semester. Discussion board every week. Professor Lape posts ""weeklies"" which are summaries of the chapters required to be read every week. Gives good feedback on essays. Lots of reading  but easy A if you put in the effort!"
5,It's a lit class so there is obviously a lot of reading. Dr. Lape does a great job of explaining things. She is very easy to get along with. Participation in discussion is required but she welcomes all thoughts and does not put anybody down. She is also funny which makes literature not so boring. Would take another class by her again.
2,I liked the course more than I liked the professor. Professor Lape rarely updated announcements  gave no feedback on anything  was not professional with her email responses  she did not help me much with anything really  and she was too subjective with a lot of things. The class was pretty easy  but she barely did anything all semester!
4,I loved this class. Dr lape does give test but they're easy if you read the readings. I read half the readings and kept up on the weeklies she post which summarized each ready and writer. USE THE WEEKLIES FOR THE TEST!!!!! easy to pass if you can readwrite english.
5,"She is the best teacher I have ever had. She gives you a ton of control over your writing assignments and really wants you to find your own ""writing voice"". I would definitely take any class of hers. I looked forward to English class every week."
3.5,I have taken three of Dr. Lape's classes at CSCC now. She is a wonderful teacher. All of the classes I have taken have been online  and Dr. Lape makes instructions clear. She grades fairly and offers wonderful feedback on papers. I highly recommend her classes. I am an English major  and her classes have deepened my love of literature. Top Notch!
3,Lets see. for this online class she has made us read about 5-10 different small readings per week and then.... 60% is knowing small quotes from all the readings over the past 8 weeks. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? She is a critical grader and unorganized. I'm sure she's nice in person but don't take online unless it's the only class you take. Ridiculous.
5,Great Instructor!! Clear with directions  answers emails quickly & grades quickly as well. She gives feedback on the graded papers in the side notes which were very helpful! The papers assigned were interesting! She's a great instructor! I would definitely take again! Do the work & read the assigned readings to help w/ writing & you'll get an A/B!
2,I would not recommend Professor Lape to people looking to take an online English course. I'm not sure how she is in a classroom  but online she was confusing  unorganized  late giving back graded assignments  and she did not respond to emails. Better off to just take her in an actual classroom or not at all.
5,Dr. Lape is absolutely the best instructor I have ever had. I have had the pleasure of having her for a total of three classes. She is upbeat  informative complimentary and always gives her students positive feedback. I took English 2276 on-line  a lot of reading and writing but well worth it. She prepares you for the professional world.
2.5,No Comments
2,The class was boring as hell  I got an A and I have no clue how. She is just a terrible teacher.
4.5,Easy Teacher  Easy Grader  Plays Favorites  so (at least pretend to) pay attention in class  and at least once see her in her office.
3,No Comments
4,easy grader
1,horrible teacher. didnt really teach anything. repeats herself often. tells crazy stories unrelated to class. gave term paper and didnt explain any of it. dont recomend taking her class
5,She is one of the best teachers I have ever had. She got me interested in Economics and now it is my second major.
3.5,Decent teacher  and really nice to look at. She's a little bit loopy though
4.5,VERY attractive. It's almost distracting. Helpful and good professor.
4.5,She is very helpful  and seems genuinely want her students to understand the material. As long as you pay attention during lecture  the tests aren't too difficult. Besides  she's relatively funny and is one of the best looking teachers I've had here.
5,Good class. Esp. the lab.
4,Easy course. I love graphs.
2,Nice lady but bad teacher. Does not focus enough on topics that are important for the test. Loves graphs that are not a big part of test and test are very tricky.
5,She is very helpful and a very nice person
4,Good teacher. A little unstructured in the lectures but much could be gotten from the class. Always willing to help. Funny.
4.5,She went out of her way to help me when I was having troubles with the class. Great Teacher
3,The class is a hard class compared to other economics instructors that I hear about. The test are really hard and very  very tricky. You have really  really memorize and understand the concepts.
4,The only thing that I would change about the class is format of the tests. She uses too many mc questions that are worth too much of the grade. It would be easier to study if there were a matching or short answer section. partial credit?
4.5,First off: one of the most attracive instructors here :) She doesn't have THAT bad of an accent  I can understand her fine. Class is easy as long as you follow what she teaches. Use study guides and take notes during class and you'll be fine.
2.5,Needs a more focused lecture and more emphasis on concepts nad terms that ae used and less graphs that don't mean much with no concepts.
5,Dr. Perkins is the best professor I have had at ACU. I am currently a MAcc student and he still goes back and reviews the basics with us. He believes strongly in understanding the fundamentals of accounting. His class is not hard if you pay attention in class and do the homework. He also makes himself very available to his students.
5,In order to succeed in this class  you must do the homework and read the chapters (at least glance the vocabulary). The exams are exactly like the study guides he gives with a few tricky/thinking questions. He also provides tutoring sessions in case a student has trouble in this class.
4,Great teacher! Helps get one into the understanding of accounting easily. In order to succeed  you must do the homework although it is not mandatory.
4,Great person
4.5,Fantastic guy and great christian. the material that he teaches might not be the easiest but he will make sure you get through it if you try and show up to class.
4,This class is extremely straight forward. Dr. Perkins literally wrote the book for this class. This means do what he says  and you will make an A. Unfortunately  he asks a lot with homework assignments nearly every class. However  if you just put a little bit of time into the class throughout the semester  it will be one of your easiest classes.
4,Perkins is friendly  and will certainly help you understand the material - he actually wrote the course textbook  so the course is very consistent. The work itself is very difficult  and requires an immense amount of practicememorization to master. Makes you realize the level of commitment required to go into accounting  though.
3,This class is not as easy as he comes across like it is. Study all material before test. Good guy though
5,good man.
5,Cool guy  easy class but you learn a lot. Loved it.
5,"Awesome dude! Yes  he will drop the ""I really like what the author did here"" joke 100 times. No  it does not get old."
5,Very good teacher. He teaches everything very clearly and step by step to make sure you understand it.
5,Dr. Perkins was great in this course and helped convince me to become an accounting major. He expects a lot of each student  but is not unreasonable. All the answers to the homework are online  so it's a relatively easy course
5,"GREAT professor who is SO knowledgable about accounting. He always makes sure students understand new concepts before moving on and is very helpful. This is not an ""easy A"" type of course  but as long as you keep up with homework and reading you can get an A."
4,Good professor
5,Perkins is the sweetest man ever! He explains concepts throughly and is always happy to answer questions. The homework answers are posted online and the tests are just like the reviews he gives and goes over in class. Def take his class if you get the chance!
4,did not understand well the class because of the language  but what he talked in class was not hard. the test is not difficult if u do homework even for international students
4,Very clear and helpful. Gives homework answers daily to check work. Very applicable teaching style
3,David Perkins is a good teacher. He cares about his students  and is available for help whenever you need him.
4.5,No Comments
3,I agree with the person who said he was stylish! Great professor  knows his stuff. OMG though: HARDEST CHEG CLASS IN THE CURRICULUM. make sure you go to class and have fun with the final. i still have nightmares...lol
4.5,Great teacher  the class itself is not so great. Very organized  stylish guy  explains things really well. Work load tends to be needlessly heavy  and he's gone for half the semester. Teacher is good  the class itself sucks.
2,He is always ahead in lectures so you can easily lose track of the material. He is completely disrespectful when answering your questions.
5,It's been a couple of years I took this class from this professor. He was the best teacher in the CHEG department  and the best teacher I had at UD. I strongly recommend him.
5,yeah hes ok
5,I also agree that he is one of the best cheg professors in the department. I love that not only is he knowledged in the material but that he can actually get his point across clearly (versus some other cheg professors...). Every class was exciting in some way. Oh  and the best dresser. :o)
5,Best professor i've ever had. The only class i've stayed awake in and actually gone to regularly. He is also very friendly outside class and has the coolest accent.
5,Best professor I have ever had here. He should teach the rest of the professors in the engineering department how to lecture.
3,He is good at teaching.. but speeds through material too fast  and assigns 100s of pages of readings to fill in the gaps (which don't help on tests). Subject isn't interesting. Looks/Sounds like the Red Stripe guy in the commercials
5,No Comments
2.5,Kinda cute but boring as all hell. Slept in his class regularly. Hard class and hard grader. I'd avoid.
5,He is a really smart guy
3.5,Took it as a summer class and found it fair. In each non-exam day we took a quiz (found online) that was easy to get 100 in. 3 exams were fair & non-****ulative. The only sucky thing... he kept us the entire 3 & 1/2 hours each day. We did watch some experiments so the time went by quickly. No point in takin notes b/c he everything is from the book.
2,He's extremly boring  hopefully he'll get better with age. His tests are super hard  i see this a trend in the psych dept. The person under me mustve been in my class cause he really did say that! His grading system is the only thing that helped anyone pass the freakin class  avoid at all costs!
1,"He doesn't give enough time to write down the slides but refuses to put them up on blackboard b/c of he's ""not sure of copyright laws"".. he makes things so much more complex than they need to be  and his combover distracts the whole class. Read the book and u'll do fine."
1,I agreed with the person before me. In Dr. Hanson's stats class  it is much easier. You don't have a lab  and instead you have to do 17 online modules. He only had 2 exams  and were 25 multiple choice and open book.
1,Took him for Statistical Methods and he was horrible. We had a total of 4 tests and 6 lab quizes. If it was not for me getting straight A's in all my quizes in the lab portion of the class  I would have failed. Lecture and Lab are each worth 50%. I came away w/ a C+  but failed every lecture test. Stay away!!!! Take Prof. Hanson instead....
2.5,He is absolutely borring!!! I had him for forensic psych and he is borring and hard. Plus he is a weird professor. I DO NOT recommend him!
3.5,You will not get a good grade if you do not read the book. His lectures make sense however the test covers much more material and in more detail than what he covers in class. Test do come off a bit confusing if you do not know the material. Not an easy A class  however you can pass without ever attending. Read the book and you will do well.
3.5,As previously stated  he is very intelligent  and challenges ppl intellectually. However  because he is so intelligent  he makes things more complex than they have to be. I do recommend him if you are into thinking and intellecutal growth. If you are just up to getting easy A's  then avoid him at all costs.
4,He is excellent. Teaches on a college level. Not out to hold your hand but interested in seeing you be successful and is patient and helpful. His exams are tough. You have to read any text he uses. Would take his class again for his interesting methods in teaching. Very intelligent.
2,had him for forensic psych class  absolutely worst professor EVER!!! do urself a favor and do not waste time signing up 4 his class his exams r ridiculous and so are his teaching skills. he sux ass and needs to get another hobby
3,He does know he stuff however when you think you have the hang of it he makes it confusing. He tests are very detail and often difficult. Not an easy class at all. He is nice and tries to help but his test are what kills your grade.
2.5,tough teacher. very 'nit-picky' when grading papers. must follow structure when composing an essay. read the material.
4.5,Good professor  I personally liked his method of teaching. People complaint about having to read the book but come on  this IS COLLEGE  you are expected to read the book.
1,boring professor who gives out tricky exams  and his grading system is unfair. his definition of a curve is rounding 79.5 to 80.
1,i have to agree with the people who wrote before me. szura is definitely a jerk! in last semester's class  no one had a 90 average. he said the top 4 students were going to get A's. i was in the 4th spot  but he gave me a B+. i will never forget what he did to my psychology GPA. it went from a perfect 4 to a 3.95 because of his unfair grading!
1,don't let his appearance fool you! he may look like a nice guy  but his exams are very tricky. I knew the book inside out  but ended up only with a B. Highly not recommended!
1.5,this guy sucks. he reads off some powerpoint slides he has but he tests u on the whole book and then picks the most random stuff to test you on... he is def not easy and is extremely boring
1.5,he sucks! his exams are very difficult and not clear. i took his class because of this website- what a mistake! if you want to study 100pg. of the textbook for his exams  then good  take him  but i would not recomend it!
5,He makesaid class time highly amusing  and he is very knowledgeable in the subject area.
4,Honestly  Professor Cawley is a really great professor. However  in SAGES the prompts for his papers can be a bit unclear and the grading criteria aren't exactly made clear.
4.5,By far my favorite Case professor. Very prone to tangents relating concepts to real-life problems. When he first starts explaining a concept  it seems a little circuitous  but when he finishes his derivations it's crystal clear what he was going for. Absolutely brilliant  and always loves talking to students in his spare time.
4,James is a really nice guy who really likes tables. That said he is a decent prof  class attendance definitely isn't mandatory  and he teaches almost straight from the book and is very clear about what will be on exams. He had some cute in class experiments too. All around definitely a good engr 225 prof.
4.5,Cawley is a really good professor that knows the material inside and out. He is always available  and very understanding of students. The exams are not easy  but that doesnt mean it is impossible to get an A. Know concepts  not formulas  read the book  and pay attention to his in-class examples. Go talk to him too during office hours!
3.5,He definitely didn't have a clue about how to teach a SAGES seminar  even though you could tell he tried hard. He graded papers very oddly and seemed to be evaluating them as if they were scientific journal articles  which they certainly were not. He was a nice guy but many people in the class felt they came away shortchanged.
4.5,Excellent advisor. Mediocre teacher.
3.5,While this may have been one of the most boring and dry classes I've ever had  I did learn a lot from him. It's very concept-oriented  which I guess you either love or hate. And man  he loves those steam tables a little too much.
3,He is alrite  but since I was not interested at all in the subject material I was generally bored. Tests have a lot of multiple choice questions and short answer questions  so it is not just solving problems.
3,Extremely boring and dry. Period.
4,Theres really nothing wrong with him. He does teach concepts  not plug-and-chug. You can get an A if you just know 2 of formulas covered going in to the exam. He has a lot of cool demonstrations and relates material to real life situations that he uses his free time researching for us.
4,Focuses much more on knowledge of concepts then on formulas  which can be a refreshing change. Course feels more like an engineering course then most other ENGR courses. Can wander off topic in lectures though  and man does he Love those steam charts.
2,No Comments
2,Tests don't utilize formulas or reflect the homework at all.
4.5,you actually have to know the subject to do well in this class  which frustrates most people. be prepared to LEARN about fluid flow  heat transfer  etc. and not just how to plug-n-chug
2.5,He may know the material but he is not very good at communicating it to the class. The lectures are unorganized  often off the subject. The tests are written on the fly  and often contain too many real-world examples that are impossible to solve.TAs great
3,Not bad  even though I did not like the course material.
1,No Comments
2,I've actually logically proved his lectures to be a waste of my time  along with another student. TA's pretty helpful  tests follow homework and the book.
3,Marks too hard...no fair
2,He's certainly got little patience outside of class and isn't very accessible in general  but if you do the readings and come to class you can get by easily.
1,Was pretty psyched to take a class on comics  and although the material was cool and interesting  the experience overall was destroyed by the prof's arrogance. He needs to turn down the bravado big time  and come down to earth with the rest of us--he is such a turn off OMG!
1,Found this professor to be pretty mediocre. Lectures were a sleep fest consisting mostly of the prof ranting about irrelevant things. Watch out if you disagree with his opinions cause it will cost you.
1,Really disengaged prof. He's got high regard for his own ideas  but little time and patience for anyone who disagrees with him. Shows very little interest in student success  and does not make himself (or his TA's) accessible for any kind of assistance outside of lecture. Acts like he doesn't want to be there  and really couldn't care less.
1,Awful professor. He uses his lectures as a soapbox for his political views which have nothing to do with the course. His expectations on tests/assignments are very unclear  and he offers no help whatsoever. His essay questions are impossibly hard  and when you ask for help he rolls his eyes at you like he can't be bothered. Worst prof ever!
1,Prof. Lesk is the most uncaring  arrogant prof I have ever encountered. He ALWAYS thinks he is right  and will give you a bad grade if you disagree with his opinions on assignments/tests no matter how well supported. His lectures are banal and insights shallow. His classes are a waste of time and money.
2,Very very specific about what he wants out of your assignments. Needs you to pander to his own views to do well in the class  leaving not much room for originality and outside perspectives.
1,I was excited to take his Sex in the City one program  and the first term was okay  but the second he just piggy backed off of the other one program profs  and had very little to do with sexual diversity. He doesn't care for his students' opinions or mental health  and though some of the readings and trips were good  an overall disappointment.
1,The worst professor I've ever come across in my years at U of T. I would give him a 0/5 but it is not possible. Right from the get go  his ego is apparent. He does what suits him  and to heck about anyone else because of course the universe revolves around him. He's sad and I pity him. Save your money and time  and take a course with a better prof.
5,The 199 courses are great for breath requirements  and this course was no exception. It was a very fun course. There were only a few papers and one take home test. As long as you gave a solid effort on each assignment it was not hard to get a high mark. The material of the course is also very eye opening.
1,Really arrogant  and just annoying. Really easy to get a good grade even though he's nit-picky.
5,Really open to student's ideas  even when he didn't agree with them he accepted their merit. Really funny and used real world connections to make class interesting.
4,I LOVED Lesk's sex in the city class- would highly recommend this first year seminar. The material and field trips were very interesting and Lesk clearly knew a lot about the subject matter and added a lot to the overall experience. Sometimes it was hard to tell what kind of mood he was in which was scary  but for the most part he's a fun prof.
2,A few of us are currently having a study group for this class right now for the final exam. The problem we've noticed in the midterm is that even though our arguments are fully supported  which fulfills the requirement of a good essay/short answer  as long as he doesn't agree with your opinion  he will dispute the answer and give it a bad grade.
1.5,He is very opinionated and arrogant. His ego is through the roof.
2,I was very excited to take this course  as I'm new to the city and very interested in Sexual Diversity Studies. However  I find the course to often be a waste of time  unless we are on a field trip or there is a guest speaker. The assignments feel like busywork  and I find Prof. Lesk comes off as very arrogant  especially towards guests.
1,"The worst! Anything that contradicts his argument he dismisses as ""it doesn't matter cause it's just comics"" THEN WHY ARE YOU TEACHING A COURSE ON THEM? In one class a girl called him out on taking a quote out of context  his response: ""I know but it's so much more delicious this way."" Great reading list but that's all. AVOID HIM LIKE THE PLAGUE!!"
3.5,The only way the professor grades you is essays  A LOT OF ESSAYS. Write 3 essays in two hours in class...
1,Hes boring
4,Prof Lesk is an amazing speaker. His lectures are clear  concise  and very interesting. He grades fairly  but not too rough. I think the negative feedback for him on here must mostly be from people who didn't do their readings and consequently got poor marks. He doesn't put up with offensive opinions  but encourages discussion.
5,Great guy and professor. Alot of work but if you do it you will do well in the course.

5,Man  Van Cleave is the greatest professor. He's an extremely nice and laid back guy who will let you know exactly what's expected. THe class work really isn't difficult  but it does require a lot of creative thought which is way more enjoyable than the garbage you have to do in other classess. This class was the Oasis of my semester.

5,Ryan has a way of teaching that is just right for the English department. His students thrive in the environment  and the material put out is better because of his influence. A great guy  wonderful professor  I highly recommend Van Cleave.
5,He made himself very clear in what he expected. He allowed the students to have a say in what was done in class and he helped keep me interesting...something very hard to do in english.
5,Vancleave is the man. I took him for a summer class and he is very fun. He knows what's going on in the world and you have a chance for just random talks. Take him if you can but be sure to read the stories. You will discuss them each day in class and he will give you a grade on participation.
5,No Comments
5,Best english teacher I've ever had. All you have to do is keep up with the short story assignments and you will get an A. You have a quiz about once a week on the stories you read--nothing tricky  just the basics. Take him if you can.
5,Ryan brings a positve attitude to class everyday and makes poetry enjoyable  let alone tolerable. He cares about what we have to say and gives us an opportunity to say it. www.ryangvancleave.com
4,Overall a great prof. Super smart  knowledgeable on a wide spectrum of issues. Fastidiously organized- has about a 20 page syllabus. Always willing to help  but can be kind of dense. Very fair. Midterm= easy. Papers= several  short. Final= powerpoint presentation. Take her  she's worth the work.
1,I hated this class. It was so pointless and she often contradicted herself  and the TA gave conflicting information. The midterm was easy  but the papers are so ambiguous even with her verbose notes in the syllabus and on handouts. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
5,She is a challenging professor but is incredibly organized and one of the best professors at AU. If you have questions  you have to go to her but then she will do everything she can to help you work out the question. If you want an easy A  this isn't the class for you. But if you truly want to learn how think and create an RD  she's one of the best
4.5,Wonderful professor. Truly insightful on Russian politics and society. I learned an incredible amount on the subject
2,I learned a lot in her class  but it was very difficult and she was often unclear about instructions. i had to check out books from the library on my own to do her papers. pick someone else
2,She was much better than i expected. you must do the reading and study hard  but it will pay off. it is not a class you can slack off in and still get a good grade. but if you do the work you will get a good one AND actually learn a lot. Much happier with this class than anticipated
5,An excellent professor. Very organized  assigns helpful materials and papers. She has high standards and the material is tough  but that's not a bad thing at all. This class will give you a real challenge and teach you some very useful things - just be willing to put in some effort. IR Research was my most stressful class  but also my favorite.
1,this rating serves to confirm the evaluations of others. it doesnt matter how well you've done in other classes  how high your gpa is  or how much research you've done before. THIS CLASS WILL BE USELESS and ANNOYING. Don't take it. Wait another semester and take it with someone else. She is the worst professor I have ever had.

2.5,WORST. PROFESSOR. OF. ALL. TIME.
1,Trust me on this: DO NOT take this woman for this class. Without a doubt the worst experience of my academic career. You've been warned.
1.5,Do not have her as a professor. She expects yout to know everything with no explanation as to why or its purpose. The papers were confusing and unclear at best. The final was impossible and pointless unless you wrote down every single word she said throught the semester. Avoid at all costs.
2,this class was hell on earth. two major papers -- she outlines them but i still didnt know what she wanted from it. then theres the final where you basically have to know everything about anything -- very stressful class
2,HORRIBLE do NOT take this class. unclear  very boring. horrible class.
1,Is not clear on anything until after it is all done with
1.5,Extremely difficult...two major research papers to do in this class  and she won't explain how to do it until after it's done  at which point you've already received a bad grade.
4.5,Mark is one of the most influential Professors I have ever had. I look up to him as a father figure. He is extremely knowledgeable and wise. Very traditional and passionate at what he does.
5,Love Mark! My favorite teacher by far. As long as you are good (which  if you aren't  why are you an art major?) you'll be fine. Highly recommended!
4,I think Mark assumes that art students are here to paint/draw/whatever our asses off. Isn't that what you're here for? I don't know you tell me. Mark is the best professor I've had in the department. Positive  open-minded and helpful. He's pretty old school but he is extremely knowledgeable. If he doesn't like you... you must suck. Sorry.
5,Best class yet at SSU. I can see the results of his teaching in my work and in all of my classmates- everyone has moved a big leap forward. Easy personality  knows his stuff.
2.5,discouraging at times
4,Mark does expect a lot out of his students but he just wants you to succeed. He's always there to help and you can learn a lot from him if you choose to. DO NOT take this class unless you are interested in painting and have done it before! Even though the class was hard and time-consuming  it was definitely the best class I've taken at SSU.
4.5,His class was very laid back. You go in and get to listen to headphones  paint  have fun with it. After each piece  you put them up and as a class  discuss each one. Sometimes a bit harsh if he doesnt like your work. If you love art  take the class. Its fun  relaxed  and Mark is honest. Take the class  its a nice break from other classes!
4.5,Mark is a good professor. He really teaches his classes as opposed to just sitting back. I feel I'm learning a lot more in Int. than I did in beginning w/a different professor.
3.5,With a habit of cutting to the quick  he does expect abit much from the beginners  but once you give him time and work with him one on one his methods become a bit clearer and his advice becomes much more sound. A special study course with him would be the best bet for truly gaining from his teachings.
1,commented more about the materials i was using than my ability or the piece i was working on. an elitest who places too much importance upon the more trivial parts of artwork (i.e. stretcher bar width or acrylics vs. oils) and not enough on the actual artwork itself. not a very encouraging professor.
3.5,mark is a very good teacher  he may be disparaging about a students work but his feedback is  though sometimes harsh  is usually right on the money. has high expectations but often helps students achieve thouse expectations
2.5,"taking a class with mark is like baiting a wild bear  i wouldnt recommend either. prone to fits of rage and disparaging comments. hard grader. just tells you what to paint..and skips the whole ""how its done"" part"
3.5,agree  has expectations of advanced painting for beginners class. doesn't like things painted in pastels. Likes a specific style of painting. if you arent satisfied with a grade he gives you a chance to improve your painting  thats nice.
2.5,Grades beginning classes with expectations of advanced  very discouraging feedback.
5,Best Spanish professor I've had. She loves her students  keeps the class entertained  and is a wonderful teacher!!
5,professor felt is a wonderful teacher. Had her for 201. Tests are really easy and she will explain stuff to you if you don't understand. TAKE HER!!
5,Felt is a wonderful teacher and woman. If I could have her as my professor for all subjects I would definately do it. She gives just the right amount of work and always teaches the subject matter before assigning anything. She's terrific. I highly recommend her!
4.5,She is amazing. She really knows her subject matter  which can make or break a language class. Dont take any other teacher! Use the book all the time  get tutor if needed LSS. Study frequently. a few pop quizzes-she warns you. Do all your work including charla and lab minutes. Great communication of knowledge.
5,oh felt. i just love her. she is supper sweet and definitely wants her students to do well. sentence translations on tests  but she gives practice ones ahead of time. not a lot of HW  just a workbook that comes with an answer key. 3 or 4 oral presentations  but they're pretty easy and she isn't a hard grader. take it with her if you can.
5,amazing. super organized! always available when help is needed  and very good with email.
3.5,Very good professor. Explains everything well. IF you need help  she will do well at making you understand the concept. Spanish lab sucks  but you have to do it. Overall  pretty amazing.
5,Amazing professor. Very thorough. I would love to take more classes from her
5,PROFESORA FELT ROCKS! She has been one of my favorite professors since my attendance at Sonoma. She really wants her students to learn the spanish language but also the latin american culture. I would most definitely suggest to take her class.
3.5,she was very sweet and would help you if you needed it  but her tests were very hard almost all sentence translation! so if you arnt good at that then dont take this class!
4,pretty easy class  some busy work  but not alot. just go to class and do what they tell ya and you'll be fine
5,Professor Felt is a great spanish professor. She makes every class meeting and every second of class fun  and she WILL teach you spanish! Highly recommended.
5,absolutely loved every second of her class...if i could i would take her for every unit of college PERIOD!! profesora felt rocks
5,I loved her! She is very patient and willing to go a bit off topic (as long as it's in Spanish). She is awesome!
4.5,She is fun  clear  and makes spanish fun. If you need help she is always there for you. What a sweet woman. I hope she doenst get murdered by the ghost of Prez Nixon..boo!
5,My favorite profesora in college so far!!!
3,Well I found her class difficult  she was always out sick  and she wasn't very clear  and she ran class badly.
4,Good teacher. Might not be around very long though  I hear she's going to be murdered by the ghost of President Nixon.
5,I learned a lot from this class  Joan is very pleasant and really wants her students to do well.
4.5,She's very enthusiastic. She really wants you to learn this stuff  so that makes it that much better if you're in the class.
1,This course is a self-discovery course  so you would imagine for it to involve some degree of creativity. She claims to encourage creativity  but the truth is that she puts countless restrictions to what you can do in your work. During lecture  she says the same thing about ten times over  and she leaves little room for actual artistic work. So ugh
5,Geri is a very nice  down to earth prof  like a sweet grandma. There is definitely a lot of work to do  but she grades easy  as long as you do it & show a little effort you'll do fine. She's a little unorganized at times. Failed to mention in syllabus/class there was a 10 page final memoir paper. Lots of small group sharing. Fun  artsy class!
4,She's sweet and cares deeply for her students. Class focused on art therapy so be prepared to do creative things in an art journal. Doesn't grade based on artistic ability (just make sure you meet the criteria explained in syllabus). Takes a while to get papers back  but is a generous grader SINCE prompts are vague
2,She's really sweet  but you won't get your assignments back for months most of the time. There's no tests or anything  but several papers  projects  a 40 page written/artwork journal  and a final 10 page paper complete with an art project. She's incredibly forgetful and often assigns things at the last minute and provides minimal instructions.
3.5,She's an interesting professor. Really nice  maybe a little strange at times  but super down to earth. I like the type of work that we do. It's an interesting class  a lot of work with personal life stuff  but you don't necessarily need to share. Lots of creative writing stuff and you keep a dream journal. A few small projects too
5,The personality class was great. It's not hard if you do the work. The study guides make it so you know what's expected for the test. She's clear about what she wants. The presentations you have a lot of freedom on  which I liked  as with the final paper. It's not vague  you just have a lot of options. She's very helpful  lends books  and is nice!
1,I would not recommend her. She rambles incoherently  is unprofessional  disorganized  and condescending on top of all that. She is not motivating or inspiring..she is depressing. Definitely not worth the time or money.
5,I think she's great. If you are creative  enjoy arts and crafts  don't mind doing some self exploration  prefer hands on work and don't like multiple choice tests  this is the class for you.
4.5,I loved her energy! Personally  I loved using creativity in journaling. She was approachable and great!
3.5,I really enjoyed her class. I loved making the journals and the autobiographical writing combined with art. So if you like that type of thing the class is great! But at parts of the class things did get really repetitive and she had a problem with changing assignments last minute after I'd already completed things  which is uncool.
2,SHE IS AMAZING AND SO SO NICE. ALMOST EVERYONE GETS AN A IN HER CLASS  LITERALLY. VERY EASY TEACHER. YOU WOULD BE STUPID NOT TO TAKE CLASSES WITH HER.
5,Geri's classes are very experiential. DO not take this class if you want lecture and tests and very specific information. DO take this class if you want to get out of the class what you put into it. Very hands on with arts and creativity. Keep an open mind. I think younger people may get less from her because learning from her is experiencial.
1,AWFUL! all you will do is collage and talk about feelings with people you dont know. goodness. i will not ever take a class from her again. shes very unclear about assignments and will never give you a straight answer. STAY AWAY!
1,I will never take her again. In addition to the previous commenter's accurate complaints  she picks favorites  and if she doesn't like you - good luck!
3,Over the course of the semester this class has turned more into an art class than a psychology class. Sometimes I feel like she is talking down to us and is pretty set in her own way of doing things. I recomend this class for those of you who are more serious about art and enjoy service learning with children.
2.5,Runs around like a chicken w/its head cut off.
5,Very easy- hit the pub before class  then talk about your feelings-- way to get an A!
1,A Kindergarten teacher with a profesor's badge
5,I took her in the summer and i loved this class! she is such a great teacher. i had this class for 4 hours and she made it fly bye. she has a way of breaking up the class that makes it bearable.
4,Sweet lady. Lots of videos and some art stuff. Mostly reading from the text and lectures with some group work. She assigns a few short  easy papers. She's good for GE.
4.5,Very great professor. I had her for two classes and she mentored me for my student teaching. Yes  she does get off topic but she has great stories and so much knowledge regarding special needs students. Her class required writing of reflections for each class.
4,I loved Dr. Renick-Wood's class! She is so personable and knowledgeable about children with special needs. She has the greatest stories and makes class so interesting! She is funny and she also doesn't keep you in class for the whole 4 hours like some professors do. She does require alot of reflections but I least learned something in the process!
3.5,I loved the class because Dr. Wood's stories/experiences were soooo interesting!! She made us all laugh all of the time! She is very flexible and understanding if you are having any personal issues and need to extend an assignments due date by a week. She offered to print extra PowerPoints for us if we needed them.Language Module was unclear though
2.5,Very scattered...epitomizes the absent minded professor. Often repeats herself and weekly lesson due to be unorganized. Way too much busy work for graduate school!r I have a problem with everyone getting an A if they do the work. I worry about the number of grad students being turned out with poor grammar and writing skills barely comparable to h
3.5,Dr. Renick has a tendancy to venture off topic  but if you truly listen to her lectures  you will find that she is an incredibly intelligent professor. She's not the typical egocentric prof  for her life experiences allow her to function on a realistic level while maintaining a solid intellectual foundation.
2.5,The class is a ton of work with a lot of reading and the lectures are kind of boring. If you put some effort into the class you'll do fine. Just try to get on her good side! She can be kind of spacey and forgetful at times  but not a bad person!
4.5,Lots of experiance
2.5,She gave too much busy work. Her stories were more insightful than anything in the text.
1,This is the worst professor! Lost my portfolio! Gave me a B in the class for no reason--I haven't had a B since my freshman year...
1,The MOST unprofessional professor I've ever had the misfortune to encounter!
1,Has missed 2 classes
5,Tells great stories! They are more insightful than anything I learned for the text.
1,Dr. Renick has a strict attendance policy  but misses classes regularly herself. In addition  she is never in her office during her scheduled office hours.
5,Dr. Renick is the best professor. She knows her subject and explains everything very well. Very fair...
4,Knows her topic. The best.
1.5,Very unclear about her expectations of assignments and rambles on in class never coming to a point. Her helper that came to class had to interpret everything after Burga said it.
3.5,SNORE. Explains assignments better after you get them back covered in red ped  but is definitely willing to accept revisions.
2,All i have to say is good luck staying awake
5,In tune with her topic. Great expeditor.
5,Easiest class I've ever taken. Easy A! She's a good professor too.
5,She is the sweetest woman who really understands her students and gets that not everyone is interested in sociology but has to take it to graduate. She's easy going and she will work with you as long as you communicate with her. She knows her stuff and she explains it well. She has her own ideas but genuinely hears her students out. Take her!
5,Great professor! I took the class online and she was very clear on all assignments. She was quick to respond to e-mails and provided feedback on assignments. Easy 'A' if you do the work.
5,Took her online. Very easy class and as long as you participate you are golden. The only problem I really had was the discussion boards because it seemed that she just gave you whatever she felt she wanted to at the time. It worked out for me though. She usually quick to respond if I had a question. Overall  I say definitely take her.
5,I took this class in the fall last year and I am looking forward to taking her online this fall. She is awesome! She genuinely cares about her students and is always available and willing to help!
4,Took this class online. Not a lot of points taken so you have to keep up with your work. Read a chapter  post on discussion board come back 2 or 3 times after that to get the full 15 points for the week along with 5 points of that being just an opinion you submit to her. One research paper  midterm and final. Not too difficult. Interesting class!
5,GREAT TEACHER!! I TOOK THIS CLASS ONLINE. HARDESTY GIVES LOTS OF EXTRA CREDIT AND IS VERY HELPFUL! I PLAN ON TAKING HER FOR SOC 235.
5,Ms. Hardesty is AWESOME! This class is a breeze and the only really big assignment is the group project. Other than that it is notes and tests! She is so nice and helpful! She is hilarious also. She hardly ever has class on Friday!
5,She is one of my favorite professors. She is easy going  amusing  super nice and her classes are not very hard. If you show up and listen to the lecture you will pass this class. She gives study guides and spends a day reviewing before the tests. She shows videos sometimes and allows for some class time to work on the one project she assigns.
5,really easy to get along with  tests are super easy she gives study guides  she will clarify anything you want to know watch movies alot  and she keeps the class intresting  and takes attendence sometimes
5,take this teacher! She is really great  she makes a dull subject interesting. Take good notes and the tests will be no problem  I did not even open my text book  she gives reviews of everything on the test. Take this teacher for Soc!
5,she is super sweet and is very willing to work with you! great class!
5,Sweetest woman on earth. super easy class.
4,It is a pretty easy class. She gives you exactly what you need to know on the tests. As long as you attend class and take good notes you will pass the class.
4.5,shes easy and funny. definitely reccomend
4.5,Great teacher! Very funny and easy to talk to. I have her for SOC 131 right now. You don't need a book  unless you want to read more in detail  otherwise she writes everything you need to know on the board. She takes attendance randomly  but if you don't go to class  you won't get the notes anyway.
4,Professor Hardesty is a really easy professor. She is easy to understand  she doesn't require you to get a textbook  and she cracks some pretty funny jokes. I took this class as a Gened  and now I think sociology is great.
5,Hardesty is funny and her classes are straightforward and to the point. Write down what she writes down and you will ace the tests. I never studied and I am getting an A. If you can relate to the material or memorize  you will do well. You don?t need a book  well I didn?t use one.
4.5,don't bother with the book  you won't use it. everything you need to know is given in lecture and written on the board. Very easy class  IF you take notes! easy to talk to  answers questions  willing to help you.
1.5,"I didn't think she was a good professor at ALL. She didn't help you out what so ever..and she says ""ummm"" WAYYY too much  which makes you not be able to stand her for too long. DONT TAKE HER."
5,Used Point System. To get an A we needed 320 ptS  she offered 710 pts. 2 tests and must get 50% to consider getting A. No final. Small quizzes in between (not required but if you want pts then take it) You can fail the quizzes and it wont matter bc its point based. Posts PPT lectures after class. I did so much extra work than I needed to.
5,Very passionate about what she teaches. Have to buy TopHat for participation. Point Based System. To get an A you have to get 340 points  she offered 860 points! Her quizzes are online but very short. 10questions in 8mins so no time to use book/notes. Very easy to get A if you just PAY ATTENTION.
4,She's a really good lecturer and keeps the class interesting. Attendance isn't mandatory but you can get extra credit for it. A good class but you definitely do have to study a good amount for the exams. Don't skip class.
4.5,Good teacher who gives extra credit 4 or 5 times a semester for simply attending class. You have to do well on the 3 test because they are 75% of your grade. But the test material is fairly easy and simplified. Great teacher in my opinion
5,For a science class  this thing rocks. learn lots about how the world works and some stuff to take home too. Like don't build your house on a floodplain:). Really pretty interesting stuff and she brings it down to everybody's level.
5,Great class and not hard. Makes the material real by giving lots of real life examples. Lots and lots of slides keep it interesting.
5,Very easy class  powerpoint notes make it even easier to pass the test and also make the class more interesting

3.5,Dr. P is my favorite teacher at tech. took her for both virology and med & vet ent. Shes a great teacher and the classes arent too hard. take ok-ish notes and fill out the study guides she provides you for the exams and you'll easily get a B or A. another cool things is she never requires text books for any of her classes so shes a money saver
3.5,Going to class was really important for filling in the study guides and notes she provided. If you studied those  the class was pretty easy. It was a little boring  but definitely not bad. She gives extra credit quizzes (can be taken an unlimited amnt of times) that were worth up to 15 extra points for our grade. Good class.
1.5,It was a lesson in staying awake. Very Very boring. I completely lost my interest and desire to learn about this subject matter. She is as monotone as it could possibly get.

5,Salvo is the best  if you played band in high school  you really need to in college. Band with him is so fun!
5,Mr. Salvo is the best. If you haven't taken him  do it! He's great!
5,sweetest man ever!! take him if at all possible  one of the best people ever
5,Mr. Salvo is the coolest! He makes the hour and a half of community go by fast with his funny jokes and silly remarks. Take him if you can  he's a sweet old man!
5,Had Mr. Salvo for AU Community Band and he rocks! He's so funny and really makes the hour and a half go by fast. I encourage everyone to take Salvo if possible! He's a hoot!
5,Mr. Salvo rocks! He is very sweet and understanding. Also he will take time out of his schedule to help you if you need it. Highly recommended!
5,Mr Salvo is an awesome professor and believes in each of his students. Keep on being the awesome professor u r Mr. Salvo!
5,Mr. Salvo is the best! He's a real down to earth person that really cares about his students. If you need advice or help with anything  he will take time out of his day to help you. What a great teacher!
5,Mr. Salvo is a genuinely kind-heart and all around nice guy. He like having your Grandpa for a band director.

5,I love salvo he is the best... a lot better than scott garlock
5,I was always treated as an insider even though I wasn't a music major...I still get hugs when I go back after 10 years!!!
5,He cares about his students! He is the best!=)
5,I LOVE SALVO! He's so nice! And a good director.
5,SALVO IS THE BEST!!
5,awesome teacher
3.5,She uses a lot of real world connections to help apply biology to non-majors. Overall  pretty interesting class. Tests are a little difficult  though.
5,Will bend over backwards to help a student
5,Dr. Dunn is an AMAZING professor! She wont give you the class on a silver platter  but when all is said and done you will be very grateful. Heres a hint: she emails the slideshows to you  so take notes on what she says  not whats on the slide. Also  make sure you ask questions! It will help you remember! I promise
5,Very smart and nice lady. She gets students excited about the subject. Must study hard  though.
2,She's Hard! Dont take her unless your really good in Biology! She is a very nice lady though!
4.5,Great instructor
1,This was the hardest teacher I ever had....I studied my butt off and still didnt understand her or pass the test....She doesnt put what you study on the test
5,Dr. Dunn rox!
5,Dr. Dunn is a great professor  really challenging! If you put forth an effort  you'll do fine. But  if you don't attend and don't study  don't expect to get any grade other than what you deserve. She's really helpful if you have any questions  but she can't help you if you don't try!
2,This class was very difficult to me! She went over her notes and just read them...i felt like i didnt get enough explaination for the stuff she was teaching! Only grade she gave during that class was our test grades...so be prepared!
5,I wish I would have had her for the classroom part  because I enjoyed her lab so much. If you come to class  do your work  and maybe crack a book every once in a while  you will pass. She was also very helpful.
1,Is this woman really a teacher  or is this some sick joke that was played on me. do not take this class because you will regret it.
4,She was really hard  but she tried to help as much as she could.
1.5,Her class is hard. There is no homework. The only grades are tests. If you suck at taking tests and rely on homework dont take her. She is a really sweet person though.
5,No Comments
5,Class is difficult but very enjoyable.
4.5,Dr. Dunn is a great person and teacher  but her class is not an easy A. DO YOUR HOMEWORK and DON'T GET BEHND. You must study  study  study (and not at the last minute.) She is willing to help anyone who's willing to help themselves.
5,I love Dr. D.
4,Dr. Dunn is a great teacher but her class is no walk in the park  you really have to study and do your homework or you just won't stay afloat in her class.
4,No Comments
4,Even though we are slightly past midterms  I have thoroughly enjoyed his class. When I decided to take his class many people told me not to take it  but he is very personable. The best way to pass his class is to write down what's on the board and then refer back to the book to take more in depth notes. I will definitely be taking his class again.
4.5,Amazing  brilliant professor who challenges you to learn. Tells you exactly what to do. Won't let idiots monopolize class time. I wish more professors would shush the narcissists like that. Very concerned for students while pushing you to use your brain  make it work  and improve your ability to figure things out for yourself.
4.5,"It is evident that he is smart in class  but one-on-one--he is terrible (obnoxious)! He does play favorites in class! An instructor should NEVER make a student feel ""stupid!"" If we knew everything  there would be no need to even take classes. He has a huge ATTITUDE PROBLEM!"
4,i had langley for abnormal psychology and honestly its not hard if you do the work. just make sure and study whatever he writes on the board show up for class and do your online assignments. people who say this class is hard didnt put in the effort to pass because im a C or B student and i walked out with an A but never missed a class or assignment
4,Loved the class! Very interesting material. Dr. Langely is very funny and entertaining. Easy A if you show up to class and take notes!
1,Took him for an online class & didn't learn anything relevant to the subject. Only thing I learned: how to make a Wiki page (which I'll never use again). He assigned 2-4 useless assignments A DAY (including WEEKENDS). Had to call his secretary several times for help because he would never return emails. BEYOND unorganized & not helpful at all.
1,His classes are totally unorganized. Horrible to try to take notes from his lectures.
5,One of the smartest professors I ever saw. I really like that he tries to make sure he's not wasting our time. He wants questions but not the attentionseekers who just want to hear themselves talk. He can come across like a hardass to keep slackers in line but he tells you exactly what you need to study  he wants you to succeed. Very funny.Awesome!
4.5,Love dthe class. Dr. Langley is a very effective lecturer.
4,No Comments
3.5,He is a nutcase but he's awesome. His courses are very interesting.
4,No Comments
5,2001 grad. I honestly used a lot of the info from his courses in my masters and for my psychology license. I really appreciated how he didn't fill up class time with BS and actually provided practical material.
5,"Dr. Langley was/is an amazing professor. I always found his sense of humor... well  humorous  and enjoyed the way he ""weeded out"" the ""not-so-bright"" individuals in our classes. He is the reason I graduated from college."
4,He is an okay teacher. Take notes and study them. He tests from what notes he gives in class  unless your in Forensic Psych. He can be a jerk  so try to stay on his good side. Most people dont like him but as far as learning goes  hes it. He knows his field  sometimes he thinks he knows everything. But like I said  stay on his good side or he can m
5,This was one of the most useful classes I have ever taken. It helped me learn the great variety that the field has to offer. Dr. Langley is smart and funny. He rewards effort. He does not play favorites  although he certainly puts lazy students in their place  trying to teach them to get their act in gear now before they go out in the real world.
2,I did not learn very much in this particular class with Dr. Langley. We had daily assignments in which we repeated the same things over and over. There was a lot of information in our textbooks for the class that I would have enjoyed really going into  but we never did other than in class presentations. I did not like the way the class was taugh
5,Hilarious teacher. Very knowledgable in his area of study.
4,well  i think he's hot. apparently i'm the only one. oh  and his teaching is alright too.
5,One of the most interesting classes I have ever taken. I really appreciated that he didn't let idiots in the classroom get up on soapboxes and waste all our time. At the same time  he really helped us learn to think about the material. It was work and fun.
5,Awesome class. Manas is a first-rate professor. She is a bit intimidating because of her superior knowledge and her great style sense. The content is hard but doable if you read the book/get help from friends.
4.5,One of the best professors. She makes it very easy to understand the complex material in the class. The homework is really hard but the tests are really easy.
4,Dr. Manas is probably one of the best professors I've had. She actually expects us to  you know  learn and apply things. Her classes are extremely complex  but genuinely cares about her students and wants them to understand the material.
5,Excellent professor. Goes out of her way to make sure everyone understands the material. That doesn't mean it's easy.
4.5,She knows her sh*t. A freaking math genious to boot. She really wants you to understand the material  and is always very helpful  and is more than willing to reexplain for clairity. She also realizes that the material is extremely complicated  so she makes the tests easy. :)
1,This class is beyond difficult and he is really boring. I do not recomend this professor to anyone.
1,Do not take him.
1,Mr. Halperns assignments where not to hard  but when it comes to Mid Term and Final time consider yourself SOL on the meager notes that he provides you.
5,Definitely my favorite professor I've ever had. The work is easy and everything is beyond interesting. He knows his history without a doubt! He was very open to discussion and opinions. He uses history books (like Ella Price's Journal) to guide his class. He explains things so clear. Take lots of notes. Absolutely LOVED this class!
1.5,A M.Ed. and Ph.D. later...still by far one of the least interesting professors I've had!
2.5,I hated this class. I have never not liked a professor  but I cannot stand this man. If you have ANY conservative values  RUN! All he does is talk about how horrible conservatives are and how wonderful liberals are. Even when you can prove him wrong  he will ignore any arguments against his teaching. Unfortunately  I can't type enough for stories.
4,I like Prof. Halpearn because if you wanted to get an A in the class  you could. I was border line an A  and he let me do a book review for bonus on a topic I was interested in that boosted me to an A. He didn't grade very hard  and since him a lot of professors I have had just grade by quizzes and tests so there is no extra credit.
1,He's boring  condescending  and all he ever does is talk about black history and how horrible Southerners are. He has no concept of Southern history. You cannot argue with him at all. He is right. Period.
3,He is hard  study if you take his class.
2,The worst class ever.
1,No Comments
1,He is so DULL and he has several very distracting little ticks. I really like history but he was just too much. I highly discourage anyone from taking any of his classes!
4,Very knowledgeable
2,No Comments
3,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!
2,Jesus this man is boring. If you like being treated like you're 12 then by all means take this class.
2.5,One word  boring! Bring your pillow to class.
3,"I would rather watch paint dry... It would be more exiting than having to sit through his ""pre-school"" style lecture."
1.5,This guy makes Ben Stein look interesting. Sit behind someone big  so you can sleep undetected.
2,Passive aggressive. Doesn't treat students with respect and is more of a dictator instead of a mentor.
1,Not a good teacher. Passive aggressive. Very rude. Snarky. Don't take his class. He's honestly the worst person I've ever met.
2.5,Felt more like an art director than a teacher. Very different from the other conceptual brains at saic. Runs an ad agency so i guess its fitting. Class was dull and did not move forward at all. Very arrogant and moody person. Glad to have found the amazing women of viscomm. Much more passion from them.
1,i love how teachers talk nice about themselves on this site lol
5,good job!!
4.5,this is agood instructor--the best one teaching type. the others are dull and boring. u can tell he really cares about and knows type and design. and yeah he's a little hot. kinda strict about getting work done and hates excuses but its usually managable. really learned alot how to work with type and be a good desniger.
4.5,changed how i see type. very inspiring. hard teacher. takes attendance. doesn't like it when people don't put his class at top of priorities.
5,great teacher hot hot hot slackers need not apply
4.5,Very help insturctor. Made me see and think about ype different. I became more interested in design because of his insites. He assigns alot but the homeowrk is manageable and the projects are usually interesting.
4,A tough instructor but THE BEST ONE! Other istructors at this school don't really teach you--they don't tell you what to do to fix a project or improve something. I got great advice on how to improve my projects. I really learned in this class.
5,Excellent instructor--the best I've ever had. The projects were fun and I learned a lot about design--in other classes I feel like I didn't learn about design. His critism is direct and honest. if your lazy or make excuses all the time  he doesn't like that. This instructor is excellent!!
4,just-above-so-so designer enforcing his opinions as well as some pretty insightful comments.. always has a kind word for the deserving  but dont bother with anything less
1,Yes evil  the worst teacher has no respect for the student. if he is angry he just leave the class and do not return  then spend next class yelling at us instead of helping us  swear a lot  mark up our works  very cocky  think he is the best  waste of $$
1,An evil  evil man. Loves to swear and yell at the class. But  don't try too hard - nothing is good enough anyway. Thinks he's a good dresser. Ha.
5,perfect teaching
2,She doesn't have a lot of experience and it is hard to hear her even if you're sitting infront.I had a hard time in her class  but she gives some extra credit. Students should ask many questions about each problem.
1,Take it from someone who usually likes their professors  this teacher(grad. student) made me want to quit college! Completely unfair grading  very unclear  is not confident in her teaching abilities. She gave me a C I give her the finger.
4,the material in this class is sooooo simple  but people will waste time with dumb questions that she just explained  I would say that the students mess this class up not the teacher.
2,Sorry  but this woman does not know how to teach. She's just a graduate student so dont expect much from her. The class is pretty easy but if you take this teacher you're better off reading the book and teaching yourself.
4.5,i would definitely recommend taking her class. she realy knows her stuff and is pretty kick back. tests and quizzes were challenging so go to class!
4.5,quizzes almost every week  but I would recommend taking Nohrden- she is a good teacher
2.5,No Comments
1.5,Very Theologically Liberal narrow minded. Don't let him know if you disagree with his opinions  he will explode. Not a great teacher either. EXPLOSIVE TEMPER
3,no cell phones in class - NEVER forget to turn it off or he will bust you a new one. Don't be late. He is not easy  but he knows his stuff.
3,DO NOT BE LATE TO CLASS! If you are going to be late: Just go to the UC. You'll get your feelings hurt if you walk in late. Papers must include what he wanted you to talk about (even though he didn't clarify this before you turned it in) Grading is not fair. Just says to try harder next time. Read all the text book and understand it for test.
3.5,he knows his stuff. good class if you are interested in the subject  but if just taking to get credit it could be a pain...
4.5,Great teacher for new testament but its not easy to make an A!
3.5,avoid this man at all costs!! his tests are essays which he grades according to HIS opinions and what HE thinks is important. no extra credit  and no make-ups. cell phones are the devil to him and DON'T be late!! he will freak out on you!
4,Overall  just a complete jerk! Rude to students and anyone elses view that differs from his is wrong.
2,i agree he is a very angry man! dont have your cellphones on during his class he freaks out
1,He is an angry  angry  man. But he is smart. He knows everything about the subject  but he just can't teach. He wasn't born to teach. Simple as that. He hates being interrupted and will literally yell if he is disturbed. Don't be late. but I advise that you take someone (ANYONE) else!!!
3,TESTS are VERY hard! there is alot of reading material  but the essays are not hard to do  that's what saved my grade! he is pretty easy to work with  he is willing to have meetings before you begin your essays & he even dropped all the tests except the final (just kept the essays) be willing 2 work
2.5,Knows a great deal about his subjects  but seems to expect the students to know as much as himself. Not very sympathetic or helpful. Don't EVER let your cell phone go off in class either. He goes crazy!
1,yippee for lippy. i loved the class. most teachers are shy about saying what they think and making their views the centerpiece  but dr. lippy told us where he stood and even tried to talk us into agreeing with him. i respect that.
3.5,I loved Dr. LIppy!!! He really encouraged me to think outside the box  and we had a ton of class discussion  which made the course really interesting. He wanted us to learn on our own  then share what we learned and our opinion on it.
3.5,hard!!!!!!!!!
1.5,No Comments
2,He treats you like you are in elementry school. He grades tests and papers according to his views
2.5,Professor Lippy seems to be a brilliant individual  and he really knows the material. Professor Lippy  however  lacks the ability to communicate that material to his students. He is very difficult to deal with and tends to get angry easily.
4,really challenges you to consider the material

2.5,work was easy in class  and ridiculously hard outside of it.
4.5,LOVED Mrs.Everage! If you took AP Calc in high school this will simply be a refresher course. If you're struggling though  she's always more than willing to help you so go to those help sessions she offers. Use and abuse the online egrade practice quizzes.
3,Funny. Just have to study a lot.
5,If ur the type of student that needs to learn to understand a subject and nt just memorize  she's good for u. The flaw is that she moves quickly but if u keep up on eGrade u'll b fine. Go to class! U get extra points.Go to her if u need help
4.5,Ms. Everage is the most helpful  sweet woman. I had to take college algebra and i am not a math person so the material was so difficult for me to grasp. I went to her office hours so many times and she was so determined for me to pass the class. GREAT teacher and person in general. You are lucky if you get her as a teacher.
4.5,Great teacher! I'm not very good at math and the material was challenging. Lectures go kinda fast but she always offers her time to help. Go to class because she gives daily points for being there and it really helps to go. Once a week she holds an optional hour long study session which really helps with test and quizzes.
4.5,This class was a difficult class  and you have to work for good grades on the tests  but she is an AMAZING teacher! She cares a lot about her students and is so nice if you approach her through email or in person. I had to go to her office hours for extra help but when I did  she was very helpful. Lots of quizzes to cushion your grade. Love her!
5,She is an amazing professor. She is so enthusiastic and really cares about her students. I loved getting up every morning and going to class. I recommend trying to go to every class because she moves quickly which is the only bad thing. If you miss one day it is possible you could be a little lost but she is extremely helpful.
2,Probably one of the WORST teachers you will ever have. You will have to attend tutoring or use Blackwelder's videos because this woman can't teach to save her life. Her notes are crazily disorganized so when it's time to take the practice test YOU HAVE NO CLUE WHERE TO LOOK. If you get her as a teacher..good luck
1,This professor is the nicest old lady I have ever seen  however I CANT LEARN!! She doesn't really teach  she simply goes over the problems as we watch.
4.5,Mrs. Everage is the sweetest lady ever! She is very helpful and cares great deal about her classes. Do not buy the textbook you will not use it once! Make sure to go to class everyday  you will get points on some days just for showing up. If you keep up with the online homework everyday  you will do well.
4.5,Mrs. Everage is the sweetest lady ever! She is very helpful and cares great deal about her classes. Do not buy the textbook you will not use it once! Make sure to go to class everyday  you will get points on some days just for showing up. If you keep up with the online homework everyday  you will do well.
3,I had her for Summer C at FSU. It was ridiculously fast paced and I got lost since she is very hard to follow. I ended up relying on the videos that Blackwelder put up on her website. If you can  TAKE BLACKWELDER INSTEAD! But if you are very sharp and attentive  and do the online homework religiously  then you should be fine.
4.5,Fast pace but she is very passionate about what she teaches. She is very helpful  always willing to answer questions students have before and after class. Gives extra credit most days for coming to class. DO ONLINE HOMEWORK. it really reallly helps even if you know the material already. do not buy the book  you'll never ever use it
2.5,This professor was very hard to follow. Her lectures were all over the place and did not specify what actually was needed to be learned for the tests and quizzes. Had to get a tutor to explain some of the material. I would not recommend taking her if you aren't prepared to teach yourself.
4.5,Great teacher! Make sure you go to class as she randomly takes attendance and gives you extra credit points. Very clear with her lectures. Teaches kinda fast but always has helpful homework posted.
4,She is SO sweet but if you get on her bad side she can be really intense. She goes fast at times  but over all she is a good teacher. She REALLYYYY cares about her job and her students. She can seem kinda crazy if you don't appreciate her humor. WARNING - NEVER LEAVE CLASS BEFORE ITS OVER unless you get permission before class to do so.
3,If you are a fast thinker in math she is the best  if not DO NOT TAKE HER! She is a sweet old lady  but man  she whizzes through everything so quickly inside of class  and outside of it. She goes way too fast  and I was always lost. If you can't think fast in math  don't take her class.
3.5,She's a good professor but she uses so many long metaphors to explain things. Do not come to class for attendance and leave without letting her know first
4,She is extreamly nice  she will help you out as much as you need it. if you are failing the class or falling behind it is because you dont pay attention in class or do the homework. she is a great teacher and i'm doing well in the class and i'm not that great at math.
5,Great prof! He knows his stuff very well.Not an easy A though  but you will learn a lot. He makes you to think out of the box. I will recommend him. He is a Marxist:) very fair prof!!
4,Great professor and really moves away from text book reading and regurgitating... Plan to do a lot of hands-on type learning and discussion. Brings in great guest lecturers who all have great points of view!
3.5,Good teacher  though it does feel like he's trying to brainwash you sometimes to believing his point of view. Raises interesting point i hadn't thought of. A lot of work! be prepared!
4,Very unique approach in teaching. Great Prof very knowledgable very interested in students' opinions. Alot of work required in this course. Internships are a tough experience (U are literally on your own). Good experience though....
3.5,hippie
5,Super nice guy. The class is a ton of work and unfortunately  a huge emphasis on group projects.
4.5,I really enjoyed this class and the professor! one of the best classes i've taken at the U of M....alot of work though  so be prepared :)
4.5,Very helpful... interested in individual students & their opinions

2,I was an exercise science major with the life-long dream of attending medical school  and eventually becoming the first MD in my family. Well  I went by his office several times about what I could do outside of my academia to improve my chances of entry  and to my surprise he told a different answer each visit. Reminds of a indescisive woman
2,He's the Devil incarnate. Right now I can already tell you he hates you. Evil! Avoid at all times.
3,pretty good
2.5,For a 3000 level class  he expected you to perform at a 3rd year GRAD LEVEL class. It was ridiculous. Very boring  very general in teaching  but super-specific in testing. DO NOT TAKE FOR LAB!!!! Extremely ridiculous in grading the labs. Do take him for 1101  very easy....but not for animal phys
2,I felt like he taught in a general sense and tested on a much more specific basis. I do not like his teaching method.
5,very helpful  I was not even supposed to be advised by him  just showed up for some help  and he was available. above and beyond. some wish to complain about hard work and too many classes  but they are pre-med??! If you cannot take 5 hard undergrad courses at once  you will not survive med school
3,If you are majoring in Bio  by all means take him. But if not  stay clear. Like one said before  he teaches at one level and expects you to know it at a much higher leve.
5,skip is super hot and lots of fun! his class is not hard at all! YOU SHOULD TAKE IT!
4.5,He is kinda boring  but if you do the study guide that is half the test. He is really nice and will help you if you go to his office. He always want people to come see him and makes himself very available. GOOD GUY!!!
1,some may never go to medical school but rather than guide and help he discourages and tells you that you don't have a chance. find someone else if you want help and advice or do it yourself  he reserves real effort for those who are a sure bet to get in.
3.5,He is not that bad at all. Bio is a class you have to study for  bottom line. He gives you study questions that ARE on the test. He is a nice guy  just study the outlines and you will do fine.
1,Doesnt know his job.I'm not sayin this b/c apparently U THINK I'm failing this class.U prolly never took so many damn classes at the same time or else u would know how much work is involved & if U cant take criticism well this website is not for u.Peace!
1,"Worst prof i have ever had  reads off p.p. and doesnt teach the concepts  test are hard  SI himself said to me  ""he teaches at one level and expects you to know at a much higher one"" class is boring and I got nothing more out of the course then"
5,Great teacher. He gives outlines with every chapter  and review questions before the tests. He presents his information on power point  making the lectures easy to follow. Study hard  and you'll do great!
4.5,contrary to most  this guy is a great adviosor  but puts thing to the point which is great all of you who are dissin him as an advisor are prolly just failing and he told u that u aint gonna be a doctor
1,the worst advisor you will ever find.Supposedly he's the chair of the Pre-Med department but doesnt know anything.He told me to take botany and zoology at the same time with 4 other subjects and wanted me to take stats  all at the same time! Crazy person!

2.5,no good 
4.5,Very helpful teacher with good intentions but boring as crap! Hands out notes  so theres no need to go to class  except he takes attendence and then makes you sit in class while he reads the notes to you!!! BORING! Test are hard.
1.5,I think he might be the only one that takes attendence. Most people study for other classes during his class... can pass if you go to study sessions... i'm sure there are better though.
3,Not a Great prof for LART class. The class is required and not very interesting to begin with. He takes it more seriously than most of the other professors and mostly talks the entire time.
4.5,I'm still unsure whether it was the prof or the curriculum  but this class was pretty disappointing. We talked in circles  rarely made references to the assigned readings  were expected to do LONG writing assignments with little lead time  and the semester project was frustrating. You'll have to push yourself to get something from this course.
5,Great prof.!
4,Hard course  good basics - study
3.5,ugh..this class is gay... damn requirements!
4.5,just talk in class and you'll do fine
2,I had a hard time with this prof---he seemed arrogant  unconcerned  and would not bend over grading that seemed unfair.
5,HOT!!!!

5,Absolutely one of the best professors I have ever had. He makes you feel like what you have to say is important and valid no matter what the case may be. If he had not given me such a good impression I would have no further interest in philosophy. He gives very fair tests  does a great job preparing you for it  and is considerate with his grades.
4,He seems nice and outgoing. There were quizzes almost every day. The final was hard and it required remembering EVERYTHING.
5,Rick Repetti is simply the best instructor for Core 10! He is nice  gives a midterm  final  and asks everyone to present one of their beliefs in front of the class. He is a easy grader and does not fail anyone. There are also no research papers.
5,This course is absolutely a difficult course  regardless of the professor you have. If you're not 100% invested in learning Russian  then Gerry is NOT the professor for you. He is brutally tough  but he is an excellent teacher and makes sure that you learn Russian correctly and to a good level of proficiency.
3,"I PROMISE you...you'll be thankful for his ""strict"" teaching method! It's actually necessary for him to teach in such a way  it helps you understand the language at the most vital stage. I'm so thankful he instilled fear in me to make sure my work was done and vocab was memorized. People who don't appreciate it don't deserve to learn Russian."
2,Gerry is a seriously rude individual  and he expects you to know how to understand fluent Russian from day 1 - he doesn't speak English in class. The pace of the class is also fast and demanding for an elementary language course.
4.5,Jerry is tough. He expects a lot of you and will not tolerate slacking. However  if you put in the effort you will learn a ton. He has a truly impressive grasp of the language and is extremely clear. If you really want to learn Russian and don't mind a challenge  take him.
3.5,You have to have interest in the subject with Jerry. If you don't do your work he will get on your case. If you do what you have to do you'll be fine. Also a funny guy and loves if you show a passion for your work.
3,Intermediate Russian (0030 & 0040) is definitely challenging. He expects a LOT from his students and the pace is pretty quick. You do most of the learning from the textbook & go over assigned work in class to clarify. Class is almost all in Russian. Requires a lot of studying  effort  homework every night  class participation.
4,Jerry's classes are tough. He expects a LOT from his students  but is very knowledgeable about all things Russian. He gives you all you need to know in lecture so take a lot of notes & do the readings to participate (25% of your grade). Tests are a crap shoot of what will be there  but if you attend class  take good notes  & study you can do well.
1.5,If you are a beginner  STAY AWAY. Mean  demeaning  and impossibly hard. Take his class only if torture is your style.
1,Gerry is mean  demanding  unhelpful and ridiculously hard for an entry level course. Try to avoid him if you can.
3,horrible teacher  run run run. doesn't have all his marbles
4,He's a little intimidating at first  but you get used to his style. He throws alot at you and expects you to pick it up quickly. The course was difficult at first  but got easier when I got used to his style. Definitely read the books and go to class!
2,Very intimidating and impatient.. would not recommend him for beginners. :(
3,Very smart guy..has a truly impressive grasp on the language for a non-native speaker. Very difficult though  and kind of mean. He can be rude and expects too much in my opinion. If you have to take Russian with him  you will certainly learn a lot  but I recommend choosing someone else if possible.
4,Gerry's a little strange (he barked at us the first day..) but a really good teacher and he is very good at explaining concepts in ways that American students will understand. Oral exams are really hard and you're expected to know a lot of vocab  but the chapter tests are really simple. Just do the hw and be prepared for class and you will do fine.
4.5,Gerry was pretty much awesome. The class was 9 am  Monday to Friday  and I never thought about sleeping through it. Take him if you can!
5,By the time you're in Russian IV more is expected of you  and once he knows you can do it he'll treat you with a good deal of respect. Seems almost obsessed with covering more ground than just the textbook  and is focused on all aspects of Russian  from pronunciation to paragraph structure. Great foreign language professor  definite recommendation.
4.5,He was a great professor. He definitely knows what he's doing. Like everyone else says  he can be harsh but its definitely well deserved. If you do what you're supposed to and just make an attempt to participate you'll find that you have no problems with him. Overall  his class is extremely amusing and he may just be my favorite professor.
5,Terrific teacher  would recommend to anyone!
4.5,Gerry is seriously  my favorite teach ever. If you don't like him  it's probably because you're kind of boring and lamecity. I was not a particularly great student  Gerry grades very harshly  but he was very encouraging and personable. I got many bunk grades in his class  but that's because I was kind of a **** up. In my opinion  he knows what'
3.5,His command of Russian is excellent for a non-native speaker and he is a very effective recitation instructor. However  he has a very harsh personality which takes some adjustment.
2,The only thing i do not like about this teacher is that it is hard to understand what he is saying. You have to pay attention closely and ask a lot of questions becuase you get lost in what he is saying. Either he doesn't teach very well or maybe i just can't keep up with him. He likes to skip around in the text book.
3.5,Fair teacher - not bad to take.
4,Not nearly as bad as I've heard.
3.5,Goes very slow so he wont leave anyone who puts forth any effort behind.

4.5,Epic.
4.5,Sensei is so awesome! I look forward to this class so much. Like I wanted spring break to end so I could come back to class. It's a very interactive class  and you definitely learn a lot. just make sure you COME TO CLASS and do ALL the homework.
4.5,Awesome!
4,Sensei Manes is great! She makes class fun  despite the inevitable challenges that arise while trying to learn such a difficult language. I would definitely recommend her classes.
5,You'll never stop having fun in the class. You'll need to study  but you become friends with EVERYONE in your class so studying is easy. Also  she doesn't give much work since it's a language class and it takes time to learn. You'll laugh so much you'll be crying  that's how amazing this class is. Sensei is the best teacher I've had yet. Period!
4.5,She is so much fun! She made a seemingly difficult language very fun and easy to learn. All you have to do in this class to succeed is to practice writing and memorizing your characters! Most of it is really up to you  but as far as her teaching style  she makes the task interesting and fun.
3,Not a bad teacher  but it wa kinda hard to understand what she was tring to say sometimes due to the language barrier. Also she had an odd ordering of theaching  she taught us a lot of stuff we may never use.
5,Sensei Manes is very nice and funny. She is a good language teacher.
5,I really like her. She really knew her stuff.

2.5,Steve is a very good teacher. I came to Canada from another country and English is not my first language. Steve really helped me to become a better communicator and I loved his classes.
4.5,Steve is a very good teacher. He takes an interest in students and helps  encourages. I enjoyed his class because he treats you with fairness and respect.
2,Could be more helpful in assignments. When taking tests they feel like a guessing game
2,Steve was not very helpful  the tests feel more like guessing games as they cover material we have not learnt in class. Worst teacher in the Business school.
3.5,M'kay?

5,Brad is a great teacher and a true professional. He is very approachable so do not hesitate to go see him if you are having a hard time. His lectures are interesting and well put together. His tests are difficult if you do not follow his review outline. I really enjoyed my experience with him as a prof.
1,does not tell you but takes marks off for wrong answers. Better to not answer than attempt. Going in for extra help will not help you  sucking up and whining will.
4.5,Brad's lectures are engaging and he uses several different media to keep students interested. He's an awesome resource if you're struggling and he'll definitely help you out as much as he can. Overall  really awesome  funny  and helpful prof.
4,Really great teacher  who wants everyone to be on the same page and will go out of his way to make sure you know whats going on. Long lectures  and even longer tests  with some last minute marking. But overall a stellar time.
5,Amazing professor. Extremely nice person. Tough  but fair. Has a great  engaging teaching style. Not too hard on the eyes either.
5,Awesome professor who really cares about his students and their performance. If you're having a hard time getting it  he will go over material until he explains it in such a way that you understand it. There are not nearly enough professors like him in the world. He's funny but he's tough too. You do your job as a student  and you will pass. :)
5,His reviews are always the test!
5,Awesome prof! He's funny and fun to watch

5,David Briggs is the best teacher I have ever had in any subject. He is knowledgeable  kind  funny  and helpful. Both his classes are excellent and have taught me a lot about the subject matter and life in general. His classes are great to get you in shape and have fun and learn.
5,This is one of the best classes I have taken at Bucks. He really cares if you can protect yourself in the real world . You can apply what he teaches to you in you daily life.. This is a class i recommend for every student ... He is a great inspiration.
5,Briggs is an excellent teacher. He cares about his students and helps you succeed with understanding self defense tactics!
5,BEST Professor I've ever had. SOO Encouraging  Humerous and Genuinely Sweet. Highly recommended for any and all courses he teaches. Master of MANY FORMS OF MARTIAL ART....
5,anyone who complains about Briggs is an idiot. Yes there are papers and tests. ITS A COLLEGE COURSE MORON  not a tiger schulmans. Of course you have to do some work besides just tai chi.Besides  he makes the tests and the papers as laid back and easy as he possibly can. You could have written about anything and he would have accepted it. Great guy!
3,I took tai chi as a gym class because i needed to for my major. I figured it would be easy and hardly any out of class work for a 2 credit physical education class. So he gives us two 5 page papers to write on basically nothing  and 2 tests. who the hell does he think he is? dont take tai chi unless your looking for added pointless homework
5,Dave is a great guy. He really knows how to engage the class and make you extremely interested in what he is teaching you. He's tough but fair. Definitely the only professor you should be learning personal defense from. He is the man.
3.5,"I had Briggs for pers. def. Each day we would start with a warm-up & then cont. on with learning basic self def. skills. Class was fairly easy there is a short midterm & final each had about 20 ques. For both midterm & final u hav to show him ur ""moves."" He asks for a movement taught & u then have to do it  this is the 2nd pt. of the test. He's"
5,Mr. Briggs is down to earth  entertaining  very knowledgable and made me care about a course that was originally just to satisfy a requirement.
5,If ever you wanted a real life Yoda  Dave is the man. Humorous  friendly  engaging and actively involved in students' goals and inquiries. Sometimes he invites the class to stay after if they like to practice more advanced techniques. I'm very glad to have taken this class
5,Cool teacher. He helped me a lot and made me feel like I was wanted there :). I am an international student and Dave really helped me not feel weird. He always explained things to me and to the other students and had a huge smile on his face. Great instructor!
5,This was a great class. i don't think i ever missed a class he was a great guy and would recomend it for you gym credit or just to take it
5,Briggs is an excellent teacher and keeps everyone in the class motivated. Take Tai Chi. Not only do you learn the technique  but insiteful points on the history of it. Also a great guy to hang out with and ask for advice.
5,David is one of the coolest and most down to Earth teachers I have ever met. His defense class if very informative and helpful for the real world. It is highley recommended to take him for Tai Chi. His class is amazing and ill never forget it. Meditation is a huge part of my life now. Thanks Dave!!
5,Dave is highly motivated  professional yet relaxed  and dedicated to his students. Very talented and a descent guy. He gives good advice to his students (not just related to personal defense). Take his class.
5,Dave ROCKS! His class was so fun and physical. He makes you feel wanted in class no matter what your skill level. And the extra arm and wrist locks he taught me and only me in class were awesome...helped me beat my partner up for the final...HAHAHA. Take Dave!
5,He's an excellent instructor. No matter what skill level you are physically  he will never make you feel out of place. All around great teacher who obviously loves his job. Very highly recommend for Personal Defense and Tai Chi.

4,Bob is one of the best Prof. I've ever had. To bad he is retiring  he will be hard to replace
4,Bob is a very smart man and he keeps it intresting. Love the guys attitude
5,Bob was an amazing teacher. Read the chapters before hand and you'll understand what he is talking about in class. His tests are not bad if u do the reading. He is a very wise and brilliant professor and should be repected. Those who want to talk bad about him should try doing the work before they are going to blame their misfortunes on Bob!!!
2.5,All he does is put up overheads and babble on for hours about things we don't know about  and not in a way for us to learn. Then there's the random stories he just goes off on.
5,I LOVED this teacher. He seems super intimidating and grumpy at first but he was so great. Study for his exams and you'll ace them. He's funny  he interacts with the students  kids around about all sorts of stuff. All around awesome teacher!
1,Poor teacher getting retired and cranky 
1.5,He slaps overheads up and talks for hours on end. Too fast to write down.

4,I was a freshman English snob who thought I was too good to take freshman English  but I really enjoyed her class. Lauren kept things lively and taught us really practical things.
5,kingsley is the most brilliant  intelligent  and effective teacher at U of M. She is an extremely tough grader  but she is a constructive critic- my writing improved tremendously bc. of this prof.
5,She is one of the best writing profs. at U of M...if you get the opp. to take a class with her  grab it!
4,A hard prof and a tough grader  but the class will improve your writing tremendously. The books are interesting and the discussion is engaging. A good choice for intro writing.
3.5,what they said ^
4.5,While she is an extremely hard grader (do not expect an A)  she is extremely fair in her teaching  and if you put in the time--your grade reflects it. She is always willing to help you at any time. Great book selection!
3,She is a very hard grader but if you are willing to meet with her in office hours frequently she can be very helpful. don't take the class planning to get an A
2,really hard grader. She's always all over the place and pretty unclear about assignments. One time someone was unsure of an assignment and even she couldn't remember what the assignment was.
2.5,She is a hard grader  but you'll learn a lot about writing in this class. There is a lot of discussion in class and there are frequently group critiques of papers.

2,If you're thinking about taking this professor save yourself a headache and don't! She makes sure that it's impossible you get an A. She lectures EVERY single class  rambles the ENTIRE time. She expects you to talk in discussion to get your participation/attendance grade. Assigns 3-4 ch. plus other readings to do EVERY night. INSANE work for gen ed
4,Dr. Spock is an incredibly nice person and seems to genuinely care about her students succeeding. That said  the class is harder than you would expect. Its a lot of dense reading and she lectures the full class (sometimes a couple minutes after) but the tests aren't impassable. If you're a history major take her  but if not find someone easier.
2,Dr. Spock was very good at giving lectures  but the course load is insane. I'm talking three or four assignments due every week. This was a general education course for me  but this was the class I spent the majority of my time studying and doing homework for. It is a very difficult class and you will not pass without effort. I would NOT recommend
4,I loved Dr. Spock! Her class is probably one of the harder ones that I'm currently taking  but she gives LOTS of extra credit and is always ready to help. You will do more writing than you might like  but she gives good feedback. Lots of reading  lots of class participation. It's a tough class for a gen ed  but I would definitely take her again
4,She's a really nice lady. However  there is lots of homework and it gets tiring to do. What we learn about I feel is kinda irrelevant so it makes it hard to listen in class and absorb the information.
2,You have to attend class to understand what she makes you read. She lives  breathes and bleeds Russia. Shes a great person and i like her as a person  but as a professor
4.5,She was difficult for a 100 level course. Four tests all semester including the final. Not difficult at all as long as you do the work and take the notes. I loved her! Great personality.
1,This class is an absolute joke. The class material will put you to sleep and have you wondering why you are even in the class. The teacher is rude and very annoying. It is a 100 level gen ed class and she acts like it is a 500 level class or something. Way to much pointless work  way to hard of grading work and in general just an unlikeable person
4.5,Dr. Spock is one smart lady. Not many people know as much about history as she does  especially when it comes to the Mongols and Russia. If you are a history minor or major you will benefit greatly from her class  however
3.5,This class is doable  but given another option I would have definitely taken it. It's a lot of unnecessary reading and responding. The tests quizzes are difficult and the essays are impossible. She does offer a lot of help though so there's that. It's entirely too much work for a gen ed course.
5,Dr. Spock was very helpful in all the assignments and gave great feedback
4.5,Dr.Spock is a brilliant teacher  she knows what she is speaking about. She understands that we all are college students and tries to help us in anyway possible. Pay attention and take notes or you will not pass...
5,Shes an awesome teacher  her work is difficult but she knows what she is talking about. If you listen and do the work you will learn a lot.
5,Dr Spock is one of my favorite teachers. She is a very hard grader  and getting an A from her on a project is hard  but if you really work hard  you will get an A in the class. She is VERY helpful outside of class. On your research project for CIV  GO SEE HER! She is great  this is just a very hard class.
4.5,Dr. Spock is a hard professor. But she will help you if you ask for it! She is flexible if you have circumstances outside of class and she will try her best to help you in anyway she can!! I recommend taking her classes if you want to be challenged and learn a great deal!!
5,She is probably the best professor at EKU. She teaches what you need to know  and goes into depth clearly. However  her class is a little hard. You NEED to study for this class  hands down. Don't care what you do. She openly accept requests for help via email  appointments etc. A GREAT teacher. You won't regret taking this class.
5,Russian History: TOUGH CLASS! But she will warn you of that ahead of time. However  VERY helpful to students both in class and outside of class. Russian history was very interesting though there is a LOT of writing. Get an A in her class  it will make you feel like you can accomplish ANYTHING!
5,Love this woman!!
3,this class requires lots of study and memorization. you will have to be able to label maps and talk about things in lengthy detail. 2 papers were required in this course and also 2 quizes and 2 test. you will have 7 reading respoces that will have about 5 questions to them. they are woth 25 points each. Dr. Spock is a great teacher!!
5,The class is what it says it is  research methods. The material she teaches you is invaluable throughout the rest of your time as a history major. Although she is very tough when it comes to writing  she grades fairly and will help you no matter what the problem is. I believe the class is now HIS 290.
4,Oh Judy  she frustrated me  made me laugh  forced me to learn how to teach myself. She's not that great of a teacher really  but she's super nice and super cute 
5,Awesome teacher  very intelligent
5,I loved having Val as a teacher!
1,Unclear expectations of what we should know/be tested on.
1,She goes on and on about the same information probably a good nurse but not prof
3,Val genuinely cares about her students. She can be intimidating with first impressions  but if you're struggling and go see her one-on-one she will work with you and help you understand the content. She is an amazing clinical preceptor who is very tough and makes you work hard  but is always on your side.
1,She doesn't provide adequate information for any assignments  learning material  or reviews. She spends hours talking about pointless information on material that students have already learned or we have absolutely no idea what she's talking about. Terrible prof. Good nurse  but terrible prof.
1,Feels like she doesn't know what she's talking about. Her discussions are extensive for absolutely no reason and confuses people.
1,Bad news for everyone. Maybe she's a good nurse.. but an evil prof.

3,ummm... uhhhh.. like you know....
3,Not a bad professor but shes very unorganized and does not have an approachable demeanor  seems constantly annoyed. Not a tough grader  definitely put effort in the hw assignments. Gives study guides for test. Know the essay questions. She DOES NOT like cellphones. Shell spend 1/4 of class time lecturing about cellphones being a disruption .
4,Had her for 2 classes in the same semester and I can't say I hated either. She wants you to be in class because if not she's not going over info again. She's funny and has a lot of experience in her field.
5,She's wonderful! Lectures are full of examples in the management field as she has a great management background. 3 tests and a optional final but all come with study guides which are very helpful. 1-2 online quizzes per week but they are open note. 2 papers but not hard to write. She will help you outside of the classroom with finding internships.
4.5,By far my favorite professor at YCP. She is demanding- but only because she expects the best from her students. She truely cares to see them do well. I learned more from her than any other prof at YCP. I took 3 classes the she taught. Wonderful professor.

3.5,Very demanding instructor. Not always clear on what she is looking for. Has high expectations and grade hard.
4,DR. MEISENHELTER MADE THE CLASS INTERESTING  AS LONG AS YOU GO TO CLASS AND DO YOUR ASSIGNMENTS THERE IS NO REASON YOU SHOULD FAIL THIS COURSE. DR. MEISENHELTER WAS HELPFUL  SHE DOES NOT PUT YOU DOWN FOR NOT KNOWING AND WILL HELP IF YOU NEED IT  DO NOT BE AFRAID TO ASK.
4,Dr. Meisenhelter is not horrible. Do not take this class unless you need it. Not very interesting. She is a nice lady and will help you with anything you need. Tests are hard  but the presentation is easy. Go to class  lots of notes each day.
1,"AVOID this ""professor"". Did not grade according to his own stated criteria. Very late in returning work. Very limited participation in required online discussions."
5,HE IS ONE THE BEST PROFS I HAVE EVER HAD! HE WAS ALWAYS THERE FOR HIS STUDENTS. BRINGS PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR SHELL.
5,HE IS ONE THE BEST PROFS I HAVE EVER HAD!
4.5,Great guy  really fun classes  in my 5th of his classes. Really great.
4.5,Pretty good class. picks favorites tho. fun for first year. dont get on his bad side.
3.5,No Comments
3.5,nice guy  but can be biased in his grading. he has favorites in his classes. makes his classes fun to attend.
5,Makes students feel at home in class. I look always forward to classes and rehearsals with him. Can't wait til the sabbatical's done.
5,Interesting  enjoyable classes.
5,Brilliant. A deep thinker and a poet. I was honoured to have studied with him.
3,Brilliant and poetic thinker with a sene of ethics. Loved his students and they adored him. Quirky. Loved the magic markers. Physicist  artist  cyberethicist  sustainability. I think of the profound legacy he left. Rennaissnce man.
1.5,"Gary was obviously smart in his time. Unfortunately  he is a bit too ""senior"" now."

1,please retire soon  Boyd
2.5,VERY VERY VERY smart teacher  but I think it's time for him to retire. There is not much enthusiasm there. But he is really helpful and wants to make sure you do well.
5,Lisa is a very unique professor  which a true interest in history. She tells history in story form and really wants her students to learn and enjoy the past  and be prepared for the future.
5,Very interesting teacher... She keeps you into the lecture. Which makes it easier to keep the knowledge your hearing
3,Boring horrible reading (awful book). Tests are all essay form. Really who the hell wants to write an in-class essay for a history test? Teacher was a good speaker though  kept you interested  the book and tests did not.
1,She is very demanding for an intro class.I am an A student and received a C with no explanation except she basically did not like my essays and that is the majority of your grade on exams and projects.I went to every class and studied.She has her favorites.not to mention she is very annoying!NOT recamended unless you like to suck up to people!
5,She is very helpful  makes history fun..really i don't like history but she was awesome
2.5,5 page paper on anything you want. was told I was going to get a B if I redid an assignment....then the report card said D....still no response from this teacher about what the deal was. not recommended at all
5,Dr. Key's is a very good teacher  and really like what she does  which shows when she teaches. You will especially like her if you're a history major. Even if you don't like history she makes the subject fun to learn. Pretty fair on grading although the paper is worth quite a bit. She's great about making sure you're prepared for her tests.
5,I had her twice  because I dropped her class at LCCC. She's an excellent teacher
3,She is a tough grader an the fact that the paper has such a significant effect on your grade doesn't make sense since the paper is on anything you want to write about. r On the up side she does make the topic interesting and she really enjoys what she teaches. Also she is willing to work with you.
5,good teacher
2.5,I disliked. She gave you a good grade if she agreed with what you said  and not such a good grade if she didn't. Too subjective  and English teacher like. Only taught about France and nothing else. I didn't learn anything important. I would not recomend unless you area an ass kisser!
1.5,has her favorites and is a tuff grader if you stand up to her or ask questions that she does not like and ay to stuck on napoleon i mean hello there is more to history!!
5,Tries to be fair but does have her favorites. Loved the class learned a lot and is the best history teacher I have ever had.At least she tries to make it fun.Hated the tests an essay question should not be 6-10 paragraphs long.This is not english class.
3,I did not like this teacher because I thought she was a very unfair grader.

4.5,Best history teacher I've ever had. I learned more about history in one semester than in all my other years of school combined. They should talk her into teaching the presidency part of poli-sci.
4,No Comments
5,Wonderful teacher. The best history teacher I've ever had. If more teachers taught history like she did  there would be a lot more kids that would know their history. And have fun while they learned it  too.
4,If you are having issues with this class  drop out of the School of Journalism. This is as easy as it gets. Show up to class  pay the least bit of attention  and you'll get out with an A. The content is incredibly interesting  just listen. He won't spoon feed it to you  he expects you to learn  he's not gonna hold your hand. Great Prof.
1.5,Try to avoid this professor. The class itself has good content  but this professor is somewhat rude and does not seem to know how to treat students and help them succeed.
3.5,The speakers are very interesting and the class gives you a great overview of journalism. The daily quizzes were easy but they are written by GTFs so toughness could change each term.
4,Such a great class! He brought in people from Nike who showed un-reveled products. He is a great person to make friends with and a respected recommendation letter  and the quizzes every day are easy
5,Dr. Ryan is an amazing creative storyteller and is renowned in the multimedia community for his skills and expertise. During my time with him  we had many influential people come in as guest lecturers including the Creative Director for Coca-Cola  Design Moguls and renowned faculty. Get to know him  stay after class and participate. It will help
3.5,Bill Ryan has got to be one of the coolest teachers at the UO! if you're in his 100 level class you're in for a lot of yelling  guest lectures  and emails with links to google image searches for cats. In smaller classes it's a ton of work that may or may not be turned in and more links to cats! but the man is a genius! enjoy
4,Easily one of my favorite professors at the UO. Although he does not lead the class every time  the guest speakers that he brings in are amazing. The grade is based on quizzes taken almost every day of class  but if you pay attention  you will get 100% on every one. This was one of the easiest classes I have taken so far! I totally recommend him!
1.5,Tests were terrible and non relevant to the class material.
4.5,Ryan is a hard teacher and demands the most out of you  but trust me  in the end it will be worth it. I discovered a passion for graphic design after taking his class and I am grateful I had a professor who only wanted the best from me and wouldn't settle for meritocracy.
4.5,Ryan is the man. He'll demand the best from you  push you prod  you... but it's all worth in the end.
1.5,The most frustrating class I ever took. You could never see him during office hours  he never replied to e-mails and he was a perfectionists on the assignments. I would probably spend about 4 hours a day for 2 weeks in the computer lab for 1 assignment. tests didn't really test on what you learned (how am I supposed to remember what the photographe
3,Ryan has a very high opinion about himself. Often name drops the various famous people in the industry he has worked with or interviewed. You have to have the book-which he wrote-for his class or you will fail since 1/2 of the ? on the test are found in the text. He has an unhealthy addiction to kayaking which he brings up at least 7 times a day
3,First  he is the most arrogant professor i have ever had. He uses his own book inwhich you HAVE to read to pass the class with better than a C. We watched 384734 movies about kayaking and if you dont do what he wants on your projects  you'll get a bad grade even if your project is good. He's an ass.
4,I enjoyed Bill's class. Though he puts too much emphasis on fonts and his tests are annoying  the assignments are fun. He loves Kayaking. We are still friends until today.
1,lame-O  stay away!
4,"at first i was very encouraged and found him to be very interesting and intelligent. then i got sick of him showing his ""award winning"" work with all the ""famous"" people he interviewed in his book. i ran into someone who said she was in the j school 20 years ago and dropped out because of the arrogant teachers like ryan..."
4.5,I found Dr.Ryan to be very engaging and inspiring professor. He is extremely knowledgeable on his subject (seeing as he wrote the book on it)and although he has high standards he really takes pride in his students and is there to help you succeed in his class  the j school and the journalism field. Utilize his office hours!!!
4,Bill Ryan and his 204 class are a nice breath of fresh air in the J-School. He does have high demands and can come across as arrogant  but Ryan is probably THE teacher you will want to know outside of class. You really do learn a lot about design from him. He is well respected and can set you up with a job or internship. I enjoyed his class.
4,Very into his topics  very enthusiastic and makes this class fun. Pay attention and attend all lectures tho.
4.5,I loved most parts of this course & became frustrated with other aspects. He respects students but puts his time above all else. I LOVED his lectures & if you love design then this course will 'rock your world.' Put up with the difficult realities & prove that you know the material in your projects. He wrote the book so he tests on all of it
3.5,Convince a classmate to take notes for your and then show up for test days. You will do fine. Tedious note-giver  this class is common sense - learn the vocab and you'll do fine.
5,not bad.

1,Feth is the worst professor I've ever had. She refuses to use Blackboard so you have to constantly hound her if you want to know about your grades. She does treat you like you're stupid. The textbook for this course is useless. She uses old activities that are copied so many times they are not even legible. She is incredibly arrogant without reason
1,The worst teacher I've even took a class with in my enitre life.
1,Elle Feth is awful. Her lectures are not only boring  but incredibly complicated and far too detailed. The tests and assignments are easy  but in the end  you'll end up regretting taking the course. The testa are straightforward  however  she uses confusing language and will not clarify. Do NOT take this course with her.
4,I took the hybrid version with Feth and have no regrets! Show up for every lab for easy points and keep up on your reading and powerpoints. Tests were straight from the material.
1.5,Feth was the absolute worst professor I have ever come across at CSCC. She is boring  rude  and has a dry sense of humor. Don't bother asking questions because she refuses to answer anything. Her tests are insanely hard. Her notes rarely ever help with understanding the material. My advice is drop Feth instantly if you see her as your instructor.
4,This was a hybrid class for me and Feth was the online teacher. She responded quickly to email questions and if you read the chapters  took practice quizzes and attended your labs..the class was fine. The lab teacher was a different story and they didn't seem to communicate. Lab sheets were not graded in time for quizzes & lab teacher did not teach
2,Where do I start? Feth is awful. Grouchy. Rude. Boring. She disrespected everyone in our class and made us all feel stupid. She was completely inappropriate at times. Don't bother asking questions. Or making light conversation. Good luck if you don't understand something. I didn't use the book at all. Just notes. Hardly went b/c she was so mean.
1,I'm graduating this quarter from CSCC and am transferring to another school and from all the teachers I have had so far professor Feth is by far the worst.Everybody giving a bad review on this teacher is right. She will not answer your questions and will talk to you like you are stupid. The point in taking a class is to learn and to be guided  not
3.5,Despite what other people have said  I think she's OK. Her teaching style is not particularly entertaining  but you can't always expect that. She does not suffer fools and can be a bit grumpy  but she teaches the material in a straightforeward  well-organized manner. Just make sure you think before you ask questions.
1.5,This is the WORST teacher I have ever had in my life and if you have her I would suggest dropping it immediately. She is the most miserable women I have ever met. She talks down to all her students and if you ask her a question she will either laugh at you or embarrass you in front of the class. I hope Columbus State will get rid of her soon!!!!!
1,"This has to be the WORST teacher i have ever had. Between her dull ""put me to sleep"" lectures to her egotistical ""i wrote the text book"" attitude all the way to her absolutly ""miss one symbol and you fail"" grading she is the worst i have ever seen. She doesnt care if you fail and wont help you if you are. If you are in her class  drop it ASAP."
1.5,"She will not help you with any questions you have. She will only tell you to re-read the instructions and do nothing else. She treats you like you are still in middle school and always talks down to you. She tells you that you ""Can't"" have items like laptops even though it is allowed in the CSCC school policy."
1,The WORST teacher I have ever had. It is impossible for this woman to see past her own bombastic ego. Manipulates and mocks students when they have questions. Her License should be revoked  she only holds her possition b/c she wrote the text!
3.5,She is not an easy teacher  but really wants her students to study and learn the material. I thought she was pretty good.
5,Professor Feth is one of my favorite teachers ever. She teaches well and doesn't take any**** from immature students.
1,easily the worst teacher at the college. she is horrible. do not take her class and maybe the department will get the hint. she does not want anyone to pass her class so they have to retake it and pay more money. She blows****.
1,she isthe worst teacher i have ever had in college. if you get her drop the class. she says she is married i feel sorry for her husband that he has to wake up to her in the morning.
2,"She is known as ""failing feth"" she doesnt care about her student's grades at all and if you ask for help she laughs at you. I disliked her."
3.5,a bit uptight but overall a very good teacher.
5,Took a subject I hated and helped me grow to love it.
2.5,Organizational class was amazing.
4.5,Dr. Gruenert is a deep thinker and really wants to hear all students thoughts and opinions during class. Although he may appear to be intimidating at first  he really just wants class participation. I learned so much in this discussion-based class and would encourage anyone to take his classes.
4.5,He treats his students with respect and likes to push them to think about their beliefs from all angles.
5,Great funny stuff
5,Intelligent. Ahead of the Game. Expects Professionalism. Learning will occur. Take His classes at any cost!
5,Dr. Gruenert is intelligent and he expects you to be intelligent as well. He treats his students with respect and understanding and teaches for a practical world.
5,He is very frank  fair  and consistent. Dr. Gruenert clearly gives the expectations and he allows room for student growth. His classes are fun and he has a sense of humor. His style is different  but that's what's makes the class!

5,Very very cool teacher! I took eng26 with him. He is extremely helpful and super fun. The atmosphere in class is great. Attending every class and doing all the homeworks and you'll be good. He teached me how to write essays properly. Now I am taking 28 and getting A. But I get C+ on his class. I advice him if you want to learn how to write essays.
5,Definitely the best english teacher I ever had. Listen to his comments and how he wants you to improve on your essays  you'll receive an easy A if you listen to what he says. He really wants you to succeed in his class.
5,He's awesome.
5,great professor..he really make sure you understand everything..luckey you if u have him as a professor :)
5,Simply amazing.I would love to have a professor like him again!!! If you get him  you're truly lucky. :)
4.5,He is really down to earth guy. He understands english with a passion. this is good because you will understand the class better.the topic we read and write about is pop culture  so its never boring. Discussions are really long and intersting. He'll keep you coming back for more.
5,Great class! I took it a year ago and loved it. Centeno is a really nice guy. The class text book is Pop Culture. We wrote essays on movies  advertising  etc. Loved it! No exams really  just 1 at the end of the years which is pretty easy. Highly reccomended!
4.5,THE BEST ENGLISH TEACHER I HAVE HAD EVER. HIS PROMPTS SEEMS WEIRD BUT IN THE END YOU REALIZE IT WAS PRETTY EASY. REALLY NICE GUY WILL HELP YOU OUT WHENEVER YOU NEED IT. BASICALLY TAKE HIM IF YOU CAN
5,class focuses on POP CULTURE! very interesting discussions  Wonderful teacher  always willing to help. Always returns your essays with constructive criticism so u know HOW to improve. DEfinitely recommend him!
5,great teacher. very helpful  and willing to sit down and walk you through your essays to show you what needs work. makes the class fun  jokes around and has a good time. take this class  not that hard.
5,No Comments
5,He is the best teacher. His class is fun and the essays are easy. The book you read is pop culture very intersting. YOu should take his class.
5,he was the BEST english teacher the class is so not boring. the essays are mostly point of view and you dont have to read boring stuff the books are about pop culture. TAKE HIM
5,very helpful  and topics related to current events  we watch T.V shows and movies to write the essays. very organized  and clear  get to get out 5-7 minutes early from the class. overall great instructor.
5,Mr Centeno is a very good english teacher. Its not your typical english class where you read some old poem and analyze it in a paper. He assigns topics that are interesting and actually affect us.
5,best chem professor for 150 easily. tests are harder than the other professors but she's such a good lecturer that it offsets it. she also provides the opportunity for a 5 point bonus each test that helps a lot. you have to work but she makes it worth it.
2,McGill is a nice person  but her lectures won't help you at all for the tests. Brace yourself for a lot of self-learning and self-studying you will have to do. The tests will. wreck. you. But Aleks  Learning Catalytics  attendance  and participation will really boost your grade at the end of the semester so good luck.
3,Mcgill is going to be a hit or miss for all of her students. Her style was very much pose a question and watch students struggle even if they were going in the wrong direction before explaining the right answer. AKA very roundabout in her teaching. If you take her I highly recommend getting notes from students who have already taken the class
3,Excellent lecturer  gets you engaged and makes sure you leave class having learned something. Attendance is mandatory but you don't have to participate. Unfortunately  she has ridiculously difficult exams and a luck-based bonus system  which drags down your GPA. Other professors for the same course will have easier exams.
5,One of my favorite professors at Emory. Really awesome lectures that I actually enjoyed going to and fair albeit difficult tests.
2,Uses the reverse classroom
4,Chem is hard to begin with  but McGill teaches it well. She doesn't have the traditional powerpoint with bulletpoints  so you're really going to have to do her worksheets and pay attention. Do all resources given(chem mentors  office hours etc) I had friends in Heaven who had basically the same test as us  but they never really learned the material
4,Chem is difficult but doable. Use all resources: office hours  EPASS  Chem Mentors. Great lecturer. Kind person. Helpful at answering questions. Enthusiastic.
1,Do not take this class unless you can teach yourself!!! She does not curve  and is unapproachable. Do not believe the stuff other people say. This class ruins your GPA and she has it out for pre med students. I went to Epass  never missed class  & studied 15 hrs a week. If you took AP chem and are smart take this class if not avoid it at all cost.
2,So I'm not actually a pre-med kid (or even in STEM at Emory) but I do spend a lot of time in the (organic chemistry) side of things and from what I've seen she's a nice person  but her tests are insane. Not worth it  she'll ruin your GPA freshman year. Take literally any other gen chem prof  you won't regret it.
5,She is a really good lecturer  but she goes so fast
3,She's really nice and gives good lectures  but she gives really hard tests that will kill your GPA.
5,Exhibits a genuine love for Chemistry and cares so much for her students! And she's Canadian so you'll learn a lot about that if you take her class. It's a definite PLUS!
5,She's amazing. Really helps you understand the concepts of general chemistry with a little bit of organic mixed in. She made me a chemistry major! Go to chem mentors and do the class worksheets and it's not hard to get an A.
4,Dr. McGill is very sweet and willing to help if needed. Her office hours are very helpful. The content is difficult but reading and chem mentors really helps. For fall 2017  McGill and Williams will be the only ones with experience teaching the new course  Chem 150  so take them!
3,Dr. McGill is a great professor - I really liked how she taught. However  the orgo material is extremely challenging so beware - the incorporation of orgo really made me work for my grade (btw  she is very unwilling to curve your final grade...) make sure to work hard in the beginning to get grades that can help you when the material gets hard....
5,I had Dr. McGill for Chemistry 141 and 142 and her courses this year were the pilot courses for the new Chemistry 150 and 2nd semester course. She did an amazing job of creating the new curriculum and taught it amazingly. She cares so much about her students and was so helpful during office hours. Take her if you want a good grade!
5,She was an amazing professor who really took time to listen to her students. The class will require reading and includes a lot of organic chemistry as this semester she taught the pilot curriculum which is becoming the new Chemistry 150. It is a lot more focused on fewer topics and will help to prepare students for Organic Chemistry for sure!
3,Dr. McGill is very nice but her class can be very challenging. She offers extra credit for groups if the group average is above an 80. The class consists mostly of group work on worksheets rather than actual lecture. It was sometimes unclear what chapters we should be reading. Generally we ran out of time before we could go over worksheets.
5,I took McGill because I heard that she makes you understand concepts instead of just memorizing equations or facts  and I wanted to challenge myself. It's true
4,Very sweet and funny lady. I would recommend her to anyone  but you have to pay attention. At all times. You have to read the study guide to support answers on assignments. Test are hard if you do not study  so study with all your life. Like. Everyday.
1.5,very hard teacher doesnt explain well and tests you get slammed you study so much but never know whats on the test. very hard class dont know if ill survive this semester
3,She is really hard! She writes the textbook she uses and expects you to know just as much about the subject as her!
5,No Comments
5,So far she seems cool. makes the class fun and upbeat! as far as work i dont know yet its only been 2 weeks? so we'll see. but she really is FUNNY!
4.5,Lots of homework for the labs and you need to study every day to keep up and be ready for test. Take good notes. Do all the extra credit. Tests are very hard. You will learn so much. Excellent teacher.
2.5,her labs are relatively easy she does help you with them but you better get extra credit because when time comes for a test you get slammed. Even if you study you can have 4 chapters from the book and 3 chapters from the lab you have to know/ alot of the
5,Dr. Stecker might be the best philosopher on campus. But note that that doesn't entail he has the best pedagogy. I recommend visiting him during office hours. He'll give feedback on papers  and he's often willing to have discussions. He seems to want his students to be the best philosophers they can be.
2,Dr. Stecker's class is really hard to pay attention to because he talks very quietly and is not very engaging. He also grades pretty tough too  but its not a bad class.
1,Often hard to understand because he is constantly mumbling and even confuses himself on various topics
5,Love this professor! Always willing to help and very easy to understand  you'll definitely enjoy his class and learn a lot. Very little homework. Would take another class with him in a heartbeat!
4,Professor Stecker is probably the cutest and sweetest professor at CMU. He always cracks jokes and though you can't read his handwriting  he tries his best. He assigns readings  but usually hands out kind of confusing notes that go along with the readings. The quizzes & essays are directly from the notes he gives you. Overall a great guy!!
4,Professor Stecker is one of the sweetest professors you could ever get. He loves the material  he cracks jokes  and he does a lot to help you out and also get to know you. As far as the class goes  he will assign a reading  read it before class to get the basis of knowledge and the next day he will go over it with you so you understand.
2.5,Professor Stecker was very knowledagble about philosophy  however if you don't need to take the class don't take it. He gives you handouts with everything you need to know  but classes were very dry and boring. He had no clear scheduale and papers had no comments.
3,Cute little old guy  very nice  funny  not hard  just have to show up and engage in class
3,The class was mostly discussion and lecture based. The topics were fairly interesting  and he made handouts of all the information we needed to know. Quiz and exam questions come straight from his handouts. He's not a very tough grader  and he's not the most interesting professor either  but the class was very easy.
5,Prof. Stecker is really chill and he definitely takes time to explain anything relevant to the discussion that you don't understand.
3,Nice guy. Not an easy class. Don't take if you don't have to. Class is boring but he is helpful if you ask for help.
2,He is a nice guy. Not the best class. I wouldn't recommend the class but if you do the readings  study and pay attention you will be okay. Grades hard on the papers.
4,The class is very boring at times when there is no class discussion taking place. He will go out of his way to help you out when you need it and it helps that he even has a sense of humor!
2,I could not seem to get an A with this guy on any of my papers. I think its because I went against all of his personal beliefs. He is kind of creepy and you will not be able to stay awake during his class. Don't bother studying for the quizzes because he tries to trick you anyways. I never did open the book and i ended up with a B.
5,This class is a little boring  but he is really nice and knows what he's talking about. He gives you printouts of the notes so study those for the quizzes & you'll do well. There a 2 papers and the midterm and final are take-home essays and he lets you email a draft to him which is helpful. Go to class and participate in lecture and its an easy A.
1,I don't know where to start with this class. You sit in your chair and you bang your head against the wall for 75 minutes. Very boring and dull. Stecker is a nice guy and helpful  but the material he covers doesn't really help you. If you participate in lecture  you should be alright. The quizzes are misleading.
3,It was really boring. I did EVERYTHING I could think of to stay awake in that class and never could. The quizzes were horribly misleading because of the way they were phrased and he seemed to prefer the papers I wrote the night before they were due to the ones that I worked on ahead of time. But he was always willing to help during office hours.
4.5,Took this course as an honors class. Wasn't that bad  but he can be a bit of a hard grader on the papers. Make sure you do the readings and don't miss quizzes and you'll be fine. He's a nice guy with a good sense of humor and will help you out.
3.5,he is really hard to understand at times  mumbles  but overall  great humor and very interested in material. made the information quite interesting! i would take him if u need PHL....
2.5,He is very boring and enjoys listening to himself talk. Instead of discussing the philosophy articles  he would just ask students what they thought. So no one learned anything. He is a nice guy  but his class is super boring. Only 2 exams (midterm and final both take home) and two other exams. His quizzes  although only 10 questions are misleading
5,Outstanding instructor. She is just a delight. Brings a wealth of knowledge and a spirit of genuine helpfulness to the class. She is one of MU's stars!!!
4.5,Dr. Townsend is strict on her papers  but if you're a doctoral student - YOU SHOULD BE HELD TO A HIGHER STANDARD! (in reference to a previous rater's comments) She is insightful and does a nice job of adding application to the course.
5,Dr. Townsend is great. She's an actual educatator. You have to read. You have to write well. You can't get away with sloppy work. She holds students to a professional standard. That's my tuition dollars at work. I'm not interested in an easy A.
1,Former English Teacher
4,"quick 2 question quiz every friday. 15% of your grade is participation!!!! Dont bother buying the textbook  I never opened mine!!!! For any open ended question he asks in class  answer ""IT DEPENDS"". 99% of the time you'll be right! midterm and final are questions very similar to the quizes! Take clear notes!"
4,No textbook necessary for this class. Ghorashi lectures the entire class which can be boring but he is very clear and always asks if everyone understands because all test and quizzes are based on notes taken during lecture. He revisits previous lessons at the beginning of class. A quiz every week  midterm  and final  rarely any homework.
4,Quizzes every Friday  based on solely what was gone over in class  and then a midterm and final. As long as you pay attention in class  participate a little  and do well on the quizzes and tests  you're good. He's a good professor and makes sure to go over concepts a lot and see everyone understands.
5,He is a great teacher for Intro to Microecon. He spend around 5 minutes every lecture going over what was learned previous lecture. Because of the repetitiveness of his lecture  it's hard not to learn the concepts. Important thing is PAYING ATTENTION in his class  because you only have his notes to refer to  since he doesn't really use the book.
5,Very interesting and relevant teacher. Fair grading  clear and concise while explaining the topic. Makes sure everyone understands before he goes on and encourages questions.
5,Professor Ghorashi is an awesome guy. He asks about what news is going on and lets us discuss it for a while and then says well  I'll go into economics now. He's really funny and his sense of humor is awesome. If you show up and take notes and listen  the quizzes are easy. No textbook needed. He also encourages questions because his accent is heavy
5,Ghorashi was perfect for Micro. I can see why his other courses may be more difficult but he taught micro excellently. He is passionate  very worldly and knowledgeable. I was I had been on time and attended better because he takes self phone use and attendance very seriously. He is hilarious and committed to making sure you understand the subject.
2,I didn't know what he was teaching or grading on  and i don't think he did either. At the end of the year  i feel like he just gave everyone a B and moved on. The class was fine if you don't mind not learning anything.
1,He's really knowledgeable about the subject  but he's absolutely awful at teaching it. At the end of the class  I had no clue what he was trying to teach. He didn't even tell us there was a final until like a week before the exam. If i didn't need this class for my minor  i would have dropped it in a heartbeat.
1,Ghorashi is a nice enough guy but the class was awful. Being in the class was agony  nothing but student presentations and meandering  pointless lectures by the professor. He didn't really explain any of the homework or projects  finishing his assignments felt like guess work. Honestly  I don't even know if he knew what he expected us to do.
2,"So much pointless busy work. weekly journals every week  15 extra homework hours of ""research""  two 20 minute presentations  and basically none of it was necessary. I have no idea what this class was supposed to be about."
1,Worst teacher ever!!! There is no syllabus or a need for a textbook. Half of the time I feel like he makes up things as he goes along. No midterm or final but weekely journal articles and 2 20 minute presentations on pointless topics. Very hard to understand him as well. Avoid him at all costs.
1,I really wish some other professor would teach Intro to Global Studies. I was forced into taking Ghorashi for my minor. His lectures were rambling and vague. 90% of the class time was spent doing 20 minute presentations that weren't explained very well. Honestly  they just felt like an excuse for him to have us teach the class instead of him.
4.5,Such an amazing professor. Related everything to the real world  and really engages his students with his humor and animated way of lecturing. He always makes sure everyone understands each lesson & will go over everything as many times as needed to help you. Take good notes and review for quizzes and you will do great!
5,Ghorashi is challenging  which is probably the reason for the negative reviews. That said  if you make the effort to follow his lectures  take notes  and study outside of class  you will find that he is really skilled in taking very difficult concepts and breaking them down. He's also able to lead students to an answer without giving it outright
1,This class was absolutely miserable. There is no clear syllabus and or curriculum. Two twenty minute presentations or a 12 page paper. So tough on grading and shows little respect for his students. I dropped my minor because of this. Do not take this class.
1.5,This professor seems like a nice person  but his class is miserable. No clear curriculum  lectures are confusing and make no sense  pain in the butt about attendance and participation. Literally nothing makes sense in his class. He seemed to play favorites. Gives out B's and B- . I am trying to avoid any of his other classes.
5,Professor Ghorashi is an EXCELLENT professor  if you are a decent student. He cares about whether you learn so he requires active participation and studying. If you do this and are careful to take very good notes in class  this course will be easy. Taking good notes and paying attn in class is key to doing well on exams.
2,We don't use the textbook he made us get. There is a quiz every week with open ended questions  not easy. I missed class because I had a bad cold and I emailed him asking him what homework I needed to do and he refused to tell me and I got a 0 for it. Picks on you if you look tired even if you're paying attention. You never get out of class early.
3.5,Ghorashi is a very good professor. Economics is a challenging subject nonetheless. If you commit to understanding the concepts rather than memorizing you can do well in his class. There are only 3 exams so make them count there is very little chance to get grades elsewhere. There is no homework!
5,I took his astronomy class about 6 years ago  so I'm not sure if he still does it. Very interesting guy who knows his stuff. Probably one of the best I had. His tests are difficult  but if you study hard  you'll benefit from the curve. He got me interested in start gazing and astronomy. The observatory trips were great  especially the extra ones in the middle of the winter to look at the meteor shower.
5,Great guy. Tests are difficult  but he does curve to make it fair. Knows his stuff and the observatory trips are great!
5,Very cool guy. An adjunct who has a love for astronomy and shares it with the students. Hilarious. Lectures can drag on sometimes but he is very well informed and clear. Takes people out to the observatory to observe the stars. Great guy  great class
5,Dr. Thielen was extremely intelligent and provided us with all the materials required to pass the class. His lectures were also thought provoking and entertaining.
5,I took this class as a hybrid class and really enjoyed it. The class consists mostly of reading through the teachers slide shows and writing down information on a paper you could use on tests  which took a lot of time but helped me really succeed in the class. The teacher was very nice also!
5,Professor Thielen is an amazing person. He gives good feed back and his presentations are very informative. You really only need the book to for a few questions on the tests that don't reference his slides. I took this class online and had a blast. If you need to take a communications class take this class with this professor. You won't regret it.
4,Professor Thielen is a good teacher and just a good person in general  his lectures are interesting and he cares about his students. There was a lot of reading and homework but I was in his hybrid class. Show up  do the homework and study for the tests and you'll do great.
5,Dr. Thielen is awesome. He does such a good job at engaging the students in interpersonal comm. He gives you every opportunity to make up lost points with multiple extra credit options. If you don't do the work you won't pass but you will have ample time to do it and its very easy work. I would take this class again  thats how good it was.
5,Dr Thielen is a true gem at Pvcc! Took his interpersonal communication class and it was amazing. His lectures are interesting and he wants you to participate. He is very clear and appreciates his students' hard work! Would defedentley take his class again!
5,His class is very fun! Took his hybrid class  so we met once a week. All the material was online on canvas. He gives a notetaking guide that correlates to each slide in his presentations and you can use that cheat sheet on the exams! You can also fill the margins with extra notes and it's okay. Loved his class :)
4,He's an amazing teacher! At first I thought the class would be very boring but as the semester went on the class became very easy as long as you pay attention! The tests are exactly like the review  it would be very hard to fail this class.
5,Was nervous about this class  but I found it to be one of the best classes I've ever taken. Thielen is organized and wants to provide a class environment where student can learn and be successful. He works EXTREMELY well with hard of hearing students or disabilities. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TEACHER and would take him again for sure.
5,Professor Thielen was awesome! He allows you to use your study guides on the tests  making them 100x easier. If you don't like purchasing textbooks find someone who can share theirs with you  you WILL need it! You might get some last minute cancellations and he allows you 3 unexcused absences but he makes class interesting enough. I recommend him!
5,Dr. Thielen was probably the best professor I've ever had at PVCC. He is helpful  considerate  and SO clear in his direction. I learned a lot from his class. He comes highly recommended  as long as you're willing to really do the work  read the book  and study for the tests.
5,Mr. Thielen was an excellent teacher. The subject matter was not to difficult. He made coming to class a joy. He is very charismatic  and you can tell he enjoys what his work.
5,He lectures were entertaining and eye opening. There is a fair amount of homework in the class and must read the textbook if you want to do well in class. That was my problem I just listened and took notes on Powerpoints but didn't read text book like students who recieved a better grade than me
5,Great instructor. States clear objective every class. Very organized and enjoys what he is doing. If you show up you will pass. Easy course.
5,Great Teacher  fun class  homework is not hard and gets easier after you do it a few times  one of my favorite classes I have ever taken.
5,I cannot say enough about what a wonderful teacher Dr. T is! He's incredibly nice  very helpful  & he makes what could've been a very dry subject a fascinating one. I always looked forward to his class & will jump at the chance to have him as a teacher again. The class is not hard & there really isn't that much work to do. Fun class  fun teacher!
5,Seriously one of the best teachers I have ever had. Not only does he know communication  he practices all of the lessons in his lectures. I will be watching for other classes he instructs in the future to register for those. Be prepared though
4,Really awesome teacher!! You can tell he REALLY loves what he teaches.. Class is pretty easy just do the journals..and you get to use study guides on the tests!
5,Dr. Thielen (Tee-Lynn) is an amazing professor! You can tell he really enjoys what he does. I'm so glad I had him for a teacher. The class is very interesting  never a bore and the work level is moderate
4,Dr. Thielen (tee-lynn) is easy to understand and very organized. I was in his hybrid class and his presentations were easy to follow and understand. The book is used heavily as you have to write a discussion paper every two to three weeks. The tests  taken on scantrons  aren't too difficult  but fair and occasionally have funny suggested answers.
4,Great professor
3.5,Prof was great! He was interesting and funny. The lectures went quickly. He spoke quickly so keeping us was important  but the class itself was fairly straightforward. Wish he wasn't retired now.
1,One of the most arrogant professors I have ever had. Some of the most confusing lectures I have ever had was with him. Apathetic towards his students. He is now retired.
3.5,Very interesting lectures  never boring. But sometimes speaks too fast  and hard to keep up with notes.
3.5,He's a fantastic history prof who doesn't approaches his lecture with a bit of a sense of humour.
4.5,Awesome Prof! Speaks quickly in lecture but if you pay attention  the lectures are very informative. a lot of essays  but they are intended to improve your writing for your future university career.I would love to take another class taught by him.
3.5,He tends to rush his lectures  and it can be pretty hard keeping up. His style is rather theatrical  but he reads off his paper in front of him which sort of detracts from it. I LOVED him the one time he covered for our TA. Laid back and with no notes  he joked around  answered questions  and imparted lots of info. His lectures should be like that.
4,The best prof I have had at York. His lecture are fast-paced so it is best to have a laptop for taking notes. He presents the material in an exciting  often humorous  way. Be prepared to work hard. There are lots of readings and essays. Still  if you keep you with everything  an A+ is possible.
4,"Very interesting  ""Can you hear me in the back? OK! And thank you again for turning off your cell phones! Today we will be talking about..."" He goes pretty quickly but is easy to follow. Course is TOUGH for first year and it's to bad he isn't teaching it anymore."
5,Irvine was easily my favourite professor this year. The workload is not easy  but it's manageable if you put in the time. He's so funny  and seems very approachable. Doesn't seem to be arrogant like other professors I've seen. Exam was very fair and much easier than expected. Not a hard class if you're willing to put in the work  which most aren't.
3.5,Funny. Has a thorough knowledge and lectures with an inbiast opinion  especially on hot topics. I believe he's a pretty ideal professor.
5,A great class and a unique lecturer. Irvine's class really changes the way you approach studies in history.It's a tough class  but worth the learning experience. Recommended if you are serious about history
4.5,Haha  hotness level - zero. Prof. Irvine was definatly one of my influences to continue my major in history. I agree with alot of what was already written... he keeps the attention focused during lecture  keeps a fast pace  speaks with alot of tone and inflection  and tries to make jokes here and there. I loved the way he pronounced 'R-r-russians'.
5,Prof. Irvine is the best ever  I thoroughly enjoy every lecture  even the most boring topic is fun in his class. His dynamism also has considerable effect on you in lecture. Truly loves the material and is eager to talk with you before and after lecture  or even just around campus. In closing... TURN OFF YOUR CELL PHONES!
4.5,One of the few professors who can keep the attention of the class throughout  partly due to the need to write down so much of what he says. Interacts well with the class  through humour and catering certain lectures to student interest  if time permits. Extremely knowledgeable  and lectures are well-organized. Talks fast  and expects you to keep up
4,Such a dynamic teacher. You can really tell he's interested in what he's teaching. Very knowledgeable  and uses good examples to clarify. Talks at a relatively normal speed  not slowed down like many other professors. Very upfront about how this class will be challenging. Keeps class interesting with his enthusiasm. Keeps the class engaged.
3,TOUGH CLASS  IRVINE KNOWS HIS STUFF
4.5,I adore Irvine. Great lectures. He can even manage to make economics  the history lover's snore topic  fun! (Well  at least not terribly and dry and snore worthy.) I took his thrid year class too. All I have left to say is: Rrrrrrrusian Rrrrrrevolution.
4.5,I THINK HES ONE ONE THE BEST PROFSS AT YORK..his lectures are really clear and althouh sometimes some of the history topics might be really boringg..he makes them interesting and theres only one exam and its straightforward...no stupidness on it and its pretty simplee!!
5,I enjoyed his first year class (HIST1010) so much that I just had to take his third year one  and it was honestly well worth it! He is one of the best lecturer's around and funny as hell.
3,She's okay. Material is really boring and she doesn't help making it any better. SHE LOVES TO TALK. Hour and fifteen minute class and she talks the whole time. She'll tell you a million times her husband is a pilot and loves to boast herself and talk about all her research but the class is pretty easy if you just study the power points.
2,Loves to hear herself talk. Will get extremely offended if you use your phone in class  and will threaten to take your phone. The amount of work you have to do on some assignments for the amount of points the assignment is worth is completely skewed. Would not recommend.
5,Best professor I have probably had at NIU. Really cares about the success of her students and will go beyond to try to explain something. You have to work for an A but you actually learn a lot in this class.
5,Best professor by far. She is one of the few that truly cares about the well-being of her students. As a result  she devotes considerable time and effort into improving her students and preparing them for life after graduation. She is also extremely approachable. I am a better person because of her.
5,Best professor by far. She is one of the few that truly cares about the well-being of her students. As a result  she devotes considerable time and effort into improving her students and preparing them for life after graduation. Many students mirror these sentiments  but some do not truly realize how much she has helped them until later down the ro
5,"Dr. Mcfadden is an excellent professor. She goes out of her way to ensure students learn the material. The cases in this class helps with real world application. There is a team research paper that further enhances your learning. There are 2 tests and one non-cumulative final. An ""A"" is attainable but you must work for it. Overall A+ Professor"
5,Helped me grow as a student and was really one of the best teacher I've came across at NIU.
5,Great Teacher. Class will require some work but not too bad.
5,Dr. McFadden is one of the high knowledge teachers I've came across in my college career. She has a passion for teaching the students and genuinely wants you to learn and succeed. She enjoys the topic and you can tell it is her passion. Most of the real world experience she draws from is in healthcare and aviation. One of my favorite NIU professors
4.5,relates to what you need to know in the real world.
4.5,AWESOME!!!
4.5,Enjoyed the guest speakers and class activities. Applies to real world. A bit of work but fair.
2.5,Class is easy until the final a lot of math problems that are hard never take both of her classes at once it is unbearable!! she has no understanding that students have other classes in addition to hers she is arrogant and mean not approachable
1,If this is the only class you have she is great! But most likely that is not the case. I had more homework in this class than all of my other classes combined! She thinks she is the best person in the world  always brags about her being on CNN. She also talks about airlines like there the best thing in the world and bashes the healthcare feild.
4.5,The class itself isn't too bad. 10 cases  3 exams (last exam is extremely card due to calculations)  and one final project. The class would have been enjoyable if it wasn't for the stupid GA. The GA loves marking answers wrong & never gave anyone in the class a perfect score for a case/assignment.
2,Exact same structure as 442 - 10 cases  paper and presentation. Class is not hard  listen in class and take notes in packet. Pop an addy and memorize her study guide and you'll at least get a B. Pretty easy grader on paper. cases = waste of time  don't buy book just snap a pic of the cases.
2.5,She is not a bad teacher but she does things that really annoy the students.She is that teacher who wants to keep you until the last second of class and loves to hear herself talk. She takes about a month to grade anything.She wants to give out all these assignments and try to grade tough but can't even grade them within a decent amount of time.
1.5,She seems very nervous when reading her notes word for word. Theres long awkward pauses. She just really needs to learn how to teach not how to read to us. She giggles randomly which gets very annoying. She only wants you to memorize info. Someone please help her! The world doesnt revolve around just healthcare airplanes memorizing!We need to learn
4,Workload was above average. Class time was a lot of lecture. Too much time spent on weekly group presentations. Dr McFadden really wants students to get it and she is very (VERY) passionate about quality. Lot of memorization. Not an easy grader  but if you put in the effort you will get the 'A'. Textbook needed for HW. Could share.
2.5,She has ok teaching style but her grading is absolutely horrible - I have a 79% and she still give me a C. Mostly it is the TA who grades the materials and she doesn't even care about your grade. AVOID IF POSSIBLE!
5,Lee Grenci Taught me well. His classes were interesting  valuable for those who want to use the knowledge in their daily life. This information helped me during my career  with traveling  picking places to live  dealing with climate and understanding changes in climate and how the weather patterns affect us all. I am grateful to this man.
1,This guy is impossible to understand online. He gives more info than what is needed. He could get to the point but dosn't. Don't take this class unless you want to work 10hrs a week on it. Every class i have taken is easier than this one  far easier.
3.5,Good guy but missing a few good teacher qualities. Great ways of explaining things  but thinking of a concept slightly differently will be ridiculed. He expects high levels of thinking even for basic ideas. His grading is overly particular and will nickel and dime you to a lower grade. Past his corny jokes  ego  and aformentioned points  he's ok
4.5,Can not belive this course is a 100 level course. Lee is great  but the course is definately not 100 level material. I have sailed through some 400 level courses that didn't compare to the level of difficulty in this course. Avoid it if you can.
4,Not too bad... Corny but funny.
2.5,Class becomes impossible second half...To much for a Gen Ed. Should be called meteo 450...DONT TAKE METEO 101
2.5,The material is hell to understand. The best advice if you want a good grade is do your best in the first half of the semester. The material the 2nd half is horrible. Also  the 4 project grades are a big part of your grade. Take your time and get all the points you can from these.
3,This is the hardest class I have ever had. If you are planning on taking this as an online course  be ready to work 8 hours a week. Really tough course. Not suggested..
4,Grenci was really enthusiastic about the course. However  i found the online course to be quite challenging for a gen-ed requirement. If you are willing to put in a few hours a week and give an honest attempt you can be successful in this class.
1,Meteo 101 is hell.... Lee Grenci is the devil.... don't take this class
3,This class was wicked hard and since it was a stupid online world campus class  we weren't allowed to meet with him to ask questions....this class blows
5,Great teacher  keep up the good work Lee!
4,Tuff class alot of work...can reuse later in life.. if you put the work in the grade will show it...
4.5,Demands high quality work  knows his stuff  is passionate about teaching and wants his students to succeed. Has poor philosophical ideas and humor.
4,Sure his jokes were tasteless at times  but I learned a lot.
5,"I took Grenci's Meteo class and he was the best professor I've had. His class is fun  he makes it very easy to learn and his tests are cake if you go to his study session every week. As long as you show up and take notes  an ""A"" is in the bag."
2,I have never encountered someone so high on himself. Don't take this class if you plan on having time to eat and go potty. He's just gonna give you what grade he feels like anyway. I regret the day I selected this class.

5,She is one of my most favorite profs EVER. She's very warm and engaging  likes to teach the material in a fun and interesting manner. I'd gladly take many more classes with her!
5,No Comments
5,Class was appropriately challenging
2.5,The sources of material for her tests made studying kidna hard. Some was from lecture  some was from the book. about half hard  half easy to figure out what info she would test you on.
1,horrible class one of the worse i ever had.
3,No Comments
5,Aruguete is Awesome! She makes me wanna learn. All her classes are fun and interesting. If you want a good grade  you will have to study really hard  on the bright side  she is always in the office (office hours) and ready to help with understanding a lecture or your homework. She is great! Good job Professor! Keep on doing what you are doing!
5,Mara is number ONE!!!!
5,Mara rocked when I had her  but she's not at Stephens anymore  is she? Anyway  whatever  the class was wicked fun  and I learned a lot  but it wasn't particularly challenging. Not that I mind.
5,No Comments
1,I totally felt like she hated me for some reason. Everytime I walked into the classroom  I got a cold shiver and it wasn't the air conditioning. Her class was right after I got done student teaching everyday and she wasn't sympathetic at all when I came in right as class started even though I was NEVER LATE! Whatever  on the positive  she did have awesome clothes.
4.5,Awesome teacher. She is so full of passion.
4.5,very nice lady too bad she is gone
5,No Comments
4.5,Very good professor  class is fun and interesting. Has good examples.
5,Short Story was great with Colleen. She is really the cat's meow. Class was enriching but not hard. Doing the readings was fun. Two papers  one presentation  one small final...no sweat  but we still learned a ton about literature.
5,Colleen Whitley is so awesome! She is such a sweet lady and gives students a very fair chance. She is willing to help you ALWAYS. She changed my opinion about writing and she'll change yours too! Take her college writing class if you are interested in becoming a writer  she'll help you on the way.
1,I didn't like this class. Lots of busy work and subjective grading.
1,Not so good.
5,Class was easy and always interesting. You can revise your papers as many times as you need to get an A. Really cares about the students and what is going on in their lives. no tests  no final. most of the assignments can be used for honors graduation requirements. awesome teacher!
5,Colleen is an amazing professor! If you have the opportunity to take her writing class  do it!
1.5,"Her rubric is baloney. Do not make decisions based on her rubric. Make sure you do a good job on everything she might classify as ""a major paper"" and give the minimum on all the other time-wasting activities she assigns (journal writing and su"
4.5,Very nice and helpful. Excited about writing. She's concerned with you learning  not about grades. If you need a very structured  organized class  she's not for you.
5,One of the best classes I have ever taken.
4.5,she is incredibley helpful and does not give busy work. She works around the students srengths and helps out with the weeknesses. Shes been one of my favorites.
5,Prof. Whitley is awesome! I want to be exactly like her when I am sixty or however old she is. I love her class and would recommend it to anyone  especially if you like to write.
3.5,Had to buy a $65 book that was never used once! This lady is very nice though.
3,Nice lady  cute lasy. Really easy class... has little to no info about computer graphics  although she is extremely experienced and knowledgable. If you want to learn something  don't take it. If you want an easy grade  take it. DON'T GET HER AS AN ADVISOR! She'll let you down -- she never showed up for any meetings that were scheduled.
1,not a good advisor told me to take classes i know dont like
5,She's such a cute little lady. her classes are enjoyable and she is very helpful. She's is very creative with her projects. take her for anything possible
1,nice lady but bad advisor. she cancelled my advisment appointment and never returned my emails.
4,I loved her  def take this class!!!!
1,No Comments
5,Taking writing for the web with Dr. MCT and Ms. Joyce was the best idea ever! She's such a sweetheart. Very helpful and loves to hear your ideas. :-D
5,Knows her stuff! Loved class!! Learned more than ever thought I could.
2,Like everyone else in the department  plays favorites and punishes those she doesn't like.
5,Very easy and fun class. It's easy to get an A in the class and she keeps things interesting like having salsa dancing lessons. One of my nicest teachers.
3,She's a very sweet lady  but the class was rediculously easy and a waste of time. It was difficult to understand what she wanted at times. Wonderful lady  below average professor.
5,Margarita is great  very helpful and friendly  and makes class enjoyable.
5,i am obsessed with margarita!! shes is the best teacher in the spanish department. i love her! helpful  always willing to meet with you
4.5,Margarita is so sweet and makes spanish so much easier then other teachers.
3.5,She is really sweet but a bit quirky and made the classes fun!

5,He's a very kind  sweet man. People are critical of him for no reason at all. He's clearly bright  and he's enthusiastic even when others are not.
5,One of the more enlightened experiences I've had in the classroom. My writing improved to the point where I did extremely well on my GMAT ( 6 )  and I attribute that to Dr. Terry and my social sciences instructors. I want to emphasize that writing matters in all subjects  and Terry explains clearly regarding his standards and how to meet them.
4.5,Pretty great  I don't know why people have been critical of him. He tries really hard with my class even though 70% of them are either asleep or terrible and silent. So.
1.5,He honestly doesn't care about the student's opinions. He'll tell you that on day one. If you disagree with him  you're wrong. He has this habit of looking around with closed eyes  and then when he asks a question to stare at you incessantly. He grades like an English teacher. He's not. He's been reprimanded by the school before. <3 the subject tho
4.5,Took Women in Art  Impressionism  and Islamic Art. My writing improved greatly  and writing was emphasized as it is important to convey to your reader what something looks like  especially if the painting's or object's image is not available to the reader. I found that he is careful to explain how to write for his class with every single class.
1.5,This class was one of the worst experiences I have ever had. Terry likes to offend his students and throw temper-tantrums. Maybe for art students his class might be more enjoyable
4.5,This class does move rather quickley  it goes from the Chauvet Caves to Gehry's Guggenheim in Bilbao. Online quizzes fairly easy if you keep up on the readings  the midterm and finals are tough (lots of slide memorization) Many slides in ARH 101 overlap with 7 Pleasures
4.5,Excellent professor  knows his stuff  excellent sense of humor. Does expect students to have an open mind  show some interest in the subject  and spell check their papers.
1,for one he is not an english teacher but grades like it  but worse. plus he doesnt even care what you say just that it is his view of grammically correct  so boring and he gets in your face and is very rude to many ppl
4,He's a man who loves what he's doing  and his teaching shows that. The fact that he's so into it helped me to stay interested. A good man.
2,terrible class. worries more about his book then teaching the class.

4.5,Dr. Terry is a great teacher! Yes  he grades a little on the hard side  but I always learn tons in his classes!
4,Dr. Terry = love/hate. If you pay attention and show up (though he doesn't count attendance) you'll learn a lot. Where he lacks  however  is the tests. Often Dr. Terry's tests are insanely hard and he grades very strictly. Causal arty's could audit.
5,Terry is a great teacher. His classes are fun and very easy. He's really helpful and not boring at all. Art History with Terry is a great class to take  you'll learn alot of interesting things and it's FUN!!!
2.5,No oppinion  nothing speicial.
5,Fun guy  knows a lot about art history and classes aren't to difficult if you do the readings.
4,Prof. Yager is overall a good teacher. He can be slightly intimidating (esp. when in a small class)  but he tries hard to make connections with his students. There is homework every night  but it is never too lengthy or difficult
5,After taking Spanish-301 with Professor Yager  I took Spanish-331 with him a year later based almost entirely on the fact that he was teaching it. His class is relatively entertaining and he is great at connecting with his students. Genuinely cares about the well-being of his students and understands the students' perspectives.
5,Passionate guy  loves teaching Spanish  has been at the burg for three decades. As long as you put in the work he will be there to help you do well
5,Yager is the absolute best professor I've had on campus. He's super helpful  and you will learn a lot. Overall his class is easy  but his exams are brutal. Study hard.
5,Amazing. a blast of a class. take everything with him
5,I love Professor Yager! He's so funny  and I learned so much Spanish in one semester. You just have to try hard  because he only ever speaks Spanish even at the 100 level.
5,One of the best professors in the department! He really cares about his students and is a fair grader. He did require two hours of volunteering outside of class each week  but it was enjoyable. He knows what he's talking about and always wants to help you understand.
5,He's an absolutely amazing professor and very fair. Take him if you can! I learned a lot.
4.5,Prof Yager is amazing. I learned a LOT of Portuguese in one semester. Take him if you can.
4,The tests are pretty much impossible but he wants to see everyone do well in his class so he gives you lots of easy grade opprotunities... so don't waste them
3.5,Gives you a lot of chances to get a good grade by allowing you to rewrite papers or do community service for points
5,This guy is amazing. Lots of work but he really pushes you to do well and learn alot. Take him if you can!

5,This guy is VERY hot. He is a great teacher and ALWAYS makes class fun. I would also recomend you take this mans class!
5,Very nice guy and easy teacher. The work is not hard and he grades leniently.
5,Great GUY
5,Great man and the work is easy! Busy work but nothing that you have to put your mind to too much and he is a fair grader. DEFINITELY TAKE HIM :)
4,Lots of work  but well worth it. Good guy.

4.5,Professor Epler is a really helpful person. He makes sure you know what you are doing  which is great. I'm not the best with math  but he helps make it bearable.
5,I had him for pre-calc. He's a totally awsome teacher and everyone should take his class.
5,This guy was awesome. He would talk to himself at the board and always insult himself for doing something wrong. His class was great and for the first time I understood what the h**l precalc was about.
5,Excellent teacher  and it shows he still currently teaches high school. Problem Solving was the easiest math course ive EVER taken (and im a math major). I would honestly be surprised if there was a person in the class who got less than an A-. Easy course even for the math challenged!
5,Easiest math class i've ever had in life
4,No Comments
5,It's math  you have to work on it daily if you want to understand the concepts. This professor also created and posted videos of him teaching each lesson. Watch them and take notes and you will do fine. He is actually quite hilarious in the videos and makes learning less intimidating. There is extra credit and he helps anyone  just ask!
5,THE. BEST. MATH. TEACHER. EVER. he's very understanding  he loves teaching  and it matters because when a teacher loves to teach  students will actually understand better
5,I had him once a week for trig at night  it was not a good time  but he made the class lively. You really have to work for a good grade but he gives easy and useful extra credit  it isn't much but it could bring your test up a letter grade. Loves interacting with his students  will 100% talk to you at least once.
5,Very great teacher. Hes goofy and out there which is different from the average teacher. He makes up funny sayings and tries his best to relate math with real world examples. I was never bored in his class. He picks on everyone so beware and pay attention at all times. I would definitely recommend him. I wish I could take him for Stats.
5,Young is amazing! I suck at math but I got an A in this class (after getting a C in intermediate algebra which was taken online with an instructor that didn't always respond to requests for help in time for the test). For me  the A took quite a bit of intense work. Generous extra credit and fabulous DIY lecture videos were very much appreciated!
5,I've always been bad at math and after failing college algebra the first time I never thought I'd be able to pass this class. Bob Young cares about students and offers extra credit  amazing study tools online and in person  and other helpful tips throughout. Without his hilarious and effective teaching methods I wouldn't of passed this class.
4,I am terrible at math  yet I finished this course with an A. This was an online course - all assignments were open from day 1 of the semester so that students could work ahead. Extra credit opportunities for every tests. Professor Young WANTS his students to succeed. If you struggle in math  he will get you through!
5,Prof. Young is awesome! He really cares about math and his students. He offers extra credit on canvas so be sure to do that for some gimme points. Be sure to do the homework each week and his tests aren't really that difficult as long as you practice. Young makes math fun and is very funny! You will definitely enjoy his class.
5,I did not know what to expect going into this course however  Mr. Young did an outstanding job utilizing Canvas and MYMathLab to give his students a clear expectation even before stepping into his class. There are plenty of resources available  I am not the most confident student in math but he brings of the best in his students. Take his class!!!!
5,Professor Young is amazing! I have always had a hard time with algebra  I made a C in pre algebra even! I dropped college algebra three times before finding professor Young. He speaks math to where I can actually understand it. Couldn't find a better math teacher!
5,I took Mr. Young for College Trigonometry. You can tell right away that he really loves math and he really loves teaching. Trigonometry isn't easy for a lot of students but he really tries his best to explain everything as best he can. I've now moved on to Calculus and the fundamentals he taught are helping out a ton!
5,I'm horrible at math. I had to take all of the development classes and barely passed those. Professor Young is the best math teacher I have ever had. Yes  I made an effort to learn the material but he really breaks down everything and never makes you feel stupid for not knowing/remembering a concept. TAKE HIM IF YOU STRUGGLE WITH ANY TYPE OF MATH
5,Mr. Young is an exceptional teacher. He takes an interest in all of his students and goes out of his way to help you. He really makes math a fun experience. His class is the most social and friendly math class I ever took. Mr. Young gives extra credit opportunities  math handouts  and videos. I would recommend him to any student wanting to succeed.
5,As a student that usually struggles with math  Professor Young was great. I took him online  he makes instructional videos for every lesson that are a huge help. You can tell that he genuinely loves math and he explains it in a way that's easy for anyone to understand.
4,Mr Young is a great teacher. Unfortunately  i struggled with his class
5,Mr. Young is an excellent teacher to have for Trig! He teaches with enthusiasm and offers a lot to help students  especially during his office hours. Be sure to do your homework/practice tests on time!(Had to learn the hard way) Success depends on YOUR efforts  so don't be afraid to ask questions/go in for help. I would highly recommend Mr Young.
4.5,Mr. Young provides a relaxed classroom environment. He is a funny and bright teacher. He gives an extra credit opportunity before each test  most of which were just writing paragraphs about math site recommendations. He puts all his effort into helping his class succeed. Could not recommend him more!
5,He teaches like a kid that is excited for a present on Christmas but it makes a usually dull subject engaging. I had him in the morning and he was almost better than coffee for waking me up.
3.5,Great teacher!! If you struggle with math  he is the guy to take. He explains things well & it really helps. Unfortunately he wont be teaching stat or else I would taking him again.... College algebra is tough though  so brace yourselves.
5,Best math instructor at the college
5,Prof Leatham teaches in a way in which you learn or you don't. From the very beginning he makes it known you control your own grade. Lots to read but most readings are interesting. His style is relaxed  honest  invigorating  and he's most definitely a giver. Pays close attention to detail and is forgiving of fault. Hands down  def one of the best.
4,Professor Leatham is a very unique professor  I enjoyed his class very much. A lot of reading  lectures were always interesting and very good. He doesn't baby anyone and gets you ready for the real world. He tries to get you to really use your mind. He breaks the paradigm of professor in a great way. Too many complainers in his class.
4,really enjoyed this class. His lectures are messy but be an adult and organize the information to how it makes sense to you. Go to office hours for any extra help  he is really a sweet man and very excited to teach.
5,Can't recommend him enough! Go for it.
2,A student and 2 year assistant. I know WBL. Positive: Dr. Leatham offers passable classes. Minimal effort decent grade. Knowledgeable. Online reading and exercises mandatory. Negative: Egomaniac. Avoids questions. Lectures off-topic. Often late. Humor  problematic when the focus is personal. Be careful what you say. It will be remembered.
5,Professor Leatham is not your typical professor. He talks a lot during his lectures but he makes it fun and interesting. He had two exams and they were based on his lectures and on the readings. His exams were 10% of our grade. He gave A LOT of extra credit!
1,"His test have nothing to do with what he leactures about (if you can call it lecturing). Our final was about 112 question long. He tries to ""Stand and Deliver"" the class  but fails miserably. There is no organization! This class is not hard  but it adds so much stress to your life. You're basically in limbo the whole time with your grade. Stay away"
1,All he does is yell at us. I am a Bio Chem student in Calc 2 & obviously am good at studying and following the rules  but he makes the class so much harder. Just finished his class and I am still confused at what he actually taught. He is jumbled on his exams (2 number 49's on a scantron - not sure which one to answer) and he updates nothing.
1,His assignments are the definition of busy work. Not a hard class but time consuming. He's rude for a college professor. You do not know your grade until the end  and when you ask he will give you some long story about how grades do not matter. Doesn't use BB uses his own website which he never updates . I do not recommend taking him.
1,"Definitely the worst professor i have ever had in my entire life. ""you guys are stupid"" is just one of the many disrespectful things he would say to us. please hire a new professor! thank you professor leatham for showing me how NOT to be a teacher."
1,I took him for Geology 101  never again. I didn't learn anything about Geology in the class  waited outside of his office for a grade check and he never showed up. He also goes off subject a lot in the class and when he does talk about Geology it's very confusing. There are class evaluations due every class.
1,Leatham spends about 90% of the time rantings mostly trashing students and the way we want to learn or are accustomed to do things. He tries so hard to teach in a revolutionary way in terms of getting students to think for themselves. Really though  there is no class structure his assignments are crap. He was a week late in submitting final grades
5,Show up to lab  do all the chapters he tells you  make sure you turn in your evaluations each class  and do as much extra credit as you want (he literally has no limit you can do hundreds of points of extra credit) Easily my favorite teacher. Don't take what he says personally  he cares about his students and has trouble expressing it sometimes.
1,"Type of person who takes advantage of the fact that they have a captive audience due to students having to be there. Literally talks about anything he wants but geology. Always off topic  hair brained  and unprepared. He tries to hard to be a professor that teaches ""out of the box"" would highly recommend staying away from his class. Terrible."
2.5,It's a really confusing class at first. but once you get used to it  it's really fun. I learned a lot  most of it self directed. I learned how to be more inquisitive and self reliant. I enjoyed his class. There are no tests  but homework is due every class.
1,Dr. Leatham is the worst professor at CSUSB. He is very unorganized. He was 3 weeks late in posting our grades. He is very unclear. He does not speak nicely or respectfully to his students. His instructions and directions are very confusing. Worst teacher. DO NOT TAKE HIM! AVOID HIM AT ALL COSTS.
1,Discussion of previous class due each class. Group project was easy. Midterm/Final are extremely long and in depth. Gives a lot of extra credit  but you don't see your grade the whole time so who knows if it's actually applied. Extinction project is pretty easy. Rambles  strange  but cool. Winter break is almost over and grades still aren't posted.
1.5,"Very strange man. I felt the class was a colossal waste of time. He will go on a rant for an hour straight everyday of class. Just very tiring on the ears after a few weeks. Wants you to learn on your own but the ""material"" is non-existent. Basically you spend this class's work time on Google and Wikipedia."
1,He is very knowledgable about his field of study. However  he is very unclear about what he expects. He also talks about very inappropriate topics in class. He is an easy A  but not worth taking. He is very defensive and he gets upset because nobody participates even though he makes fun of us when we ask questions. Not a good learning environment.
1.5,First things first. I am not a lazy student and I do all my work. However  this professor is something else. He belittles you if you ask a question. He's very rude and curses all the time. He doesn't even teach all he does is show videos and talk about irrelevant things in class. Would never take again or would not recommend!
5,Most Brilliant mind I have ever met. Went from meeting you at 0 or any other place and took you to 100
5,"I love this man. He'll teach you how to think like a constitutional lawyer and construct a constitutional argument. He's a bit esoteric for some  but if you ""get"" what he's trying to teach you  and don't go in expecting a regurgitation of the text book  you'll get as much out of this class as you put in. Very different from your typical class."
4.5,Took him for Con Law. Highly recommend the course. His exams are tricky so be careful. Recommend reading Chemerinsky's Treatise along with class readings. If you are interested in judicial history he has some great stories. Oh! And check out his wine blog!
5,Baude is a living legend  a beautiful mind whose brilliance erupts in non-linear impressionist waves  mixing history & the law in a masterful melange. No  he doesn't give you an outline nor directly spoonfeed the info  as evidenced by some of the inane comments posted  but Baude is a true renaissance man  a gregarious genius who forces you to grow.
5,"If you don't think that Baude is the smartest person you've ever met. You've either met Socrates or you can't recognize genius when you see it. In the words of Terry Bethel  ""Baude knows everything!"""
1.5,Not bad
1,not the best
1.5,Smart guy and nice  but he just can't teach. I believe that he lets politics interfere with honest grading and teaching.
3.5,No Comments
1,I was assigned to take 3 courses with this fellow. He is very arrogant. Teaching method is unenergetic. I have no doubt that he is very bright - verging on genius - but who can benefit with that attitude of his?
3.5,Very bright guy. Fun to talk to. Very liberal  but fair.
1,I'll take two posts to describe this guy: he's got nothing but rocks on the brain  that's for sure. Designs some ridiculous course with no structure and throws out some ridiculous haphazard notes package for you to try and follow through. Not at all helpful  in class or in lab (labs  by the way  are weekday nights from 5pm - 8pm  what a joke)...
4.5,No Comments
5,John Hopkins changed my life. He's an amazing teacher and an amazing person. Yep  he's a touch teacher  but one of the most passionate and helpful profs I have ever had. Thanks for inspiring me.
1,This is ridiculous. He has no clue how to teach this class because all he does is lecture and you're expected to catch on EVERY ****ING MINUTE DETAIL.
1.5,His test are ****ing hard so get previous years test ie. go to the chem engg student society. The test questions are exactly the same kinda like econ201. He's bad at explaining things  main things in lectures are his research projects. Take PHYS369
1,Mean old man. Doesn't care about students. Cares only about himself. No course outline. Not very organized either
3,he is a nice man  and will try to help you although he gets frustrated easily. The material on his tests aren't hard  he just grades them WAYYY to picky  he will mark off 15 points for spelling errors  go over your test many times before handing them in  and everything on lab is on the test  but labs are easy!
3,Teaches from a physics perspective  not a exercise science or AT perspective. VERY picky on tests. Spelling  angles of vectors...those have to be perfect. Lecture and lab are fair game for tests  as is information and diagrams from the textbook. No suprises on the test  just information that's difficult to comprehend.
1,terrible teacher...does not teach at all  needs to retire!
5,Not quite sure why he has a bad reputation-simply go to his class (dont skip) pay attention volunteer when he asks questions. If you take the time to talk to him after class or ask him questions he's actually very helpful and a genuinely nice guy. His tests might be challenging but he's very straightforward about what you need to know-no surprises.
2,Take him in the summer if you can he's much easier then. Also two decimal places mean two (don't ever round off). Spelling always counts even supraspinatus.
2.5,Most difficult professor in the major. Not only because his courses are challenging but because he's so damn critical. If there's another professor available for the same class  take them.
5,Dr Ryan was one of the best professors that I've had. I do not rate how good a professor is by how easy they are. That said  he forced me to learn a lot of material that will help me with my career. You must study a lot for his class  but it definetly pays off. He is also very accessable and helpful if you have questions.
5,Dr. Ryan is an amazing prof. Always helpfull and down-to-earth. Fair in grading  and easy assignments.
4,I dont know what that idiot was smoking or on at the time he/she wrote that  but Ryan although a very nice man is ridiculous as far as exams. I dont know what this guy is thinking but he needs to understand that not every college student has countless hours a night to put in to studying towards his class. We have other classes as well
5,Dr. Ryan is AWESOME  he's always willing to help you out. He understands the student's needs. I loved him as a teacher!!!
3,Dr. Ryan is a definete overachiever. Out of all the FYRST classes  ours did the most work! The assignments were a little dumb  and very time consuming.
4,Dr. Ryan is a great professor  he is a really easy guy to get along with and talk to. the material in this class was boring  but he tried to make the best of it. I will def. take him for future classes
4.5,No Comments
2.5,Most likely the least helpful prof. I have ever had  gave tests which he openly admitted included subjects we had NOT covered in lecture....
4,A good professor whose very personable. I'd recommend him to another student interested in a course that he instructs.
2,BAD professor. Killed my 4.0 GPA! Nice guy but does trick questions on exams. Avoid if you can
2,Awful. Does not know how to lecture nor teach anyone anything. I studied and also had a tutor  I'll be lucky to get a high B. He teaches all application  so you have basically no idea when taking the test. I know ERS students cannot avoid him  but be prepared.
2.5,I felt really awkward asking him any questions because he's hard to understand. You get really easy points for quizzes and labs but the exams are only 20 questions so you really need to know the material. Tough to get an A  but he helps as much as he can.
4.5,He is monotone when no one answers his questions but loves participation and enjoys joking. If you pay attention in lab and lecture you will do great. The course packet was all I used...bought the book for nothing. He is very helpful in lab and gives you different ways to learn the material. All-in-all a great professor.
4.5,really easy course  had him for both lecture and lab. never any homework. he basically tells you exactly what's on the exams. final isn't cumulaive. he's really monotoned though so have fun staying awake.
4.5,Dr. Anning is a great teacher. His voice is monotone so it's easy to tune out but  he always takes the time to explain everything. If you need any extra help there are open labs at least twice a week where you can go and practice on the modles. He's willing to help you outside of class if you need it. He also gives tricks to remember the material.
4.5,Dr. Anning is a great Prof. he is monotone and loves to talk your head off but is also overly willing to help. He pays attention to the little details so take the time to cross your t's and dot your i's. There is no text book so you will have to keep track of your handouts  they are used for an open note final.
4.5,Great Teacher! The course pack is helpful and he gives his students multiple opportunities to learn the material. He makes practice worksheets for help and practice quizes. You know exactly what to expect. He doesn't try to trick you and genuinely wants you to learn. He is very fair and helpful.
4.5,Very Funny teacher. He also makes a good advisor. Very helpfull. Go to open labs when you can  read you book  MAKE SURE YOU KNOW YOUR SPELLING  and listen close(he does talk differently). You should be fine if you have him.
5,Great teacher! Really wants his students to get Anatomy! Just go to class and pay attention and do a little bit of studying before tests and you should be fine!!
3,This guy makes it hard to wake up at 8:00am. His monotone voice and relatively boring approach to teaching cause me to fall back to sleep almost every class. If you can  take applied anatomy with another teacher.
4,If you can get past the 8:00AM class and sit through his sometimes boring lectures  you'll do fine. Just keep up with notes. His slides are very helpful and the suppliment's amazing. He seems like a really great guy he just gets a little nervous. No homework - but keep up on your studies.
4,He is a pretty good anatomy professor. If you've never heard him speak before  be prepared-- this man needs speech therapy. Keep up with the studying for lecture b/c it will pile up. Lecture tests are easier than the other prof but you never know what will be on it  unfairly I think.
3.5,he is so not hot. i dont know what you're thinking. haha.. and he's so monotone! i sleep almost every day. hahaha
5,Amazing prof.
4.5,I had Dr.Anning his first year teaching at SRU. He's a really nice guy  willing to help. When I had him he seemed slightly nervous teaching in front of the class but if you talked to him one on one afterward he's a great helper and great teacher.
5,he's really nice and has a dry sense of humor. he uses repetition and cares if you understad the material. and i think he's cute
4,he is really helpful in labs  kinda hard to understand in lecture his voice can be kinda overbearing study your notes and color in your coloring book and you will do fine  very easy and useful information
5,he's so easy study your notes n show up to class n you'll be just fine  will give help if you ask  labs require some extra studying but he basically tells you what will be on it
5,As long as you do everything on Blackboard  show up for class (he gives points for you being there!)  and just study  you'll do juuuust fine! He's willing to help and there are always open labs for you to go to. Take advantage of those! He's great!
3,Dr. Lynn is a very engaging speaker but sometimes he is not always appropriate. During a lecture on ethics he made us pull out our phones and show him our Facebook pages. He said he wanted to check them for ho pictures. It is not his business what we do on our personal time. This was during a lecture on ethics.
5,Excellent professor. Humorous  lots of energy and makes class interesting. He is highly interested in ensuring that students understand the material in order to prepare you for the world after college. He will explain things a million times if needed. Take him if possible.
5,great professor...he will hellp anyone that asks
5,very funny
5,If I could marry one Slippery Rock professor  it would be Dr. Lynn!!!
4,he's a great teacher and he's willing to help if you ast... word to the wise.. dont get behind
5,I LOVE Dr. Lynn!He really seems to care when he helps. He'll sit and explain something to you a million times if he has to! He relates stuff to everday college things. Great man! By far one of the best teachers I've ever had!
5,Able to explain things well by relating them to the classmates. can tell he really knows and loves the information he teaches. wants you to understand everything so that you could also teach a class about it.
5,The class was easy if you attended and paid attention and if there wasn't anything you didn't understand he helped out as much as he could. Made class very fun and always interesting. Easily the best professor I've had so far at SRU.
1,started out invested  but then started acting like he really didn't care. he's dried up all ready!
1.5,he is very unhelpful and is the worst prof i ever had
4.5,Very interested in actually having his students LEARN...even if its not on the syllabus. He will gladly spend time to discuss topics related to the class (or exercise in general) if it will benefit the class and if its interesting for the students. Very available outside of class.

5,hes the best prof ive had here
5,"Very nice guy..very good teacher. He is enthusiastic. He is not in it to ""trick"" you. Very helpful  and knowledgable."
5,He's a new professor in this department. Thus far the course I'm taking seems simple. He's very helpful and still has that zest newer professors have before they dry up.
4.5,Fred Smoler  is by far one of the finest professors in SLC. I was a part of his class by complete chance  and was so glad to be in his class. Can't wait to take his alternate history class coming up this semester. He is a brilliant teacher and truly inspirational.
3.5,This was my *experimental* class  and I liked it  but it was a ton of reading. It was also difficult for me to focus in the lectures  it was a bit too much for me. I'm glad I took it  and I'm sure a seminar would be very different.
4.5,If you are a serious student  or even if you are a slacker  Fred will amaze you. Fred is the ideal professor to do conference work with. Several times I have forgotten to speak in class because I loved listening to him talk.
4.5,I took four separate classes with Fred  and he was without a doubt the single best teacher I've ever had at any level. He knows everything about everything  always has a book recommendation  can hold court for hours. Take whatever you can with him - particularly his more history-oriented classes.
4,Fred is a walking encyclopedia with a dry sense of humor. Anytime you hear a negative review  it's always from a student who couldn't keep up with him. He's a brilliant man who expects to be teaching brilliant students. The quintessential professor... a legend  and deservedly so.
2.5,Brilliant  scholarly guy. His seminars are really just lectures with fewer students  but he can be entertaining to listen to and you can learn a lot from him. Had trouble keeping up with what he said sometimes  though. Assigns TONS of reading--don't expect to get it all done. Be prepared for intense conference work.
5,Fred is like getting sparknotes on steriods - he is one of the smartest professors on campus and I've probably gotten more out of one of his classes than many other combined.
2.5,Well spoken and very smart  but has a gigantic ego. Group conferences were just mini lectures. Written evaluation is based only on the second class paper.
5,"It doesn't get any better than Fred. He's brilliant  hilarious  and can keep a lecture hall thoroughly stimulaeted. Deep-voiced  big on the tweed and the only person I have ever heard use the words ""polemical"" and ""****"" together in a sentence  Fred satirizes an archetypal professor"
4.5,It's very true. He's one of the best.
4.5,One of the best professors on campus
5,Great guy!
5,Prof. Sue is the best professor I have ever had. She is so willing to go out of her way to help students and make sure they succeed. You have to write 250 word papers each class  but they become pretty routine and are simple. She is very knowledge  but you have to come to class ready to discuss and listen. I would definitely recommend her!!
5,Sue is very kind and is always willing to help students. The class is very easy: you basically just write 350 word papers each week about the reading and talk about it in groups. The exams are written and there is a final paper and essay exam. Overall  the class is easy and definitely interesting even if you do not care for literature.
5,Dr. Sipple is absolutely amazing! Her discussions are always interesting and never fail to get me thinking. I love most of the books we've read and she brings up points that I wouldn't have thought of otherwise. In addition to this  she's super understanding and kind! I'd recommend her any day.
4.5,I love Professor Sipple. I have taken 2-3 classes with her and would take as many others as I could. She is very fun and engaging and she is super easy to talk to. She is willing to help you raise your grade and as long as you do your response papers and participate a little  she is very easy.
5,Best english professor at UCBA. Very helpful and provides good feedback with all of the papers. Total of three papers and a reflection letter.
5,Sue is the best professor UCBA has. Her knowledge is astounding and she communicates and interacts with her students in life changing ways. I would definitely take her if you get the chance!
5,Professor Sipple is an awesome professor! She is very down to earth  wonderful  positive attitude about life in general and sympathetic to the college student's life. If you need an extention on a due date she is very understanding. Extremely helpful and encouraging to her students  she wants us to learn and succeed. I definitely recommend her.
5,Great professor  you can write about really whatever you want in the papers. She's very open minded.
5,She's awesome! Sweet lady. Her class is laid back. You have 3 papers. You have a peer revision on all 3. Then you turn it into her for audio feedback...she gives great feedback! You have until exam week to revise all 3 papers for a final grade. I wish i could take her class again!
5,Sue Sipple is is witty  humorous  and easy to talk to. She is understanding if you have a good reason to turn in an assignment late. She makes everything clear. I would recommend her to anyone interested in actually learning something new.
5,Had her for Topics in Lit III: Holocaust Lit. She handled this topic with humility  understanding  and professionalism  even appropriate humor. Engages her students. A rare and exceptional caliper of teacher. Recently won a well-deserved award for her teaching. On sabatical now but will be back soon. An exceptional classroom experience! Yes!
4,I think she is a good professor. She makes me feel like she knows everything. I like the way she teaches the class. I liked her assignments and her audio comments. However  I think she is a hard grader.
5,One of the best English professors I've taken. She is very helpful and will answer any questions you have and she makes class interesting. Harder class though  it takes work and you have to write a response paper to every reading. Essay exams. Attendance is mandatory.
4.5,She's a true professional. Her class discussions are interesting and thought provoking and the material is interesting. You will have to write a short response paper to every reading and write a final paper. As long as you pay attention and participate  you will do well.
5,Best English class i ever took
5,Very very helpful but she grades very hard on the final papers. She is a great teacher but she does not tell you everything about your paper when you hand it in. In addition she does not tell you your grade through the entire semester
4.5,I took Sipple spring quarter in 2009. I really really enjoyed her class so I took her again fall quarter of 2009. She is a very approachable professor. Her classes are mostly discussion  but they're almost always interesting. She's also willing to look over and give advice on students' rough drafts of their final papers before they're due.
5,I had Sipple for English 101 and 103...I took her again for 103 because I really liked her. She was really helpful and let you go back and fix papers before turning in your final one. I highly recommend her. Especially if you are a strong writer.
5,Had her for Winter and Spring Quarter. Very nice professor and helpful as well. If I have a chance to take another class she teaches I will do so.
5,Impossible to not like her. Good: Doesn't talk down to students! Bad: Unfortunately  now I want her to teach all my classes. She is very likable and easy to talk to  and while she keeps the student/teacher line drawn  she's more like a friend than a teacher. Bad only because it's hard to not want to have her as a friend! Great person!
1,DO NOT TAKE ANY CLASS THIS MAN TEACHES... He is horrible and does not teach you one thing. He gave many people and incomplete in my class because he changed the date of the final with no warning and has refused to answer my emails or phone call. It has been almost 3 months and I still dont have a grade!!!
1,I past  but I cant tell you any thing about the class. I can tell you that Williams owns some property and some other personal things about him. Well  I quess the class was about him!!
1,CANT STAND HIM!He is the biggest bragger!He is unhelpful&doesn't make any effort for students-well unless you're the old lady in the front row that thinks she's 20-he does love to help her and addresses every lecture to her ONLY.Wms-stick to elem.Spec/Edu
1,THIS WAS THE WORST CLASS EVER! i had him 5 days a week bc i had 2 of his courses= omg. he still didn't recognize me  AND if you wanna just hear stories about himself and learn NOTHING...
2.5,Prof Douglass is one of a kind. I guess when you sign up for the class it says it's strictly a lecture. Must have missed the memo. The most boring class I've ever taken though. If you like to listen to a monotone voiced man speak for an hour straight then go for it. He does not use blackboard or handouts either. Only six grades for the semester.
4,Prof. Douglas really knows his info  it's obvious that he enjoys teaching. The class was strictly a lecture class  which is told on the registration website so if your expecting a hands on  exciting class  it's almost common sense to not sign up for a lecture course! Unlike much of the class  I attended every day and took notes. I got an easy A.
2,If you need history classes  do not take Douglass. He is not helpful. He is condescending. He doesn't answer questions clearly. The only grades for the semester are four book quizzes  a midterm  and a final. He grades very subjectively. Many times you don't know why he deducts points. I don't know of anybody who earned an A in this course.
1,"VERY boring class. Only lectures for the whole class and sometimes pass the class time. Monotoned  uses the word ""uh"" a lot. Avoid if you can! His quizzes and test have hardly anything to do with the notes  Google helped me! Decently rude and not very happy. You'll space out once he starts talking  its hard not too."
1,"The lectures are long  boring  and filled with information that you don't need/want to know. But attendance is mandatory. He gives 6 ""grades' for the semester but his grading scale makes no sense. Doesn't use email/blackboard at all. In a 55 minute lecture that ended 5 minutes early I kept a tally for every time he said um. It ended up being 453."
2,Prof Douglass seems to have social awkwardness which everyone seems to define as 'bad'. He seems very particular about his notes and wont defer. If you have a question he is notorious for saying 'it is in the syllabus' and then wont answer. Wasnt hard work  was hard to figure what he wanted. He is monotone  just reads notes  very dull class.
1,Avoid at ALL COSTS!!!! He is a very rude and boring old man. His test has nothing to do with the material. 55 minute lectures feel like 55 days. Honestly if his class is the only class that makes you a full time student it'll be better to stay part time.
1,Not a great speaker. We didn't use our class book at all. Required reading is a big part of this class. Lectures are long and boring. He seems awkward and says um 100 times per class. Take another professor.
1.5,He is very monotone and not very helpful. Only test grades and a lot of reading.
1.5,The worst lectures to be present for. So monotone and boring. Asks if there are any questions and then acts like you are inconveniencing him when you actually do have one. I would never recommend his courses to anyone.
3,Mr. Douglass knows his material  and could make it very interesting.However there is no room for converation...straight note-taking class. If you like to write  this is the class for you. It's all essay  and memorization! Good Luck!
1,Professor Douglass is the worst professor I have ever had. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS! Attendance is mandatory  (you get three skips  then he says you fail the class)  hard to understand  doesn't use blackboard or power points  never smiles  need I say more? Find another professor so you actually have hope of passing History and not having to retake it!
1,What ever you do  DO NOT take this class! Prof. Douglass is so unbelievably rude  does not care about his students and acts like it is such an inconvenience if you ask him a question. Does not respond to emails and doesn't make Black Board available. BORING lectures. 4 quizzes plus midterm and final. Read the book if you want a chance in passing.
1,One of the worst professors I have ever had. He doesn't even make blackboard avaiable so nothing is on there. He doesn't respond to his emails. He doesn't calculate the grades until the end of the semester. Oh and his class contains only 5 book quizzes  that is it. No other assignments or points. He just needs to retire because it's clear he's lazy
2.5,Douglas is a very monotone person. Lectures were boring and he never seemed like we wanted to be there. You read history novels as well as the textbook. Give a sheet that provides the exact questions on the test. The was probably the best part about him. Dreaded going to his class.
1,Very difficult to understand what he is saying. But he gives you s review sheet for each text/quiz and if you follow that you'll pass. I don't even listen to what he lectures becuase more than half will never be on a test.
1,very difficult to understand and did not make the class interesting.
2,He was boring to an extreme. Not to say he did not know his stuff  because he did. However  he tells you everything. Details you do not need to know or care to. He speaks slowly and tends to repeat nouns instead of ever using pronouns. Was just slow and boring. NOT RECOMMENDED
1,When I read that Dr. Douglas was a good adviser it shocked me. Any time you visit it seems like he is inconvenienced. Along with that he couldn't even explain how to add a minor/certificate. Had no interest except to push for 12 credit hours (no faith in students' abilities). He should be thankful for tenure.
3.5,very old fashioned style. He was my 1st intro back into college after 25 years. I love Amer. history  so this helped. He never smiles and I even asked him if he enjoys teaching. Tests are all essay  timed and hard. But if you study and read you will do well. Hot room  monotone voice  no discussion = drink lots of coffe to stay awake.
1.5,HE IS THEEEEE BEST STATS TEACHER IN ALL OF UC!!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND HIM!!! :) :) :)
4,Very helpful.
3,He has a few 'senior moments' but theirs 3 tests and you need to study from the book and do the problems  o you will have problems. I would recommend him.
2,I don't recommend you take this professor for Business Stats in the summer...he is unclear about the information given in the class. He may be better in a regular quarter!
5,attendance isn't mandatory just necessary to to understand and pass. he explains things better than the book and he doesn't put notes on blackboard
3.5,He is a very nice man  seems interested in helping. Sometimes he gets confused  and be sure to go over the tests! Makes several mistakes on grading.
4.5,Pretty easy goin guy. Tests are easy and he is always more than willing to help. I would recommend taking him to anyone!
1,He is so boring that it is everything I can do not to fall asleep in his class. He doesn't explain anything  so if you take him make sure you have a buddy in the class to get together with and study on your own.
5,Close your eyes and you'd swear Winnie the Pooh was teaching. A very caring and pleasant professor who makes sure you get through with a good grade.
5,he is the SWEETEST old man..he will do anything to help you out. fair and very nice!
4.5,Obviously loves history. This class is not an easy A  but you can do well if you go to class and do the reading. On the historical analysis papers  it's important to show that you understand why they are historically relevant  rather than just regurgitate them.
3.5,I got A's both quarters I took him so it is not impossible you just have to read the text. I enjoyed his class it was boring at times but you can tell he is trying and he really enjoys history. He is a little scary but once you get to know him he is actually very understanding. He was a lot better than any of the other history teachers.
4.5,He is a very good professor when it comes to learning but if you are looking for an easy class he is not it. He does not let anyone fail no matter how late an assignment is and he is always willing to help out when you struggle. He does have a mean side sometimes.
1.5,He was terrible  he just rambled on for his lectures. I read the textbook and still didn't do very good on the quizes.
1.5,He was terrible  he just rambled on for his lectures. I read the textbook and still didn't do very good on the quizes.
1,Horrible class!!!! You only were graded on 2 test and a paper. Both the test were essays and the paper had to be at least 10 pages long and that doesn't include the foot notes or resource page. He was a hard grader and he had his favorites in the class. I would never take him again.
5,Easy class if you do the reading and take notes. Great professor  knows his stuff and makes it interesting  relates it to current events. I will definitely take him again.
4,He is not my favorite instructor--but he isn't bad. He really knows his history! It is not an easy class. If you work hard  though  his class can be quite rewarding.
1,Horrible experience in his class. I felt like he did not want to help the students have a better understanding of the subjects. He just rambles on and on and thinks everyone should know what he knows about history before entering the class. Quizes are not easy like others might say...HORRIBLE
4,i took douglass and spraul-schmidt for the first two quarters  but cebula for the 3rd part of history sequence. i did the best in his class and felt i learned the most. multiple choice quizzes arent bad if u read  essay exams are challenging but just know major points of the chapters  i ended up getting a B in his class w/a decent amount of effort
4.5,Been a few years so see if his policy is still the same. A quiz each chapter - No Midterm - get an A average on the quizes and he'll use that in place of the Final - a long paper. Best class participation ever. Since quizes mean so much everyone reads and is prepared for class. I haven't been in a class since where I felt everyone took in so much.
3,Not a bad professor  tests are very hard  quizes arn't too bad if you read. Tests are Essay answers. Seems like he doesn't like to give out A's to students. He will ALWAYS find somthing wrong with your essays. Had to work pretty hard to get a B+ in the class. I wouldn't take him again.
5,I love prof cebula - he's such a great guy - the absent minded professor! Extremely intelligent - has great stories - hard quizzes  exams are challenging  but he grades fairly - he challenges his students to think - if you're looking for an easy class  go elsewhere - whoever said he's boring can't possibly care about the world@@
1,Boring guy!
4,He's a nice guy  kept me interested even with my lack of sleep. hard grader and tests are difficult  but still a good class and professor.
1,lots of lectures  boring lectures.... however fair grader
5,Boring lectures  easy grader.
3,not interesting...went into tons of boring depth.. quizzes sucked and exams sucked worse. not a fair grading policy.
5,Amazing professor. My favorite professor at BA and main campus. Super friendly and extremely encouraging. Easy A. Uses real life experiences in her discussions. Everyone is always involved in discusssion which makes this class so fun to go to. She cancels class frequently and cuts class short which sucks because I love this class so much.
5,She is very kind so it is really easy to talk to her about things that are unclear  she uses areas of her work to help explain certain topics better. Although it is easy to get an A in her class its just as easy to get an F if you dont show up or do the work.
5,Can use book/internet/whatever on exams. Check BB before class  cancels frequently. Also  dismisses early every day until end of semester. Child Development was an easy class with her. It's an easy A if you know how to write papers well enough.
5,She's a modern superwoman  juggling a PhD  a private practice  and some 3 classes? Extremely kind and easy-going. Very intelligent and thought-provoking. Always left feeling like my mind had expanded a bit. Tells great stories and examples. If I had met her earlier I'd probably pursue a career as a therapist. You get what you put in as always ....
4.5,Chd Dvlp at BA-enjoyed Grosser's class. Good at explaining--relates lectures to real life with interesting examples. Likes class participation. 2 exams are take home--based on textlectures. Helps to read text beforehand for exams. Exams --group. 2 observations --start early! 1 paper--again would start early in semester to choose topicresearch.
4,She was very nice and her class was easy enough. Two take home exams (that you'd need your book for) and three paper  all of which being relatively short. She does get a little sidetracked during her lectures  but not too much to not get through the notes. I would definitely take her other courses she's teaching if need be.
5,Take her class for an easy A. She gives lots of stories to keep you interested. Easy graders and doesn't rarely assigns homework. When she does  she gives you full credit just for turning it in. Very friendly as well.
5,AMAZING I LOVED MY INTRO TO SOCIAL WELFARE. SHE IS AN AMAZING PROFESSOR!!! : )
5,I took one psyc class in high school and learned nothing/one college class learned a litle.I learned so much from her i ab****ely love her class.She makes sure her students understand the lecture if they look puzzled she will explain it in a different way.And she made class enjoyable.The Tests and the projects are pretty easy. Highly recommend her
4,easy class  but learned something from it.
5,Awesome teacher  she's very knowledgeable  very experienced. Very easy. just show up to class and you'll get an easy A  she gives you take home exams basically open book  the final was open notes so  tremendously easy! You cant fail this class! You'll get out of class early almost every class..... she's awesome!
5,Great Teacher!
5,Smart lady  really knows her stuff. She does a lot of hands on learning and discussions. You usually get out of class early too!
5,Wonderful prof! Always got out of class early. Simple take home exams. And was allowed to use notes on final in class. Easy A!
5,Awesome teacher. Keeps class interesting. You can use notes on the exams. Also a take home exam.
5,No Comments
5,No Comments
5,so easy. just do the work. even if u mess up on tests  she will drop the bad answers. great prof.
1.5,"Beyond incompetent and basically phoned-in every class. Really could care less about the culture of design or the world we were getting into. Belongs more in an ""avant-garde art exploration"" class then one devoted to design and its history. Is openly antagonistic  rude and disinterested in his students."
1,I hate him. He's an ****. So damn picky and mean to his class. He also thinks he is so much better than his students. Don't be scared to challenge this guy. He deserves it.
5,I loved having him as a teacher. Mark is really into craftsmanship and work that has time and care put into it. If you don't care about the quality of your work then he will mark accodingly. Respect him and you will be respected.
1.5,No Comments
1,He's a flippin moron
5,he's ok
4.5,No Comments
1,he is teaching himself not teaching student    he is talking to himself only   it's hardly to listen what is talking about.
1,No Comments
1,The class  Design Culture  only has 2 teachers available to teach it. The other teacher is fine. The other is Mark who is rude  arrogant  brags and very defensive and aggressive in response to a question/problem. He hates computers also.
1,VERY LAX IN EXPLAINING WHAT SHE EXPECTED. NO WRITTEN SYLLABUS. SHOWED FAVORITISM. NO TEXT.
4.5,Great teacher. Loves her students. If you respect her  she'll go to the end of the earth for you. She makes sure that the assignments given are portfolio quality - deffinatly not a waste of your time. She is a fair grader if you do your work and attend class - even invited our class to her house at end of the semester!! Great Teacher  Great Person!
3.5,She's alright  a little intimidating  and she plays favorites  but over all she's not bad. She's very into multi-media  and if you're not then you better learn to love it. I dont think I ever had one plain drawing  everything had to have paint  pastels  washes  whatever. She likes what she likes. Attendance is crucial.
5,I loved her class!! One of the best teachers I've had! Take her Water color/Water based Media class!
2,I did not like this class at all. The point value given to most assignments is not enough for the amount of work that you have to put in. The instructions are not all listed  but you receive a lower grade because she did not give all of the information. Gives chances to re-do assignments for a better grade  but doesnt give enough points.
5,Great! Loved her. Would take her again!
2,Ok on reg assignments. Her tests are the problem. Seems she wants students to fail. Her exam reviews do not pertain to the test material. She takes the simplest thing and complicates it to the point of confusion. She constantly mispronounces words. All attendance taken within the first 30 seconds of class. Don't be late  will deduct points.
3.5,Lots of assignments. Very thourough when reviewing for test.
1,Taking this class right now and regret it. Was an A student and I am struggling in this class. Reviews for test but nothing you review is on the test. Makes simple things confusing all questions are up to your interpretation and even some questions not in the book. You can know the material and still miss the questions.
2.5,Not clear about what she wants. She will give an assignment to complete. The assignment is worth approx. 2 test grades  make sure you are clear on her assignment. If you have A's and have a good knowledge of the chapters and do bad on her assignment  you will get a low C.
4.5,She is an excellent teacher. I took her 6 week class in the summer. I had to work hard but I was never bored in her 3 hour classes. She teaches with power point  video  overhead  discussion and presentations all in the same class. If you want to learn and do not mind working for the grade  take her. You will retain the knowlege years from now.
2.5,The class was easy but horribly boring. She has a background in counseling so she knows what shes talking about but she doesnt know how to teach it. she has stupid activities and an obsession with dumb discovery channel movies. she cant pronounce chromosome  and doesnt know what the hell shes talking about when it comes to genetics.Dont take her!
4,You can tell by the way the person above spelled extremely.. They just may not be that smart her class was fine. You just need to go
1,EXTREAMLY boring.... she DOES NOT make clear what she wants you to do and then when you do it you get a bad grade.
2.5,Not very interesting. Pretty easy but class drags on forever. Doesn't seem like a very empathetic person.
4,boring. weird. but kinda easy.
4.5,I am his students in China. He is very very cool!! Strongly recommend him!
4.5,very nice  reccomended fo sho
1,He is a jerk. He picks favorites  i worked my tail off doing papers. I did everything he said and he gave me a c on everything i did  even when i asked him to please tell me what i need to change during peer editing. i would recommend not wasting you time and pick another teacher.
4,He is really cool. The only way you could fail this class is if you tried to on purpose. I would definatly recommend him.
4.5,he is a really cool professor! I am taking him again. The class is very laid back but it seems like you are not even finished writing one paper and he is assigning the next. Its not bad at all though. I would recomend him.
5,i love stan so much you have no idea. he's the best  especially compared to a witch like prof. cruise. never take her. never.
5,I like this professor. Yes  he will give your papers back and allow you to review it for a better grade. He is very flexible  and the class is very laidback. You have homework once in awhile  but it's never strenuous  and you learn. I recommend him.
5,revise..you'll get a better grade...no matter what
1,The ABSOLUTE worst teacher/prof I've ever had. I can't understand things he says  constantly goes off topic  VERY unorganized. I got an A in macro the semester before and I'm struggling in this class. Avoid this guy at all costs  don't listen to what everyone else says. I could tell you his favorite kind of beer  but nothing about econ.
1,HORRIBLE TEACHER!! STAY AWAY!. i never had econ before but  i studied so long for every test and never passed. Even people that had econ before were barly passing At withdrawl timehe told me to stay in because he will bump everyone up and i still recieved a D Cant understand one word he said. HE doesnt use a book but you need to buy it to understan
2,Very hard to understand. Makes the information more confusing.
3,This was a really easy class. I took it presession and studied for about 20 mins for each test and got A's on all the tests.. if you go to class and pay attention it's super easy. sohng isn't a bad teacher.
1,Sohng is the worst Professor on campus. He may be funny at times but if he would cut out the bs and just teach this class would only take 20 minutes because thats about how much he teaches everyday. Stay away from him for sure unless you are some econ genius. This guy quit teaching a long time ago... but yet still has a job.. weird
2.5,"econ is a boring class as it is...but why are most of the professors foreign and impossible to understand? he talked about ""butter"" and ""guns"" during one of the first classes and i had NO idea what he was saying..i quit going... just study the grapsh in the book/vocab and u'll get a c"
2.5,very hard to understand  outlines exam before test day  his lectures were horrible so i followed along in the book and kept notes that way which helped
2.5,I hated this class - it was so boring and I had a hard time making myself go. But  I hate econ in general. Some of his stories were funny though - not that that helped my grade any.
3,Dr. Soong cracked me up! He kept the class interesting. It was a very hard class for me and to make matters worse  I took it in Pre-Summer Session (very fast-paced) which made it harder but I passed! I think Soong is hilarious!
1,guaranteed to be the worst professor i have ever had in 8 semesters of college. not only is he ignorant to the beliefs of many of his students while making fun of those beliefs. on top of all of this he will admit to being wrong on a test question and still will not give you the points for it. any questions please contact jim in the computer lab
3.5,I loved this class  unlike the rest of these people. If you go to class  pay attention and do the handouts  you will do fine. I hate Stats and managed to get an A in his class and I believe it had nothing to do with me being a girl  he didn't even know my name  how could he just give me a good grade?
1,not very good he can hardly speak english or understand anything
2.5,Hated this class...HE is nice and knows a lot but I could never understand him at all....But I hate Econ
1,the guy was an a hole not only was he my prof he was my advisr the guy would sidtrak al the time in class n flirt wit grls in the clas he was corny didnt xplain nuting as an advisr evn wors my fresman yr. i went to him not nowin nutin n insted of helpin me pik clases n telin me bout them he jus circled clases n tol me to take them w/o xplainin them
1.5,He frequently degrades christianity. I don't think that he is a bad person  I think he is struggling. Not a bad teacher. Economics is hard.
3,i loved his examples and the way he would crack himself up. this class was hard  but no b/c he is a bad teacher  but b/c the material is difficult
4.5,*Soong Sohng. Not Steve. He's AWESOME! He's so funny in his own way...lol. He's always smiling and willing to help. I love how personal he is with the students. He's so incredibly smart and loves to talk in and out of class. My favorite teacher in Clarion!
4.5,Just becuz he is a foreign teacher doesnt mean hes stupid.. hes very smart in his way. he is just little struggling sometimes becuz of his little accent  not becuz hes stupid... duh!!!
3.5,His name is Soong Sohng... Not Steve... He's a funny guy that'd rather be stupid and drink beer than be a smart professor... but he's got a good way of teaching  and examples are of Guns n Butter *wierd nazi speech reference???*
1,:(:(:(:(
1,This guy is the worst. He makes all the students rewrite. Nova made a bad choice. No wonder why hes at a different college every year.
5,He made it interesting.
5,Very kind man and helpful.
5,he's the best and the nicest and really helpful
4.5,Super great professor. Makes expectations clear  is very willing and wanting to help students. Explains concepts in understandable and constructive ways  can't get much better.
2.5,"Dr Eierman is just  okay. Sometimes he expects you to know everything and when you ask help from him he'll be "" You should know this"" . yeah if i knew everything i wouldn't come to you and ask for help. His test are pretty okay if you study well from his study guides."
2,Dr. E is a super nice guy  but I don't think he should be teaching lower level chem. He just assumes that we already know what he's talking about  so he doesn't explain anything. Tests are all short answer  which is actually beneficial because you can somewhat BS.
2,Chem 103 was a little tough. His notes are sporadic and random. He goes out of the book so don't depend on your notes. He isn't very clear about most things but he does love what he does! The tests ask a lot of random minor things you barely cover so know everything. He has a major grading curve so that is nice but the tests are pretty tricky.
3.5,I didn't like this class  so the he wasn't my favorite teacher. but i heard he was ok for other classes
3.5,Eierman is a nice guy. He loves what he does and that's obvious. However  this class is HARD and his tests are the most difficult I have ever seen. This course is definitely geared more towards chem majors than any other. He's very helpful when you ask so don't be afraid. Otherwise  you're pretty much on your own. Good luck.
3.5,Eierman is a nice guy. He is willing to help and answer questions all the time. Hard to follow most lectues in class so reading on your own is essential to get an A or B. Overall good teacher if you are willing to put effort in.
2,He seems like he's too smart to teach an entry level chemistry class. Although I like that he gives goals and objectives sheets before tests  he doesn't do a very good job with explanation. He goes off on tangents quite often. He does demonstrations in class that are pretty cool. He tries to joke around but seems a little bit uptight.
1.5,this is the first time eierman has taught 103 in awhile. he was extremely unhelpful and came off very cold to students. i had to learn almost every aspect of the material in this class on my own. good luck.

4.5,Eierman is a great guy. He is extremely helpful at almost anytime of day. Exams and labs are kind of difficult  but he'll always answer questions. Good professor.

4.5,I really enjoyed this class. It was VERY difficult  but Eierman makes it very interesting and as easy as he can. His demos are usually pretty cool  and he makes it very clear what you will be tested on. Overall  he's a very helpful prof!
3.5,VERY hard prof. i didn't want to take both chem 103 & 104  so i decided to get it all done with just 115. chem is NOT my subject. i had TWO tutors for this ONE class! i ended up with a C & i was SO happy! eierman is a VERY cool guy and he's awesome in lecture & lab. he'll do some sweet demos in class. study  study  STUDY! he's funny  too. great guy
4.5,This guy is pretty good. I wasn't a huge fan of the material  but who does like quant?
5,He is the best proffessor I had my 1st semester. He is very helpful and approachable if you are willing to ask him ?s
4,Teaches classes well. Go to class and lab and you should be ok!
4,Eierman makes it very easy to do well. Lets you use a 3x5 notecard on every exam. Gives goals and objectives sheets for every exam  that tell exactly what will be on the test. Hands out practice exams before the test  and sometimes questions come exactly off the practice tests.If you have questions  just ask  he's very helpful.
4,I really liked Dr. E. I had him for two classes and found him to be helpful if you take the time to ask questions. Seems intimidating until you meet with him. He does give difficult tests though.
1.5,He Rules in labs. Lectures are terrible. The Goals and Objectives are good  but he dosen't stick to them. I dont even know what to study for his tests. Because he will be heavy in one area  and not so in all the other area's i wasted my time on. Whatever. I will end up with a B this sememster.
3.5,I liked this class a lot  she makes you work for the grade with out a doubt but i like that she changes form class to xclass on whether there is alecture  class disscusion  or group activity.
5,Experience counts and this lady has it.
3,Nice lady  really flaky  read a lot from the book
5,Yes  he is very cute gentleman. He cares his students even when he no longer teach them.
3.5,Most of are class failed all the tests
5,He is such a cute guy. A very nice and friendly teacher who really wants his students to do well and succeed. He also is a teacher that wants to actually get to know his students. Very approachable and pleasant. I was lucky to have him for two classes

5,John is so cute. He doesn't have a greater-than-thou attitude like most teachers. He has great life experience and is a true English gentleman. He is very helpful and puts his heart into his teaching.

5,Very good professor! His lecture is REALLY interesting  and he cares about his students. Have any question? just ask him. Be sure to attend class and read his notes  almost all of the test question come from his notes. If your answer is really good  he will give you extra mark.
3,Professor is very nice and care students but the contents are absurd (Complicated Universe is trying to be shown within one semester) and test questions are enormous within limited time All in all  you will not even expect where does the questions come from d(^_^o)
4,The reports were a little annoying and time consuming to do. However  most of the assignments were very reasonable. The midterm was right from the notes and pretty straight forward and so was the exam. The prof is nice and articulate. Go for it.
5,I took the radio astronomy course with Professor Bartel and I have to say he is one of the best profs I've ever had! The course is very math heavy but if you do the assignments  ask questions in class  and listen to his lectures  you will be okay. He makes the material so interesting! You'll definitely learn something. Absolutely recommend Bartel!
5,He really made class interesting and marked really fairly
5,He is an awesome prof! I loveee his class. Very interesting stuff and he makes them so easy to understand! Thanks prof. Bartel!
4.5,The best professor I have had at York. He is so passionate about his work and extremely engaging. One of the only classes that I found time flew by during lectures. I would highly recommend rearranging your schedule to take his class. If you go to class  and read his notes  you will do well. He often reuses his quiz questions on the midterm & final
5,One of the best profs I have had at yorku. He made it a goal to connect with every student and help them. He is just so knowledgeable and enthusiastic  he makes you want to learn more. The material was quite difficult and at times he went through it quickly  but he made you study it through his pop quizzes. Yorku is very lucky to have him.
5,One of my favourite profs! He is such a great teacher and really makes this subject interesting. He seems to show a lot of passion for astronomy. He is quite helpful as well and it's very important that you attend his classes (10% was participation marks when I was in class). Overall  great prof.
1,terribleeeeee
5,As long as you keep up with the assignments and the labs you will do great. He's also very generous with marks and insists on learning everyone's names. Overall a great prof and a great course
5,he is a great prof
4.5,He's an awesome prof  as long as you go to class do the work you'll get an A. Most of all in class he even gives hints as to what questions will be on exams. Oh and you can e-mail him asking him questions and he'll help you  or take it up for the whole class. He's really good  i enjoyed his class.
5,I love Professor Bartel. I thought he was such an interesting prof. He had a tendency to focus a bit on astrophysics which is something that I've seen a lot of people did not enjoy  but I personally loved it. He is a very nice guy  funny at random times. Very approachable.
5,Patient and always provided extra information for those who were more interested in the science aspect. It was a great course.
1.5,i dont understand him nor do i understand his accent... did not enjoy the winter and missed hall like crazy...
4.5,honestly he is one of the most helpfull profs u can get at york. I have spoken to him twice after class about prbs with the course and he halped me out and was very clear about it
3.5,Take it!!
4,A genuine nice guy  he didn't even get mad when some idiot was shining a laser in his eyes. Hahah that was gold. A 1st year breadth required course is hard to teach and his knowhow is so above it that he comes off as boring  but props to him  I give him a thumbs up.
2.5,Never slept better in my life!
4,Very nice. Helpful. Class is fun & easy to understand. Tests are HORRIBLE. No amt of studying helped b/c wording was crazy!! IN CLINICALS--BEST instructor on campus. Helpful  nonintimidating  learned soooo much! Paperwork is crazy hard for her though. Very specific!!
5,Great instructor. Very helpful if you ask for the help.
2,RUDE! Not helpful at all.
4,Very nice lady!! Definitely knows what she is teaching! As long as you study you will be fine in her class!
5,Very good teacher.
2.5,Dr. Terry is a great professor when it comes to knowing what he is talking about. He is brilliant when it comes to finance. But be warned his classes are tough no matter which class you take that he teaches. If you are confused about something don't be afraid to ask. He expects a lot out of you and for you to remember things from other classes.
4.5,"Dr. Terry is thorough and thought provoking. You cover a good deal of ground in corporate finance in ""adv fin mgmt"". While the earlier courses are a little too easy  this course is really excellent. This course makes heavy use of case studies  an excellent immersive tool. Best time to ask him questions is during or after class."
3.5,Advanced FInancial Management. His class is hard. He is very very smart and curves things  he also doesn't let you sneak out if you dont know something  he will dig it out and then teach you. Take notes and study often  this is not a class you take lightly. You will learn a lot and he lets you do things on your own and doesnt' hold your hand.
1,Dr Terry is a horrible professor and doesn't like to make sure you understand.
1,He is hard to understand.
3.5,I had him for Corporate Finance in the MBA program. It's a hard class but I felt my hard work was well evaluated and rewarded by Dr. Terry. Tests were very fair. I learned a lot.
2.5,No Comments
4,Terry's a good teacher - he just teaches courses that are hard to begin with. I've taken him for Corporate Finance and will take him again for Ebtrepreneurial Ventures.
1,Dr. Terry is a horrible professor. He will tell you in a million words what could take 5 seconds on a board. His first test was 9 chapters long. He does not weed out the important information. He relies on powerpoint for instruction and is lazy.
1.5,Explains everything in a speedy manner. Doesn't like to make sure you understand  just makes sure that you have heard what he said.
4,read the guidelines at the end of each chapter  and do the self tests online. go to class and pay attention. BRING YOUR CLICKER!! Dr. Z is really nice and encourages you to pay attention and participate!
2.5,You must attend class otherwise you will not pass the class. Pay attention in class because some questions on the test come straight from class. Her tests are quite hard and she doesn't really tell you what is going to be on the tests. Other than the tests  the class isn't very hard  its mostly being in class and you get the points.
1,She lectures. You take notes. What's in the notes is hardly ever on the test. If you don't want to have to read every single chapter  don't sign up for her class.
4.5,I was really interested in this class  but I love psychology. Dr. Z knows tons and tons about child development  and she always answered my questions. She's strict and likes things to be done a certain way  but I learned tons through this course. It's hard material  and you HAVE TO READ THE BOOK inorder to pass the class.
3,The class information was overall easy  but it is an entry level psych course
1,fOR THE LOVE OF GOD AND THE LITTLE CHILDREN! Avoid this professor like the plague! I went to talk to her about what to study after I failed one of her tests  and she didn't know I had failed her test. In a years worth of classes  I got eight A's and one C. From her class. Something's wrong here.
2,all around horrible experience. she's bland  boring  rude and disinterested in her students. she does not care about anything outside of her class. an 89.9 is a B  she doesnt accept late work for any reason  10 points out of hundreds is max extra credit. she's grouchy  mean and not a good teacher! and she finds the most obscure info for tests!
3,The tests are ridiculous! All questions are out of the book and over stuff that she didn't cover in class. It's good to go to class  though  because the in class points add up and can help make up for points lost on tests.
1,No Comments
2.5,Dr. Zlokovich (I refuse to call her Dr. Z) is unhelpful  disinterested in the lives of her students  and on the verge of spiteful. Her tests have questions not covered in lectures. The answers are buried somewhere in the 200 pages of text each test covers. Don't take her class. If you're already stuck with her  just go to class and read the book.
1,"No extra credit. She is pretty cold hearted when it comes to making up work. No true class involvement  although we had a couple of quick ""partner"" projects. Most of the work is busy work that doesn't support the material. Her lectures were dry and uninteresting. If you get a class that uses a remote control for answers  I recommend you drop it."
1.5,She was a terrible teacher. If you call her Mrs. instead of Dr. she chews you out. She would post our questions online only 2 hours before class. She was not willing to help anyone with anything. I would avoid her if at all possible.
4,I thought she was a great teacher  she really knows her material and uses a lot of examples to make it easier to understand. The class does require work on the students part  and going to class because of participation points (and a few short quizs) at the beginning of class. Make sure you do the main points and listen to lecture and youll be fin
3,"Dr. Z is a smart woman and her class is interesting  but there is a ton of reading to prepare for the tests and quizzes. Quizzes are like every class meeting. She will get pissed if you don't refer to her as ""Dr. Z"" or ""Dr. Zlokovich."" I wouldn't recommend her."
3.5,Dr. Z is a very sophisticated professor. Her lectures are pretty good and interesting but her tests have nothing to do with her notes so you have to read the book very well! Also a lot of points are based on attendence!
3,Wasn't the worst teacher I ever had. I got an A in the class because I was very interested in it. She is kind of distant but can be nice if she knows you are trying.
5,She not as bad as everyone says. She is strict  but the class isn't that hard. You have to read the book  but the lectures aren't bad. You do have to show up for class bc she gives quizzes and participation pts. Her tests aren't too bad  she just uses sophisticated wording. So as long as you can decode the wording  the test is really not bad.
2.5,She is hard and stubborn... I would choose any other professor other than her
5,Don't let all these bad comments scare you off. I took adolescent psychology in the summer with Dr. Zlokovich. I needed the course as an elective for my doctorate and she was nice enough to add me to the class and adapt the assignments to meet my needs. I studied hard  but easily got an A in the class and learned a lot.
2,Seriously  I want to warn everyone to choose ANY other professor for this class. There are so many other choices:overby  delgado  sebby. I've heard that all of them are better. If you ARE foolish enough to sign up with zloko****  then you will suffer thru a semester of hell...
5,Now known as Patricia Farrish  Amazing professor. Laid back  understanding  makes class fun  light work load. and you actually learn. Reviews are exactly what is on the test  nothing will blind side you. Attendance is not mandatory  but I enjoy being there. This goes for ANY class she teaches. I've taken her any chance I get.
3,Going into this class I thought it was a blow off class that I just needed for my major. The first day she tells you that she is notorious for giving too many A's. HA! It isn't that hard of a class but you have to go and have to actually study. She told me I would get an A and that wasn't the case when I got my Final Grades. Bitter.
5,Great teacher. Very relaxed. Everything on the tests comes from the notes and she usually tells you what will actually be on the test!
5,This class is definite
2.5,Class is soooooo boring  i can't keep my eyes open more then 5 minutes in there. Goes over powerpoints every class. Class only consists of 3 test (which are hard to pass and are long) a paper  and a family shield. The test are nothing like the reviews that she gives. I wouldnt take this class.
5,She is so funny and makes class a lot of fun  even if it is not something that interests you. She makes class enjoyable and adds in a lot of jokes and fun talks if you participate. her tests and projects are super easy. book is never used because she hates the book. read and take good notes (which she gives you) and youll do great!
4,This class was awesome! She is a really cool teacher and is fun and easy to get along with. You are definately entertained in this class everyday. I totally recommend taking this class with her! You will be happy you did  plus we got out early almost everyday!
5,I have had multiple classes with Yancy. She is so funny easy going and always a pleasure to have. Granted her classes are pretty darn boring even she gets bored but she's good about letting the class go early if no one is staying awake. So sweet and a fun class to be in easy grade take her!
5,Great  nice teacher. She makes class fun and interesting while teaching.
2,It is borring as hell  every class I want to kill myself  for the test she make the review sheet in class but the test can be completelly different than the review sheet.
5,She's great! Class is very relaxed. She understands things come up and is very willing to make it possible for everyone to acheive their desired grade. She's funny  can come off as a little arrogant  but tells great stories. cancels class a lot and lets us out early. Teaches what the class wants to talk about.
5,I love Mrs. Yancey. She is so funny! Class notes come in handy for the tests  but other than that her class is a lot of discussions. She is from Mississippi and makes fun of herself and her family a lot  which is refreshing. Take her if you can!
5,She is extremely easy not much work and only two tests all semester including the final.
3.5,This class was very easy but BORING! we only had about 4 grades and they were all simple. Really don't need to go to class. She gets most of her information offline and just lectures from that. If you want an easy A take her  if u want an interesting class  DON'T
5,I love love love this teacher. She is very laid back yet she knows her material. She doesn't try 2 sugar coat it she states the facts. There are 2 test they're multiple choice and she your notes are your study guide. This class is very easy if you come and do your notes and simply participate
5,She is so much fun!!! She's hilarious. She is very good and picking up the mood of the classroom and if she isn't feeling well or if she could tell the class was just in one of those  'I want to go home' moods she would totally let class out. She gives study guides for tests and goes over them in class.
5,She is my favorite teacher at semo! Down to earth and witty and very practical... Her tests are easy and her lectures are interesting!
5,Yancy is a very laid back teacher. You'll do well in this course as long as you atleast try.
5,WONDERFUL! very practical....she gives it to you like it is....
5,"Awesome AWESOME TEACHER. Ms. Trish Yancey  of the Human Enviroment Studies department. She is an wonderful teacher who has gone above and beyond for her studies. She is down to earth and supports her students no matter what. She likes to say ""bad"" words in class. No Regrets in ths lady! Fav Teach!"
4,This class was not as difficult as everyone is saying. YOU MUST READ THE ASSIGNED CHAPTERS or you will not pass. His test are difficult  but the other assignments were basically free points. The forums are opinionated  and the research paper isn't too bad. He seems annoyed if you email him.
3,Class content overall not hard. Forum posts are easy and are based off your opinion. The test? 4 chapters. 50 questions with 40 minutes you do the math. YOU HAVE TO KNOW IT. If not you are doomed. But it's so much information it really is hard to know what he will test you on.
2,such a boring teacher  literally reads off the notes he gives to the class for the whole class in the corner of the room. Hope he gets canned
4,I took this class online. It consisted of weekly forums  a few tests  and one paper. I liked that the forum questions were easy to discuss and based on your own personal opinions/experiences. The tests were timed  so it was necessary to study in advance in order to not run out of time. The class was really easy for me.
2,Forum Assignments are easy  test are timed and difficult. Don't expect any help from this professor.
3,I don't fee like he actually knew much about the subject. (Drugs and Behavior) he read directly from the powerpoint. He never was able to properly answer questions from students when they came up in class.
3,This class was really hard to stay awake in  but it was an easy A. All you have to do is read the book!!! Go to class because you get participation EVERYDAY!! Won't give you an excused absence unless you are at a UNIVERSITY EVENT!!!! If you like to sleep during class this is one that you can!!!
5,I absolutely loved this course. The textbook was great to read (most days a page turner) and Dr. Kinney taught directly from it. The tests were of no big surprise and I learned a lot. It was great having the opportunity to scratch out five questions we did not want graded on all of our tests...boosts the grade. I would absolutely recommend taking i
2.5,This class is not that hard. The only hard part is trying to stay awake listening to Kinney lecture. He is very boring but the material is not that dificult. He reads directly off the slides and you can print off the notes. I used the interactive website that goes alog with the book to study for all of the tests. The final is not comprehensive.
3,He's not a bad teacher  just slightly boring. It's possible to make an A in his class if you study hard for his tests  complete the forum assignments and submit the 5 page paper at the end of the semester.
2.5,Online course  READ textbook  and you will be fine. Grades hard on papers  forum assignments are easy  but you must complete them.
4.5,I would recommend this teacher. The forum assigments do not take up much time and the 2 papers that are due are not very difficult either. All in all the tests are the hardest because it is timed and isn't just definitions. You have to understand the concepts. He curves the grades too!
1.5,I took online class PY 101 There is basically no work except 4 on sundays when you have to complete a forum. However  the tests were hard & u have 2 read the chapters at least 3 times to pass  at least that is what he told me when I emailed him about my grade. You have 2 papers that are like 6 pages long. I don't suggest this class.
3,The class was pretty boring  but the material covered is pretty stimulating. Dr. Kinney teaches directly off the slides  but he is very knowledgeable. Not a hard class at all if you read the study guides and go to class. Not much class interaction at all.
3,My super ego is drawn to say he is a decent teacher for moral reasons  but my Id says he is the most boring teacher imaginable. Every class he reads directly from the powerpoints and tells stuff related to material he thinks is funny but isnt. To pass his class you must always go to class  and complete online work  If you dont get As on his tests.
4,The class material is very interesting and he is extremely knowledgeable. Although his teaching style is a little boring  you learn a LOT!
2,Extremely boring teacher. All that he does is stand in front of the room and read the powerpoints. His test are pretty hard  but if you study you should at least get a c on them. Go to class and do the online forum  and they will boast your grade. You should at least get a c in the class if not a B.
2,very boring teacher  and really doesn't care about his students. If you go to class and get your perticipation points and do the online assisgnments your get a B or C in the class. The test are pretty hard and confussing though.
5,I really enjoyed this class.
5,Loved loved loved this class. It is alot of hard work  but so very interesting. Lots of thinking involved. I remember some in the class would leave completely exhausted from thinking too much  wanting to bang their head on the wall. You either love it  or you hate it. But you can't deny that he is an awesome teacher. In my top 3 of favorite teachers at Southeast!
4.5,Professor Dowd was one of the best professors I ever had. The exams are 60 question- half lecture/ half textbook and cover 4 chapters each. The final is not comprehensive  so that helps. Definitely take for Miami Plan!
5,He is awesome
3.5,i was in his first honors section  and he def. kept us busy with reading and papers. overall  a great guy but use his office hours if you get stuck!!
4,Great teacher. Makes the lectures interesting. The exams are half lecture/half textbook. All the exams cover 4 chapters each. The final is the same as the other exams  not cumulative. Great class and amazing professor!
4,Tests are half from lecture  half from the book- so its necessary to read. Just going to lecture and not reading will not do you much good. Overall great teacher  easy to talk to out of class.
5,Best Professor  Ever! Even had our class over to his house for dinner!
5,Great teacher! This was one of the most interesting and fun classes I have taken at MU. He made the already interesting subject of Psychology come alive and stick to your insides. A great man that will always be a part of his students.
5,Best educator I have ever experienced.
5,He definitely makes psychology fun  and interesting! Five years later I still remember a lot of what he taught me
5,one of the best lectures i've taken
5,Everyone always said how great he was  I wish I would have showed up more to class - I missed out on having had an awesome professor!
5,dowd was an amazing professor and is dearly missed by faculty and students. he's a legend. he was fun to listen to and knew his stuff. his tests aren't easy  but i enjoyed going to every class.
5,One of the best educators I have ever seen  with an outstanding passion for his students and the material he teaches. I still remember lessons he taught in my freshman intro psych class  and that was in fall of 1999!
5,Dr. Dowd is one of the most memorable professors I've had at Miami. He cares for the students and enjoys what he does.
5,He is the best teacher I have ever had...I know he is dearly missed!
5,I had him 6 years ago and I still remember him being the most excellent professor I have had. To be able to sustain the attention of a 300+ students in an Intro to Psych class is amazing. He is the reason I chose Psychology as my major.
5,The best teacher i've ever had and will ever have
5,great teacher
5,Had a bigger heart than any professor I've ever had. He'll be sadly missed.
5,No Comments
5,Prof. Columpar is a great lecturer. Very engaging  and able to explain important concepts clearly. Eclectic choice of screening material: there'll be something for everyone! Tests  exams  and assignments aren't easy  but they are fair. If you're willing to do the readings  attend lectures  and put the work in you should do well.
4,Not easy grades but definitely fair. If you study and do the weekly readings you will easily get an 80+ (unless you aren't good at writing papers). Prof has excellent lectures. Easily the best lecturer I had in my first year. Sums up the readings really  gives great examples  and is very clear with concepts she is trying to explain.
4,Great prof  very inspiring. Some found her lectures too boring  but I really liked that she scripted it beforehand - it cut down on rambling. Lectures were very useful  more often than not there was new and interesting material. Readings were interesting  syllabus was constructed well  and assignments were light.
4.5,She is an amazing professor! Her lectures are clear  concise  and entertaining. You can tell she is genuinely excited about what she's teaching. She is also very smart. The readings are important in this class  as are the lectures which you don't want to miss.
4.5,she is the best professor I've ever seen. her lectures are so organised and clear excluding using too many ornate vocabs.
3,She's overall a good teacher  but it's really distracting and irritating when she uses a lot of obscure words  especially since I've heard her use those words incorrectly or mispronounced them.
4.5,She is fantastic  speaks clearly and gets all the concepts across in a stimulating environment. I was unfortunate to only have her for the first semester as she went on mat leave as the other prof wasn't nearly as good. If you have her you will not regret it :)
4.5,So knowledgeable and so kind  an amazing lecturer. However  a lot of what her lectures cover in CIN105 (Intro to Cinema Studies) is exactly what is covered in the readings.
4,Great teacher and also a total babe
5,Corinn Columpar was the best cinema studies professor I had at the University of Toronto. She is very confident in her understanding of film theory and she elucidates her thoughts eloquently and efficiently. She made me see film in an entirely new way and I'm grateful for the perspective she gave me. Take her classes.
1.5,The lectures and tutorials are a joke! They consist of re-gurgitated summary of the text book chapters  reading and quotes and she goes off into tangents about her interests in art  history  music. A bit of a money grab scheme to intentionally force students to pay extra for academic readings when she could easily chose readings off of JSTOR.
4.5,Beautiful  passionate  eloquent  amazing.
2.5,Stunningly beautiful
4.5,Great lecturer  clearly enthusiastic about film and her passion rubs off on students. Very clear  very helpful  all in all awesome prof!
5,Incredibly eloquent lectures. Spells out content in various ways with great examples. Very fair in expectations  marking and rules in class. Very attentive to questions from students. Interesting and approachable. Uses very relevant information
2,she does her lecture by reading off her notes with redundant vocabulary. two assignments are not only time consuming but also being graded hard as hell. x08T.As pretend to be nice and mark very mean.
2,While doing lectures the material got lost in her unnecessary vocabulary that just made her sound pretentious. The course doesn't tie in historical context or significance of our time which can make it seem like an overall useless topic. I love movies  but this course really turned me off to any future endeavours in cinema studies.
3.5,Interesting lectures that provide an essential framework for deeper cinema study. Also  great taste in music.
4,Her somewhat boring  complex lectures are absolutely necessary if you ever hope to get a grip on the material. The course is harder than most. WORK HARD ON THE FIRST ESSAY.
3.5,Great professor as knowledge goes  but she is uptight and takes the fun out of the course. This course is harder than political science  just so you know.
5,No Comments
3.5,A lot of problems came from all of the sections having to do the same thing...I don't think that it was his fault...
1.5,He has favorites in his class and he is not afraid to show them. He does spend more time on their questions.
3,Good labs  lousy lectures.
4.5,No Comments
5,He was probably one of the best teachers I've had so far
5,Best teacher I ever had.
5,Great teacher. Very clear and straightforward. He is very organized and answers question very nicely. The tests are stuff that are covered in class/discussion/homework. So just go to all the class sessions  discussions  and do the homework and you'll be fine. Speaking of which  the homework is not too difficult  like it was in EECS 12 (with Lin).
5,Amazing class  has an in depth understanding of the subjects  and is a pioneer in the field of ray tracing and realistic image synthesis. Thew classes flow very smooth  very comprehensible. Possibly the one of the best course i've taken.
4.5,Take him if you get the chance. Prof Arvo is enthusiastic about teaching and is by far one of the best professors in all of UCI.
2.5,This course is time consuming and difficult  but that's the nature of the course content. After you're done all the projects you feel a sense of real accomplishment. Arvo delivers the subj. in sizeable chunks that are easy to digest. He understands the inadequacy of some student's background and accomodates. Best professor period
4.5,The rest of the comments are spot on. One of the best professors UCI has to offer. Gently explains complex topics  provides beautiful proofs  and encourages good note-taking by providing clear explanations on the whiteboard. Always well prepared and very helpful during office hours. Take this course if you get a chance  you won't regret it.
4.5,inspired  kind  expert
3,One of the best Profs here. Outstanding teacher!
5,Exceptional  best class (Grad Graphics) I've ever taken.
4,Automatic extensions for homework assignments and open note midterm/final. Lectures are pretty clear and is always willing to help. Tries his best to get the class involved during the lecture.
5,Great class  very clear lectures. Focused on helping us understand the concepts in depth. Homework policy is very fair (and TA was helpful). Every other professor at UCI that taught about P/NP-completeness left me confused and scared (Eppstein  I'm looking at you) but Arvo made it clear and intuitive.
5,I only took this class to get rid of a requirement but Professor Arvo made the class interesting. He's also a really nice guy who printed out notes for everybody who came to class. The notes are so good you probably don't have to go to class  but his lectures make life eaasier on you.
5,ics 139w was one of the few classes i really enjoyed going to. very pragmatic in what he taught  but in a good way. i highly recommend him for this course.
5,Truly inspiring. Never preaches. Shows you the door and leaves the rest for you to explore. If I could go back to school again  I will definitely love to learn more from him!!
5,one word: awesome
4.5,Really easy class  the hw is worth 50% of your grade. Midterm was easy but the final was harder. Read and ask TA if you have questions but if your TA sucks then good luck in the 2nd half of the hw.
3.5,Lectures were very boring and didn't really apply to homework. Grading was 50% hw  25% midterm and final. Pretty hard class if you've never programmed before  but he's really helpful and the TAs try. Probably one of the best programming teachers however  becasue he wants you to do well in his cla
4,The class was kind of iffy.. and what we were supposed to learn was kind of unclear.. then again.. it is kind of a weird filler cse class i guess.. but arvo tried his best.. tried to teach us as much as he could and was always willing to give us extensions or clarifications on hw problems.. good guy
5,"Awesome guy. Lectures aren't really boring  and he does have extensive knowledge about the subjects he teaches. Likes naming sample functions/methods ""foo"" or ""bar"" heh. I recommend him."
1,Cares for his graduate level classes but sure as hell couldnt care less about his undergrads. Its sad.
1,No Comments
2.5,If this is all you need for math requirements  take it when u have and easy quarter. Definitely do-able  but not the most interesting proffesor. Go by what he lectures and his homeworks to succeed.
1,Dreadful!
5,Has a deep sense of the material  and the wonderful ability to explain through examples. Very helpful.
2,She was not very helpful. She was a hard marker  but could not explain concepts well. Relied too much on the textbook.
3,Prof. Wagman is a very nice lady but sometimes you don't know what to expect. As long as you study the textbook content and attend class regularly  you'll be fine. She won't specify which areas to study but that's fair as everything covered in class is test material. The best part is that she will get you speaking Spanish.
2.5,Answer all of the questions in the textbook and you'll rarely be stumped for an answer during class. If you don't understand a concept  consult the text book. If you make a grammatical error  you'll be penalized heavily for it. Not interesting  very  very dry. Remember your vowels.
4,To be fair Pr. Wagman did teach the class a lot and I understood her lessons mostly  however there are several good reasons not to take her class. If you make a mistake she'll take a fit and make you feel awful. I was a beginner and didn't know any Spanish last year  am just glad to be done with her.
1,This professor is HORRIBLE. I spoke minimal spanish prior to this class.This professor has ruined the language for me. She doesn't explain things well and she expects you to be fluent.. she gets MAD when you don't understand something!!! She's friendly  but not a good teacher for an intro class. Expects you to be fluent by the first week!
1.5,Avoid this teacher. Juan Carlos Garcia is 100 times better!!
1,Horrific teacher. Venezuelan's can't speak spanish. The most horrifying teaching methods. Every class all she does is read every single word of the text book. you cannot learn a language like that. She has no vivid energy in her class. Everyday is boring as hell. The worst language class I ever had.
1.5,I actually loved Spanish prior to taking her class back in 2006. I actually had one of my majors in Spanish. After her course  I dropped it faster than you can say arriba. Not kidding. I dreaded going to her class once a week for THREE hours. It was torture. She is not vey exciting  we did everything by the textbook...just not fun at all.
1,Unless your a native spanish speaker  avoid her. She seems unsure of her own language. She's confusing too- you never know what's for homework or on an exam. And  she likes essays VERY VERY clearly outlined  thesis  support etc. Otherwise she can't understand it. She doesn't directly answer quesiotns either.
4,No Comments
4,seriously... do your homework!and ask her what will be on the tests...she's very specific about that. Overall GO TO CLASS and just be prepared because she does tend to pick on people. Ask lots of detailed questions at the end of the course because there's a lot to learn at the end.***She's very helpful  and went out of her way for me many times***
2.5,She's a nice prof. Really. Very understanding and kind as a person  BUT she marks so freaking hard. *groans* And she expects you to show up for EVERY class and puts you on the spot. Make sure you do your homework and read the textbook because the course is heavily textbook based. If you don't do your homework  she will hate you and pick on you. D:
4.5,good
1,boring  boring  boring. avoid her at all costs she is a horrible prof. not clear on what her expectations are  boring boring boring...that is all
2.5,If you knew Spanish before taking intro to Spanish  you'd be fine. If you didn't  then hard luck. Either way it was more useful to tune her out while she taught and teach yourself from the textbook. Substitute her with anyone who knows Spanish grammar  and you wouldn't be any worse off. Just the same  I got a great mark in her class
3,She's a bit of a tough cookie. In 2nd level she expects you to know the stuff from the intro course. That's fair. She just needs to be more explicit in her essay and test requirements. People can't get 60's for no apparent reason. Don't get me wrong  if you know your grammar  i mean KNOW it  study it  you'll be ok. I already knew it  so I passed.
1,She assumes you already know everything  therefore her teaching skills SUCK
3,Let's just put it this way: a disappointment in my attempt to perfect my Spanish.
3,She is a nice lady  her sense of humour takes some getting used to. If she senses you are doing your work and trying hard she will encourage you  if not look out! One thing that really bothered me in this class is the fact that it's an intro. to spanish class  yet we have 5-7 people who speak spanish in the class! Shame on you!
4,She's a nice lady. But she needs to understand that we have more than just the one course! We can't always keep up and read ahead before we go to her class. But she thinks that you dont do work at all just becuase you cant answer her questions in class. I'm still an A student in Spanish  but I have lost my interest in this language.
5,Claude is very thoughtful and intellectual with her teachings. You can and will learn so much from her. You can count on her if you have any problems of any sort  she will be there for you with a genuine heart. Thank you for teaching us!
5,Wonderful teacher. She truly wishes you to succeed. Very approachable and lenient towards your need. Enjoyed her classes very much and all of her assignments were useful!
5,An awesome teacher overall.Enjoyed going to her classes and very knowledgeable in the childhood field.
5,Very nice teacher and have alot of experience in a child care field......very patient and loving
5,she's an awesome teacher  and is really good especially when she's reading children's books to us  she makes great sound effects too  as she reads them. the text is quite difficult to understand however  so make sure u keep on top of it. out of all the classes the text is an in-depth analysis about acquiring language  it tends to be hardtoretain.
4,Nice woman. She has a lot of experience around kids so she makes the class interesting.
5,Amazing  understanding  helpful  approachable  kind and a great resource for students.
4,Very supportive teacher.
5,Favorite instructor in the ECE department. She's professional  but alao so caring and helpful. She genuinely cares about her students. She gives so much amazing that is so helpful if you really go over it. Always has time for students if they want to talk about a grade. Brings in personal experiences to compliment a lecture/lesson. Great teacher!!!
5,Love! Favorite teacher ever. She is the sweetest. Organized classes and notes. Cares for her students. Easy to approach and talk with. Her tests are easy if you take good notes during class!
3,nice teacher if she likes you
1.5,Information and content straight from text. Overheads rehashed version of text. Not funny at all  very strict and has follow her philosophy/style or its wrong.
5,Very freindly and funny. Her notes and clear and organized which makes it easy to study for her exams
4,Very nice and a supportive teacher.
3.5,shesaniceteacher.sheiscertainlyveryknowledgebleabout thehistoryofearlychildhoodandcareshepracticallyhas all her material memorized  at times she speaks a little fast and sometimes i found her language to be incoherent just because she tends to use a lot of sophisticated vocabulary both when shelectures  andalso onherxams.studyhardforherexams 
1,not fair at all!!! i would never take her class again
1,Terrible teacher  horribly unapproachable  condescending and unsupportive.
5,GREAT TEACHER! Very funny too~
4.5,Great teacher! Everything he tests on is in his lectures that he has for you on his website. Extremely helpful and has the best interest in the students. If you make the effort he will go the extra mile for you! Some of the information is a bit dry but if you put in the time you will learn so much! Seriously awesome teacher. Tough class though :)
3.5,His lectures are so long and the lecture notes that he reads off of are filled with too much information that we shouldn't even need to know. He doesn't clearly specify what to know on exams and his exams have too many true and false questions which throw us all off. He's a professor with a lot of knowledge but he should change some things.
5,Rose is a very good teacher. He is clear  helpful  friendly and gives you everything you need to get an A. He types out all the lecture material for you and as long as you know everything on that  you will get an A. But  he is tough  expect to spend several days studying for each exam  and lectures are long
5,Mr. Rose brings the world of the unseen to life in his Microbiology class. His attention to detail in lecture and lab is impeccable. By the end of the course I feel that I knew a lot about infectious disease  working with bacterial cultures in lab  and safety. Mr. Rose is a kind and caring professor  while maintaining rigor and professionalism.
2,If you have ever thought about dropping out of school this class will make you want to follow through with it.
2.5,LOVES TO HEAR HIMSELF TALK. Lectures are very long and boring. He goes over every lab and film you watch thoroughly before you do the lab or watch the film which completely takes all the fun and curiosity out of it. Very redundant. He will repeat things over and over again like you are a kindergartner and can't comprehend. Not my favorite class
2.5,Lectures are LONG! If you're a visual learner you'll have a hard time trying to learn all the information he gives you. All the lectures are on his website in pdf format and that's exactly what he uses during his lectures  rarely writes on the board. Tests are very tricky truefalse and matching. If you don't love micro  think about taking him.
5,Rose is amazing & HELPFUL! He really made me regain interest & drive in my intended profession as a RN. One of those teachers you will remember/recommend always. Class was tough but he makes the information fun. He loves to ramble off about random facts/stories but he is entertaining and opens your eyes to a whole new world in the healthcare field.
4.5,He is great! Record lectures will help and everything you need to know are in the lecture notes. Material can be very though  but if you pay attention and study hard  you can earn an A! It's possible. I did it  and you can too! He is an awesome teacher and very entertaining at times. I enjoyed and learned a lot from his class!
4,Dr.rose is awesome lectures really need to be recorded goes fast also give lecture notes but need to study every day and attendance is a must!!i studied alot  only earned a B.
4,Buy a digital recorder!!! YOU WILL NEED IT!!!! Take good notes  re-listen to lecture  re-write your notes  trade notes with someone else and you'll do great! Prof. Rose is straight up  honest and helpful! He's more chill if you get into the PM lab! Easy to talk to. Seems harder than he is! Do the work and you'll get a good grade! You have to earn i
1,Careful about making mistakes in his class  might yell at you. My classmate was yelled at in front of us when she made stupid mistake. Just warn you  to whoever might take his class.
3,TOO MUCH INFORMATION! Overwhelms students with the amount of information and do not give out any lecture notes! Lectures have some organization but for the most part are all over the place! He is very intrested in the subject and gets excited when he lectures which causes him to talk FAST while he's lecturing.
5,Teacher that cares about his students. He's very organized - he's almost obsessed about it  but it's a good thing because his lectures are organized  but u may have to record his lectures because he gives so much info n leaves no time for daydreaming. If u blank out for 1 minute u are lost in space!
5,Rose is sweet and an awsome teacher. He cares about the success of his students. I was nervous about this class since i took it in the summer. My doubts were unnecessary. though the class was hard i learned alot and managed a B. I would recomend him in a heartbeat
2.5,This teacher is easy but I didn't learn very much
4.5,Anatomy & Physiology is a hard and exhasting class for most of us  but Prof. Rose is the best at explaining processes in a way that we all can understand. Thanx
1.5,no comment
4,A very nice and a lenient teacher .Understands the students problems
5,she was such a fun instructor. we did a lot of hands on activities which helped us with our practicums. she's relatively leanient about assignments  ie. she'll extend dates if u have a valid enough reason. she almost always has a smile on her face  which makes the classes so much more interactive/entertaining. her exams are pretty easy(midterms
2.5,her speaking not clear at all.one inclass essa(750ws) two essay(same)+final+ part marks her teachin is quit boring her class discussions help alot. Also  take notes of wat she said about shot lighting dramatic stit( asked in the final)foucs more on idea than gramma

5,Best prof for Econ. Knows his stuff well and interesting lectures
1,HEHEHE
1,His lectures were not helpful and the final exam was ridiculously hard! Other profs provided slides with detailed information to their students while bruce hammond only put a few graphs on his slides. My friend is currently retaking Econ1021 and you know what  most of the people from that class were from bruce hammond's class last semester.
1,Why were most of the recent bad reviews deleted? Bruce is probs reporting all these lol
1,Unreasonably hard exam  fun fact  rivers macro econ filled up right after Hammond's final exam.
1,Lets just say his lectures are a perfect example of diminishing marginal utility and my grade perfectly resembled an economies of scale graph.
4,I had Hammond for Micro in fall term 2016 and Macro in winter term 2017. I thought he was a good prof and was able to get good marks in both classes. However  after a year  it looks like that has all changed as I was reading all the comments for the fall 2017 micro term. Just goes to show how classes/profs can differ year to year. Just be careful
1,What can I say except for the fact that his disgrace of a professor told his students that he's going to intentionally make the average between 65-68. Most unreasonable prof who expects you to teach 3/4 of the material yourself seriously go f yourself Bruce
1,hehe
5,Really enjoyable prof! Loved attending lectures and exams were really easy
1,Ive been doing the same lmao
1,Funny thing that everyone is complaining about him this year. I definitely agree based on my experience in first year
1,I regret coming to Western because of this man. Not only is he an awful teacher but he is a terrible person. We pay all this money to get an education  we put endless ours of studying in and no matter how hard you try  you will not do well because he purposely wants his students to fail. Because of him  I now have a negative outlook on western.
1,never have I met such a cold hearted man... merry Christmas to you too bruce.
1,For the final exam I read the entire textbook  did all suggested problems  went over the first two exams completely  and all in all probably spent 30 hours studying. All of that was for nothing as the final exam was insane and unfair  and it seems like Bruce doesn't want anyone in his course to do well. Would recommend switching out of his class.
1,The only concept I learned in his class was the idea of diminishing return. Well he sure did a great job of helping us understand it in real life by making the class average exponentially lower each time we write the test.
1,Would never take again
1,Litterly studied so hard  and the final didn't make any logical sense. Most of the questions were concepts that have never even been relayed in lectures or the textbook. it was almost as if I wrote a completely different course exam that I KNEW nothing about. guessed every question. cried during it
1,terrible prof
1,Worst prof ever  he doesnt care about his students lives. I sometime question his true intentions
4,Two things: heavy reading and group projects. Though all of this in preparation for upcoming tests. Again  the course mainly consists of heavy reading  group projects  tests  and observation projects at the NVC Child Development center. Smyle is very lively and is understanding. She is willing to help if you are confused with any of the readings.
1,If you want a teacher that doesn't teach I'd recommend her  she gets paid way too much money to not teach us. She isn't good at explaining her content well and expects her students to keep up with her nonsense. I love learning and I've had plenty teachers and she is not one I would ever take again. If this allowed a 0 that's what I would put.
4,I have never read so much in my life. SO much reading and quizzes every class. I took her one day a week class and it was so hard for me to keep a good grade. She's a great professor and is passionate about the subject. Our class was really fun but she is a hard grader. Would not recommend taking her one day a week class unless you have to take it
5,I love her! My boyfriend is in the Navy  and when i asked for a week off she told me
5,Fantastic teacher! Supportive and great at getting her point across. Thought provoking and very passionate about her field. It's contageous  and what she teaches changes your views on children forever. Teachers don't get better than this!
5,Faye is a wonderful professor! She is inspirational and VERY FAIR in her grading and treatment of students. If you work hard she will reward you!
5,Very clear in objectives and expectations. Willing to help you help yourself. One too many group projects  though. If you're a fan of lectures  don't bother.
5,No Comments
4.5,She is an amazing teacher.....She brings alot of experience to her field and tells us how she dealt with alot of children....She is always smiling......
5,I REALLY ENJOY HER CLASS FROM AN OVERALL STANDPOINT...SHE IS REAL CLEAR AND SHE GIVES A LOT OF EXAMPLES WHICH MAKES IT EASIER TO UNDERSTAND THINGS.
5,Faye is a brilliant educator in her field  she has the experience and wisdom to teach about child and family studies. While the content of her course isnt hard  the workload is demanding.
5,Faye is brilliant  I love her views. As a mother I learned a lot from her.
4,Before the tests  I just studied the text book and I never got less than a 90% on any of them. Because he gives you a FREE text book on the first day of class  you do not need to take notes. All the material he covers is right in the book. This spring semester of 2018 is his last semester ever  so NPVC will lose one of their greatest professors.
5,Mr. Charlesworth is the BEST. He is hilarious and knows so much about space. If you've been daydreaming about the unknown  take his class! It's an easy A if you show up and do the work! You have to study for the final or you may not pass. He is available outside of class to help you if you're struggling as well.
4.5,Excellent teacher. I have taken both his ASTR110 and ASTR111 and have enjoyed them both. He keeps his lectures interesting and well-paced throwing in the occasional corny joke. Just attend the lectures and make sure to study thoroughly before every test and the class is an easy A. So hurry up and take this class before he retires!
4.5,Great teacher- funny  down to earth  made the class very enjoyable and relatable. He wrote the book himself which made it very useful!
5,Excellent teacher! Keeps my attention the entire class. He's in his 80s and has been teaching at the college for 50 years. He is a national treasure! Don't miss taking a class from him.
4.5,Very interesting and enjoyable class and teacher. He does everything he can to be helpful  but you have to attend and study every week! Highly recommended for serious students.
5,If you fail this class you have no one to blame but yourself. There is a TON of memorization (it's astronomy what did you expect?)  but everything that is on the test is in the textbook and mentioned in class. His stories and corny jokes make it easier to stay awake since it's a night class  too.
2.5,We had to study A LOT in this class. Don't take the class if you're looking for an easy A because you WILL fail. His tests are mostly T/F which I find harder than multiple choice questions. His teaching style is quite hard to follow  but you can tell he really has a passion for the subject. Our text is extremely helpful  so use it!
2.5,I really wanted to like his class. BUT I like Charlesworth better as a person than as a teacher.He just rambles on and on.He makes sense in class but if you read his book at home it gets confusing.I hate this class and it's not hard at all  he's very easy going and wants to be helpful.I just cannot pay attention to anymore of his boring repetition.
4,Charlesworth is hilarious! He LOVES astronomy and is very clear in his lectures. He wrote his own textbook and all the material you need is in it. Aside from two star quizzes  the rest of the material is pretty dense  it is NOT an easy class  a lot of studying is necessary  but Charlesworth makes the class entertaining.
3.5,He wrote his own textbook  and lectures out of it the whole night. Your grade will depend on 3 100 point tests and 2 star quizzes (which depend on memorizing). Not an easy A  unless you love astronomy and are a science person.
5,He was recommended to me by my friends. They were right. A very interesting class and teacher. Many interesting and funny stories. A nice guy  but you have to study. One of the best.
1.5,I really hate his teaching style... he goes on and on and doesn't explain things well. Plus he wrote his own textbook... and you must read it because he's not great at teaching... retire already..
4,I dont know why people are giving such a high rating  I absolutely couldn't stand his teaching. I get he's trying to make it fun.. but w/e. You have to stick to reading the book. it's a must and so is attendance. Quizzes are easy if you read and extra credit is easy by showing up for star gazing.
5,So goofy. So ancient. I wish he were my grandpa. I would know everything about the stars if he were. His class is awesome. He is awesome. Just hope you don't get the 'you're in college now' speech. I love his class and fully intend to take his other one next semester. He's the only teacher who demands a south facing classroom. He's great.
5,A very kind  thoughtful  helpful man with a passion for teaching  students  and astronomy. You will enjoy every minute of his classes.
4.5,I've taken two classes from him. His is my all-time favorite: enthusiastic  helpful  funny  fair  knowledgeable  etc... Take him soon before he retires completely!
5,Absolutely the best! Extremely knowledgeable helpful enthusiastic FUNNY!We're so lucky to have him at Napa J.C.The classes are interesting  and its knowledge you'll keep and use for life!
4,I loved Charelsworth. He is really funny and his topics are intresting  they are easy to follow if you pay attention. He had a few fun feild trips where we got to go and look at the sky and you could get extra credit just by watching a space video! I loved the class. Plus the book is really cheap because he made it  I think it was $15.00
5,Pretty easy class if you either understand it or do some studying. Very helpful teacher and he makes science interesting.
5,Seriously  if you actually kept up with the class and did the reading assignments it was a very interestingand enjoyable class. If you're not a slacker consider it a GPA booster.
2.5,as crazy as it seems  she actually helped me out with the final. all her crazy rambling on about all this weird stuff was exactly what i needed to know for the final. I just took the final and believe I did Extremely well!
1,This class was horible! I hated the professor and the content of the course. She is Crazy!! Whatever you do don't take Soc 101 with her. I hear there are way better professor that teach the course. I best thing was how we made fun of her shoes that she wore each day!! that was fun!
1,She is so crazy. She will ask a question at the beginning of class then go down the roster until she finds the answer shes lookin for. Avoid the crazy stare and beware!
2,She is a terrible teacher. She is boring and unintresting. I had her as a night class  it was awful. Try and avoid taking her...
1,you never know what this prof is up to she is nuts I hated her and her class I fought sleep till I could not take it any more and dropped the class beware of the CrAzY LaDy!!!!
3,She is very nice and funny. Her class is not hard as long as you do the reading  which is mostly interesting. At first I did not want to take this class but soon learned that sociolgy can be fascinating.
1,One of the worst teachers I've ever had. We had a different syllabus each week. She makes no sense at all. Her mood for the day determined what kind of grade you got on assignments. Definately would not recommend.
1,wow this teacher is nuts.. i really dont ever pay any attention to what she is saying but I have a B in the class so i guess that makes her easy...
3,Paula Moore is clueless to the world. But she did give us a bunch of days off so she would get good feedback from the class.
5,No Comments
2.5,She calls herself a feminist  but that's just her justification for despising men. Had her for Sociology of Linguistics and she doesn't know a single thing about linguistics. The worst thing is that when she doesn't know something  she just makes it up. The studies she had us read were bogus  too.
1,This woman can not only NOT teach effectivly  she can not clearly communicate or abstractly think. Her grading is unfair and her lectures disorganized. Sje decided DAYS before midterm to get a book  and then changed which book we needed twice.

1,the class has made me miserable. it has been my worst experience at eku. she needs to do something about her mood swings and i am sick of watching her drool over her picks.

1,This lady is a fruitcake  she gave us 4 different syllabi and you never know what she wants  very unclear and her grading is completley unfair.
1,No Comments
1,I did not enjoy her really bizarre book choices at all. A ton of work to do for her class and way too much reading to do outside of class. Also  if you're shy  be weary because she really wants a lot of class participation
5,Tenger is my favorite. She is very accessible outside of class and genuinely wants you to succeed not just in her class  but in life. She is a pretty easy grader if you do what she wants (she gives tons of handouts with exactly what she wants you to improve on). She's actually a really nice person  though she may seem intimidating at first.
4,A lot of reading involved in this class. Essays are kind of long toward the end of the semester  but she is willing to help! Would take again.
4,I had Dr. Tenger for English 102  which focused on mental illness with three short texts and four papers  none over 2000 words. I found her class to be rather easy  but she liked my writing style. She is known for grading harshly  but as long as you write basic  organized essays that explain the topic well  she will be generous with grading.
1.5,She is a nice lady but her class requires a lot of work which is graded harshly. I received a zero on an in class assignment that I had an excused absence for (email from health center was sent to her) but she wouldnt let me make it up and it hurt my grade by a letter grade.
1,Horrible experience. I have never had a teacher who hated my work as much as Dr. Tenger did. I tried my hardest to understand what she wanted in her papers  but never could. Prime example: I went and talked to her  did EVERYTHING like she told me to  and still got a C. Wasn't worth my time.
4,yes!
5,She's so nice! Such a fascinating class. Easy tests if you study and put forth an effort. I'm an English major  I don't like lit a whole lot  but she made it all very interesting. She's finds the strangest things funny  it's great. Take her for any class!
5,I enjoyed Dr. Tenger's personality. I hate talking in class so I didn't like that aspect of her classes but that is my own problem! Lit Crit was my favorite class with her - I think I really enjoyed the structure.
2.5,She is very nice as a person  and grades papers fairly  but I didn't particularly like her choice of books for us to read. Also just as a note  most of her classes seem discussion-centered  and if she suspects that the class isn't reading  she'll start giving pop quizzes.
4.5,She's really fun to listen to and a good gader very lienient
5,Dr. Tenger is the greatest. I just love her classes! She is really well organized and very calm.
1,While Dr. Tenger has a great personality  her class lacks structure and clarity. Discussion topics are not relevant to papers or tests. While she is lenient  she is also very unorganized.
5,I love Dr. Tenger. She is so funny in class. I don't enjoy literary criticism  but she makes it as interesting as possible. She's also a very lenient grader  and this is one of the easier English courses in the major.
4,Dr. Tenger does a good job guiding class discussion and she finds strange things funny  which makes class interesting. Who knew there was so much in The Secret Sharer.
4.5,Dr. Tenger is a great professor who is always available for help.
1,"Ok  he hardly shows up for class. All he does it babble on about politics and hardly mentions anything that we're actually supposed to be talking about. One day he just let everyone out about himself (awkward). I think he enjoyed the 70's WAY too much. Easiest ""A"" anyone will ever get."
3,Dibble is a little weird and starts going off on tangents  a lot! but when it comes to getting an easy A or B you can't beat Dibble just put your political views off to the side in his class.

2.5,Classes are not challenging. He doesn't engage the students
5,Hes opinionated and a bit biased  but hes got a good sense of humor and is fun to talk to  if he can hear you. He wont bust any chops for stupidity  so avoid him during the summer semester. Good man though and will listen. Its a relaxing class (nice if you're taking 12 units).

3,dibble is a joke.
2.5,Dibble is the funniest guy i know..lol. Its a easy A class  and he makes it interesting. Sometimes he is hard to understand  but really all you have to do is show up to get an A in his class.. He pisses off many people which makes class funnier..lol

3,Very easy class and Prof. Dibble is a nice guy. This specific course needed to be a little more structured  he was as lost as we were.
5,One of the best professors I have ever had  the best I have had at PLU so far. Great learning experience always engaging class sessions with fun content and awesome guest speakers. Really helped me do well in class obviously he cares for his students  even wrote a recommendation for me. Would highly recommend taking any of his courses.
5,I took this course last year and it changed my life  because he sort of became my mentor  and I'm just one of many mentees. It's easy to do well in his courses  but seriously if you show him effort it will be the best decision you ever make. Fun  funny  chill  helpful  and super well connected.
5,One of the best profs at PLU. I graduated 6 years ago and looking back he is still my favorite.
5,BEST PROF EVER! HE IS AWESOME AND HE WILL ALWAYS HELP YOU! HIS QUIZZES ARE EASY JUST WATCH THE NEWS! LOOKS LIKE HE GETS HIS NEWS FROM CNN MSNBC AND SOME LOCAL STUFF! HE WILL ALWAYS MAKE CLASS FUN!
5,Great teacher with interesting discussions  no lecture. good j-term class
5,Great prof.! J-term Media in the World. He made a 3 hr class fun and interesting. Enjoyed going to class. Heavy use of textbook but gave us questions that would be on final day before final. On top of that he's a really nice and cool guy.
5,best prof ever.
4,Media in the world. took it over J-term. quite a bit of reading (if you chose to read) and had an assignment. relative to other j term classes  very easy. awesome prof!!
4.5,best professor at this school
5,Rob really cares about his students and their success. He is interesting and knows what he is talking about.
4.5,Awesome  baby!
5,One of the all time best.
5,This was a great professor. He was fun  and always kept the class going. I learned a lot from him.
5,Incredible.
5,Simply amazing.
5,He is such an amazing prof  I schedualed my classes for next semester around him so i could take another class from him
5,Rob is a wonderful prof. I was somewhat intimidated going into his class  but ended up LOVING it. I have probably learned more in his class so far than any other comm course i've taken. He is extremely knowledgeable and approachable. Lots of busy work  but well worth it!
5,BRILLIANT!
5,Rob is probably the best professor ever. He is very laid back and his classes are so enjoyable. I've loved every single class I have taken with him.
5,No Comments
5,Makes it easy to understand the systems behind the grammar. Could do more work with vocabulary  but that's something you can get at home. Has a wonderful German accent that makes her kinda hot.
3,good teacher i enjoyed her class and i even met my exboyfriend in that class.
2,A real Hottie! She may only be here for a few semesters. Languages are hard  she makes it harder.
3,She does care about her students I can give her that. The only problem is she goes way too fast with lectures and it's a difficult time trying to understand the problems when she immediately moves on to the next. How are we supposed to learn from that? Every other week she gives a quiz and I think we should go over the problems more before.
5,Amazing professor! FIN 301 is a difficult class but she explains everything so well  you barely need to go over it in the textbook. She is very accessible outside of class and will see you at any time you need! Tests are difficult but she scales them and she gives you extra credit. She takes pride when you do well in her class!
5,Professor Luther is by far one of the best professors I've had during my tenure. She will teach you the skills to not only do well in school  but also excel in the industry. She will meet with students on her off hours and weekends  and has a great sense of pride in her students' accomplishments. Highly recommend her for this and any other courses
1,"Finance is a hard topic generally speaking  but she made a lot more difficult than it needed to be. In class she would teach us basics like ""what is 1 + 1"" and the tests and homework would be more like ""find the circumference of the sun and how long it would take us to get there"". DO NOT TAKE. If you can get any other Professor do it."
3,Was definitely a hard class  but you will learn a lot. She teaches at a fast pace and takes attendance every class. Assigns a lot of homework but doesn't check it until the end of the semester for extra credit. You will need the textbook. she assigns homework from it and quizzes us on chapter reading for participation points
5,BEST PROFESSOR EVER! she genuinely cares about giving you an education instead of just helping you simply pass the class. She is funny when necessary and is all around such a great human being. If you respect her and listen to her lectures and do your work you will pass. Definitely will take this class again 100x over
4,She is tough  wants you to participate to help you understand Finance. She really cares about you learning and getting something out of class. Last semester she started using online resources which made some of the homework easier.
5,Professor Luther is one of the best Business professors Salem State University  if not the best. She personalizes her teaching to suit each class and individually each student. The information I received from Professor Luther is unmatched by any professor. She helped me get the information I needed to get an internship and is not my advisor.
2,She is one of those professors that expects you to fully understand a concept after one explanation of it. The way she explains things is very vague and confusing. She needs to find a different approach because the way she does thing's now just isn't cutting it. Please do yourself a favor and try and find a different professor.
5,Professor Luther is a fantastic teacher. She makes the class fun  engaging  and easy to understand. The workload is manageable and the material is extremely relevant to the real world. Would definitely recommend her class if you want a solid understanding of the material.
3,If you want to be treated as child this professor is the one for you. Participation is mandatory and you will be call by name and ask to go to the board and solve problems in front of the entire class (it reminded me of elementary school) Do yourself a favor and take a class with a different professor.
1,If you are finance student or actually interested in knowing finance  i suggest you don't take Luther. although she acts as if she knows what she is talking about  she talks too fast and jumps over the whole topic. i barely understood anything in her class. Also  her grading criteria is not very clear.
5,awesome professor
4,awesome liked her ...she is nice
3.5,She is a great teacher. Class is hard. If you put the work into it  she is very fair. She drops lowest grade and scales all tests. Must be prepared for class to earn points which account for 10% of grade. Do the work and you will be fine.
5,Prof Luther is an a outstanding teacher
4,Excellent Professor. I took on a Saturday for 8 hours each session and I always left excited to continue learning thet opics we discussed. Very engaging and bright. Not an easy class  must do assigments and study.
1.5,She is very difficult to understand  and I don't think she understands the questions you ask either because she very rarely answers them correctly. If you understand the subject you will be fine. She scales ALL of the tests and drops the lowest one excluding the final VERY easy class but she is an irritating teacher.
4,She's a good and nice teacher but this class is hard. I would advise to take a small load when taking this class. I would not recommend missing class because of the important material that is being taught. The book was no help to me especially if you're stuck. The teacher is helpful so ask her as many questions. Also form a study group  its helpfu
2,This professor requires a lot of work compared to others who teach the same subject. Take a light course load if you have her for finance because it took hours to study for her test. GOOD LUCK!!!
5,"An expert in this subject. He tailored the exercises for each student  according with the native background. Do you know that the ""sh"" sound does not exist in Spanish. Do you know that the sound for ""w"" was ""v"" for some students (we sounds ve)  and I can continue on and on"
1,he is very very very poor professor. his pronounciation is really strange. his teaching skill is not easy.
1,he is really poor! ESL class is so worth than others. if you take his class  you will be regret your choose. he likes only female students. he never use textbooks. he never hear students' questions. he is veryveryvery poor~!!!!!!!!!
4.5,He tells you exactly what is going to be on the tests and what to study. Very nice and helpful. His grading scale is very generous. Easy A.
3.5,No Comments
5,Very clear and concise with the material. Also he's very nice and makes a lot of comical remarks on his handsome appearance in his past life.
5,He's a very nice profesor  makes a lot of jokes and tells a lot of stories. If you don't understand the material he explains it until you understand it. His test are very easy  do the lab hours and homework and you will past the class.
4.5,Reading and writing. forget buying the workbook  but you do need the text. Another $ saving tip  dont bother with the CD either. Overall a b+ teacher. If you dont have a thick skin  pass him by. He is tough  but fair and you cant fail  if you work.
4.5,I had professor Inch for several classes in the late 90's. I enjoyed his sense of humor and learned a lot from him. Ed was also my advisor and believed in me at a time when I was young and struggling.
1,"Overbearingly rude and thinks it's cute. He is very harsh and views himself as merely ""demanding."" The actual material and class is pathetically easy  but he tests over inane details and is rude to any students with questions. Even intelligent and well thought-out questions usually result in him announcing to the class that you have wasted his time"
4,Ed is a good man  but he can put people off. Sometimes he says or does things  sometimes he uses a tone  sometimes he makes people feel stupid when they don't necessarily deserve it. If you're quick and don't mind sarcasm (or if you can fire one back 'cause he can take it) then you will get along with Ed. If not  then perhaps reconsider.
3,Tended to pick favorites  but easy to talk to when you're feeling lost in the program. Easy to get along with...eventually...
4.5,"Ichy was a great prof. I still remember day one of COMA123. A solid educator and a good guy. Heh. ""housekeeping."" That word just popped back into my head. (Maybe we can raise $20 million and send him up to the space station so he can see that the earth is round.)"
1,Confusing  arrogant  rude.
4,He treats his upper division students the way they should be treated. Tough but flexible  and he KNOWS what is useful and what isn't--which is great. Hard to find him one on one since he's busy.
5,always willing to work with students. funny  if you're smart. confusing  if you're not.
5,No Comments
1,Said all deadlines were FLEXIBLE and then wouldn't let us turn in a late homework assignment. Makes it difficult to succeed in his class.
5,I took Kathy's photography class in 2000/2001. She was excellent at motivating individuals with photographic art. I wasn't the best photographer but I did enjoy the projects and they surprisingly came out well. I always admired my classmates and their creativity with her projects. She was excellent - Thanks Kathy
5,She was very caring and enjoyable to be around. You'll be doing class time partially online each week through the series of videos she provides. Some are pretty silly  you'll for sure crack a smile. Each project is challenging in its own way but be wary of going too big with your ideas  it's all very time sensitive.
4,Throughout the class I was able to learn about different photography techniques I had no idea about. Important to mention  Haddad is a very hilarious instructor and easy to connect with.
5,Kathy Haddad is one of the best professors at Chaffey College. She is so sweet and truly cares for her students. This class is not hard  just do your weekly readings in the textbook (usually about 20 pages) and take the quizzes every week. Two short research papers- very easy and some discussion forums  which were very minimal. 10/10 recommend!!
4,Kathy is a very laid-back type of professor. Attendance is usually not mandatory as long as you do put in the work. She does have very unorthodox approaches to assignments and projects and the medium in which she bestows it on her students. However  there is method to her madness  and I do feel like I retain info from her classes.
5,One of my favorite professors! I have had her for Photo 7 and 9  and am waiting to take 50. She is passionate about her craft  talented and loves teaching. She doesn't take herself too seriously and is great fun! Her classes are work with lots of info  but she uses a variety of media to teach it. Quizzes can be tricky.
4.5,Kathy is so much fun. But if you want to do well you much keep up and do your assignments on time. There is a lot of Internet videos to watch  many with her in them. They are a crack up  but you do learn a lot from them. Lots of work  but it is always fun. She is a great teacher.
5,Amazing teacher she made me love to class and not a lot of teachers do that. She makes education fun when it's really not and she teaches you the best way and all of the criteria unlike other lazy professors. I recommend Kathy but at the same time a lot of people are getting to know she's the best so my advice is pray you'd get in her class
5,Kathy! I love her so much! I took photo 7 and 9 with her and she is such a fun enthusiasts teacher! if you take her hybrid class be prepared for lots of videos and lab work outside of class. she's really heavily focused on pushing you to your next and best level. I wouldn't have taken any other teacher 4 photo. she was the best ever!
4,Kathy is an amzing professor. She cares about her students but participation is a must. Following directions is key to this class and it is an easy A if you do what is required. She gives feedback and if you follow it you will succeed. I would take her class again in a minute.
3.5,Kathy is awesome. She's funny in a dorky way. She makes sure you get it. I learned so much from this class. If you are interested in photography  I highly recommend her!
5,she's awesome! if you want to learn how to take awesome pictures take her! she loves to help and is helpful the best professor Chaffey has! I would take her class again totally if you have the chance to take her and learn photography definitely recommended
4,If you want to take a photo class  Kathy is the one to take it with!! She was so much fun. I learned so so much from her class. She makes everything easy to understand. And she is very creative.
5,Kathy is AWESOME! She has a way of inspiring creativity and getting your mind working. Her instructional videos are hilarious and informative.
5,Love Kathy!! She is so fun to have as a professor. Also pays attention to each of her students which is great
5,Kathy was so much fun! I learned so so much on her class. She is helpful  clear  and bubbly! She makes everything so easy to understand. If you're going to take a photo class  take Kathy's classes! Looking forward to taking her Photo 9 class in the spring.
5,Kathy is truly the best professor at Chaffey hands down! You WILL learn in her class. I have become a better photographer because of her. She makes you interested in the subject because she explains it crystal clear. I am looking forward to taking more of her classes in January 2013!
5,She is the greatest and funniest teacher at Chaffey. Her videos are hilarious!The projects are easy as long as you put some effort into them. Make sure you silence your cell phone or else you will be bringing in a bag of cookies for the class next time.
5,Digital photo 7. Great professor! She explains everything crystal clear for you. Exams are easy if you do your work. Show up  do your work  and you will get a good grade.
4,Professor Haddad is a very good teacher. She really gives her joy of photography to her students! She doesn't always explain her assignments well but she is VERY helpful when you email her or ask questions.
5,Best lecturer I have ever had  very interesting and you don't have to show up everyday if you don't want to. Would recommend showing up .
5,I took Social Problems as well as Criminology and I thoroughly enjoyed both classes. David is a very straightforward  get-straight-to-the-point professor  so class definitely got depressing sometimes. He does not sugarcoat anything  which I believe helps us learn concepts better. Overall  I would highly recommend taking his classes.
4,Hyde is a really cool guy and always has interesting stories to share. He is super smart and intellectual to the point where it's kind of intimidating. Some of the time when people raised their hands he would kind of shut down their ideas but for the most part he is really nice. Super easy homework. He takes attendance once a week.
5,One my favorite professors so far. Very lecture heavy but his lectures are always interesting  and he throws in some personal stories as well. Only assigns one assignment a week but it's quick and easy and the final is open book!
5,He's probably the best professor I've had. He really cares about his students and really prides in his lectures. In addition  his lectures are all available online just for anyone to use. The assignments he gave were easy  all you really need to do is attend his classes and you're all set. Plus his stories are great. His final was easy. Take it!
4,Great professor and has interesting lectures. Although he lacks group projects and even though his lectures are interesting  if you don't love listening to lectures they can get kinda boring. TIP: for the test  go to his lecture notes on canvas and hit Ctrl+F on your keyboard. It's an open test so you can do word search on notes to get the answers.
5,Professor Hyde is awesome. I learned so much from his criminology class. There was barely any homework and the tests were really easy if you paid attention and took notes in class. He lectured most of the time but he was not boring about it. He told a few personal stories. I would recommend for any class.
4,Lectures can get a bit boring  but he adds in really amusing stories about his life to help lighten things up. Minimal homework
5,One of the best teachers I've had (ever). He tells great stories  the whole course is basically lecture. We have one final exam. We have weekly assignments that are really easy. Loved the subject material. He knows what he's talking about. Loved his lectures. Wished it was a bit more interactive. Would take him again if I could.
4,He's a really nice teacher. He really cares about the students.
4.5,I loved this class. He teaches from a sociology perspective and you learn so much. Quirky  blunt sense of humor-- and tells the wildest stories. One assignment per week  with a final at the end of the course. Show up to class  and do the weekly assignment. The classroom dynamic is lowkey and comfortable. Super cool guy. Highly recommend him.
3,I took Hyde's Global Sociology class because my previously selected class was canceled. He even wrote the textbook for the class (plus it's free file he gives out for download) I had him for Criminology a few quarters ago too and it was very interesting. Some very crazy stories from his life  and a very friendly guy overall.
3.5,David is a good teacher. He knows how to make the subject sound interesting  no matter what it is. He also has really good stories to tell. If you have an opportunity to take a class with him  do it. You won't regret it. The only homework he assigns is reading 1-3 chapters a week and a weekly online discussion. The final was open book  open note.
4.5,LOVED HIM. He rocks  so nice. He's kind of awkward but the best type of awkward. Saw him downtown Oly so that's cool. He is opinionated but doesn't force his ideas on you. I liked him.
4.5,This guy likes to get deep. Tests are open note  sometimes open book  so it is SUPER important to take notes. If you miss a day you can always get the notes off of his power points or from a fellow student. Make sure you do ALL of the assignments ON TIME. That is where most of the grade is.
4,Hyde is by far the best professor I've had at SPSCC. His criminology class was extremely interesting and I learned a lot from him! The lectures could sometimes be dull but he would tend to tell personal stories to liven things up. The homework load was minimal and we hardly ever used the book in class. You need to take a class with Hyde!
4.5,Genius!!! Sorry  David Is a hottie .... to bad I will never have a class with him again
4.5,This is my second quarter with Hyde. His class is easy  but heavy on lectures. There are no tests and the only assignments are weekly discussion posts and a final paper. Its pretty easy  and an interesting class.
5,Hyde is probably my favorite professor at SPSCC. He's interesting  engaging  and knows what the hell he's talking about. His stories spice up his lectures and the information he shares is really interesting. I learned more in the classes I took with Hyde than in any other classes. And it was incredibly easy. If you're on the fence  do it.
5,I am obsessed with David Hyde. I am majoring in sociology and have taken every class he has at SPS. He should be teaching at the University level because he is a walking  talking genius! If you print out the PP notes at the start of class and follow along with lectures  taking notes on PP's  you can't go wrong. EVery day is interesting!
4,easy grader  very knowledgeable and easygoing. he really just cares if you are present during critiques(but mine was an advanced class). always seems happy to be there and enthusiastic about digital art.
4.5,Very nice. Sometimes maybe too nice. Not assertive at all  which can be frustrating.
5,Not only is Craig one of the most experienced and passionate professors I've taken a course from  but he is just a really  really nice guy. He is very laid back about grading  which allowed me to explore the course material much more thoroughly. Craig is one of those professors who just loves what he does and  as a result  is rather brilliant.
5,Craig loves photography and loves to teach it. He gives out weekly assignments  but they're typically easy. He's always a joy in class and teaches tips and tricks in photoshop that most people didn't know. He's been using photoshop since version 1. Take digital imaging from him  he's much more experienced than others teaching it.
5,Excellent teacher  photographer and software author.
5,brilliant + computer dork + makes good art
5,Jason is the best!!! Seriously  value every second you have with him. Hes wonderful.
5,I took Jason's EmAC class years ago. Jason maintains that perfect balance of friend and professor. He knows how to earn respect from his students as well as give respect to his students. I learned a ton from Jason and his class really broadened my horizons as an artist and did so in a very encouraging way. Jason is an absolute asset to MICA imo.
5,Had him for eMac my freshman year of art college. Great teacher  super helpful and knowledgable of what he's teaching. Class has a lot of freedom  but also just enough structure. Great lecturer as well. Highly recommend Jason!
5,Prior to this class i didn't even know what the adobe cloud was. I was nervous that because Jason taught the advanced emac class I would really struggle. But we went through each program from the ground up and our projects were left relatively open. Jason is really helpful and willing to make time out of class to help as well.
5,I knew very little about sound art before this class & this class was awesome. It's very hands on & the classes are jam packed with workshops  demos  visiting artists  performances  etc. Fun class!
5,Had Jason for Sound Art. Jason is very helpful and enthusiastic. Good teacher. But the class utterly favors electronics and Jason seems to believe that if its not Avant Garde its weaker. Its a bit like going to a music school and taking an art class to find that the prof is a virtuouso in photoshop who thinks painting is passe.
5,Jason is the best professor I've ever had!He LOVES subject he teaches.Very intelligent and fun/funny.Always prepared to explain/answer absolutely anything and if he doesn't know atm he'll find it out for you!Jason helped out a lot with choosing IxDA as my major.He cares a lot about his subject and the students!Very excited for Sound Art with him.
5,"I've had IxDA Seminar with Jason and he is a great professor and cares a lot about his students. Very techy guy & ""nerds out"" often (in a good way!) we took a lot of field trips & had many guest speakers/artists. Allowed us to see a variety of future paths in the IxDA field. he's mad into sound so take is classes"
5,So great. Jason is an amazing lecturer and makes himself available. Definitely is an inspiring teacher.
4.5,Jason has inspired me more than any other teacher I've ever had. He's a delightfully funny guy but more importantly  he LOVES what he's teaching. He's influenced me to realize that I am indeed an Interactive Media major. Thank you  Jason.
5,Jason is a great teacher always is getting you to push what you are doing at the moment.
5,Jason's a great teacher and has become an important part of the Interactive Media Department. He knows how to motivate students and get them to look inward at themselves and question why they make art. I never really thought much about concept or history before I had him. He's really helped me to focus my voice. If you haven't taken him yet  do it!
5,Awesome teacher! Knows A LOT of stuff and is into cool **it. Had him before and now I have him again. 2 Sweet!!
5,Great teacher. Very technical course for the first half  but we got to do some really cool things after we got the basics under our belt. He put a lot of information into the class but it's stuff I have not gotten from my other teachers. We did HTML  CSS  XML  Dreamweaver  Flash  action scripting  PHP  video and sound. LOTS of New Media Art too!!
5,class is kind of hard  but professor sloan is the best. i never thought i would ever get html or any kind of coding or techie software before this class. i'm learning ALOT very quickly. he knows quite a bit about everything. i'd recommend taking him if you take this class. i heard he is the best emac teacher too.
5,Great teacher and he's the best looking one at MICA.
5,Awesomeness!! Jason is amazing and very helpful.r Very nice guy  and very intelligent. He made what could have been a difficult class fun.
5,Great teacher  great class. Pretty interesting stuff. Very knowledgeable about the subject matter and I learned a lot. Good stuff here.
5,Great teacher. Dude knows a lot of stuff. Very technical course but he makes it interesting. Looking forward to later in the semester when we can be a bit more creative. He's very helpful. I was not getting a lot of the HTML stuff and he came in late on a Friday afternoon to spend an hour and a half to help and I finally got it. Not too many teache
5,awesome teacher and is fun. knows his stuff. lots of work though.
5,Professor Potter is THE best sociology instructor. He genuinely cares if you're understanding the material and is more than willing to help. Lectures were quick and informative. His one-line jokes are an added bonus. Definitely take Professor Potter if you have the chance!
5,He is the BEST professor ever!!! He is by far the best Sociology Professor. Love him. He is very flexible with his schedule. He always asks students if they need help with their essay questions.
5,Love this guy  great professor to take for sociology. The winter course is very condensed though (making studying for tests hard)  wish I had taken him during a full semester. Lectures were great (you can record too) and he is very nice about getting you a free online book so that you can use it for the course. Also  it's hump days on Wednesdays.
4,Pretty easy  doesnt post grades at all though. he doesnt believe in using much technology. no homework really except studying and the workbooks which he helps out with
4,This class was really easy! Potter is an easy teacher and there was hardly any work for the class  the only downside is you can't see your grade because he doesn't use Canvas but you can always ask for it!
4,His grading is based on attendance  1 oral presentation  1 midterm with essay  and 1 final w/essay. Essay prompts are given 1 week in advance to prepare for. The oral presentation is based on a single question off of the reading  its really easy.
4,Professor Potter is a really good and caring professor. He goes through his lectures at a good pace to make sure you get what you need. The only downside is that your graded on few things  but as long as you study hard its a great class to take.
5,Boomin' voice and great enunciation. Lectures at a good rate- not too fast & not too slow. Willing to always repeat himself to make sure you get the notes down. Very caring and approachable. Gives study guides and preps you well for the exams. Lectures are precise  but it's better to read the book too when studying for tests. BEST TEACHER EVER!
5,He's honestly the best teacher out there. I am so glad I took him. His grading is pretty easy as well. He does try to help his students out by giving a practice test before the actual test. Hes a very understanding and wonderful teacher.
4,His grading is based on attendance  1 oral presentation  1 midterm with essay  and 1 final w/essay. Essay prompts are given 1 week in advance to prepare for. The oral presentation is based on a single question off of the reading  its really easy. Go to his class  his exams are based on lectures.
5,lectures can seem a bit out of date and somewhat boring  but he cares about his students and he really tries to make it easy for everyone. Class attendance and the oral presentation are gifts from him to you. Easiest 20% of the grade. Just show up! Goes over everything that will be in exams! class paper is easy  just follow the outline. no hmwrk
5,Took him in the summer and he was ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL. His grades are based on: attendance  oral presentation  1 midterm w/ essay  and 1 final w/essay. Essay prompts are given 1 week in advance to prepare for. GO TO CLASS!! His exams are based on lectures. The book is helpful  not necessary. Loved his laugh and his personality. 3
5,He's a really good teacher. Tests are just the midterm and final
5,I learned so much in this class. Potter is a VERY CLEAR professor  and is always there for students. I can't stress how much information I retained after taking this class. I highly recommend taking this class.
4.5,Professor Potter is the best instructor I've had! He makes every class fun and really knows what he's talking about. Make sure you read the book to pass the midtermfinal (even though he gives you a study guide). Highly recommend this class! Enjoy!
4.5,Mr. Potter is a great teacher even though that he's not easy. He only does midterm and finals. He also does class paper  attendance  and chapter presentations.
5,Truly an amazing professor. Potter has inspired me to minor in Sociology just by taking his class. Attend class  take notes  and read the book. Doing all this will get you an A. He gives the essay question weeks before an exam. Super helpful  kind  and he really cares about his students. Wish this man taught every subject in the world.
5,Pay attention in class. Take notes  study the notes  and you will do fine.
5,GREAT PROFESSOR! I had Potter for winter... class was fun yet you learn. Great group class discussions. he reviews everything that will be on the tests. everything in his lectures is in on the test... EASY A!!!
5,GREAT CLASS. very nice lovable guy with a booming voice like james earl jones'.he makes the subject very fun. a midterm/final/oral presentation/paper. very helpful to his students. MUST TAKE!
2,very nice teacher good on grading  but hard to understand hand her handwriting  also hard to understand her accent  she is all over the place can be very confusing
1,She CAN'T TEACH. and she CAN'T SPEAK ENGLISH. Her tests are very difficult. I fix computers for a living and her tests are even hard for me. I think she is russian. QCC should hire translator for her. lol. She is really a math professor and can't teach computer scince. I feel sorry for her math students too.I am thinking of dropping her class.word!
1,this professor needs to learn how to speak English  lol. You will have tough time understanding her. She is also evil.She said she will send students to the dean for talking (quietly)even if it is about classwork.Makes students use blackboard.SheCAN'TTEACH!She can't teach comp science  I can feel sorry for her math students. Classisnothard  she is!
3,This class is not meant for the 21st century. I feel  like I already know more about computers than this professor does. She doe not speak English well and is mad boring. The class is a joke. One of her classes got cancelled  because noone wants to register for her class. She does not seem like a computer expert. Extremelly boring!
1,Absolutely dread this class. Wasn't the most appealing topic  but it gets really bad when the professor is terrible. She's really nice and all  but very very boring. She has no control over her class. Hopefully she's only like this with this class  but judging from the other comments made by other students  unfortunately not.
2.5,Hated her at first  I thought she won the teachers lotto and thats why she was allowed to teach  *BUT* she is a sweetheart! and will go out of her way to help you...just be patient!!
5,I'm telling you guys she's so easy and helpful a little bit confusing but just stick to the review test and then that's it
4.5,shes a very nice teacher. even though i hear alot of complaints from the class its onli becuz they are not payin attention at all but yet they expect the teacher to bend over backwards to teach when most of the class doesnt even pay attention. definitely good teacher.
4.5,Many students say this teacher is bad  but if students would just pay attention and do their work they would find that this teacher is very helpful and very nice. If you do your work in this class you will get an A.
1,SHE IS THE WORSE PROFESSOR EVER. YOU CANT UNDERSTND WHAT SHE SAYS AND SHE JUMPS FROM ON THING TO ANOTHER. SHE CONFUSES HER SELF AND HER STUDENTS
1,terrible. can't teach. Very confusing. I droppped her class
2,Holy crap! Can Q.C.C please hire a translator?!? She can't teach but is still an easy A.

5,if you are aiminfg for an easy A she is perfect for that...
4,SHE'S EASY!
5,No Comments
5,this professor was AMAZING. I enjoyed every minute and she is soo good at teaching. If anyone needs to com 113 class  TAKE HER
5,I had her in 1996. She is a kind person who cares about her students. I learned a lot in her class. I didn't do all the work necessary and so received the grade I deserved.She was very fair and even gave me chances to make it up  but I was taking 5 classes and working full time so I didn't bother. She's a really good teacher  I liked her a lot!
5,BEST Professor I've ever had! Learned so much in her class. She's not an easy grade but what she teaches will get you A's in all other classes. So much more than a Speech class. Highly Recommended.
5,I expected to give some speeches  pass the class and move on but Ms. Manatu made this class into a true learning experience. She wants you to participate and engage in the class  which by 8pm was hard to do but def* worth the effort. She lays out everything you need to do in your speeches with detailed outlines. Loved this class!
5,The Perfect Speech Professor
3.5,She is good at her job  she can sometimes rant  but she knows her work  people who thinks she nuts don't really want to be in her class. just listen and do the work you will be fine.
5,She is great! She makes YOU personally responsible. She tells you how life really is. She does not tolerate immaturity  ghetto  BS  goofing off. She worked very hard to get her PhD. She expects you to work hard in her class and in life. You may hate speech  but you will come out of her class one step closer to being a real woman or man.
5,I LOVE THIS PROFESSOR!I honestly wish i can take her again.She is amazingly insightful & knowledgeable about her work and has a passion to teach.She is no nonsense however  and you must respect her class or she will set you straight!That's what i loved about her the most.I've learned so much in and will view films differently from now on.
4.5,She's amazing. Very easy class. I was scared to take this class cuz I hate talking in front of ppl but I got A- with almost no effort and late speech. She's fair and helpful. Explains the material over and over again.
2.5,This professor was absent many times. We had to rush with everything we learned  thus it was harder to comprehend. She walks into the room without acknowleding the class  i find that really rude. Personally i really did not like her and she made me hate speech class.She would have these outburst  it made me very uncomfortable.
3.5,You will never forget her as your profeesor.
1,Two words: DRAG QUEEN! She always sits there sucking on her teeth  and sighing throughout the student?s ENTIRE speech. She is a mess in a designer dress  despite shoddy attempts at professionalism  and is always complaining about her medication! She is an attendance HOUND  but missed 5 days herself last semester. AVOID AT ALL COST!
4,she was an ok professor i felt as though she was just a little to harsh she needs to consider speaking tok some people in private about matters rthat can be dealt with in private. otherwise she wasnt bad at all i learned alot and had a few laughs. Shes a DIVA in every respect of the word.
4,You will learn a lot and see life through a different perspective. It is an interesting class but it does require an open mind and maturity. So red or green pill?
4.5,Manatu is NOT easy  but she is fair  she cares about her students  and she is GOOD. I cannot understand how anyone could find this woman boring
2,No Comments
5,THIS PROFEESOR IS VERY NICE SHE HELPED ME ALOT TO LOOK AT LIFE IN A DIFFERENT WAY  SOME PEOPLE THINK SHE IS HARSH BUT IS BETTER THAT WAY CAUSE LIFE IS NOT EASY AND IF YOU ARE HUNGRY FOR SUCCESS SHE IS A GREAT HELP TO ACHIEVE ALL YOUR GOALS. SHE MADE ME REALIZE THE BEST THING IN LIFE IS WHEN YOUR WORK FOR WHAT YOU WANT.
4.5,Learned alot in her class. When she said what you learn in speech class will help later in life (ie job-related  and just plain communicating with people) she meant it. Didnt care for public speaking before her class  now I wonder what the fuss was about. She made it simple. Great teacher  but tough. Condescending at times  but means well.
3.5,Yeah  I agree with what the previous student posted on Manatu. You do NOT want to get on her bad side. Do all 3 speeches required for the semester (Mini Intro  Informative & Persuasive speeches)  ace the Mid-Term & Final & you'll be alright. Oh yeah  do give her feedback because she expects it. She'll go nuts if no one respond back with feedback.
4.5,Great prof. Really knows what she is doing. Teaches well. If you don't do the work and mess around however  watch out. Her bad side is not cool. Gets sidetracked at times but her way of looking at life is interesting and very funny. She doesn't assign that much work so just do it when you get it. And read the txt bk.
5,One of the best classes I ever had at FIU  even though t was Saturday mornings. Very cool professor and a very cool class.
5,One of the best teachers at FIU.
5,Prof. Kneski is what study abroad should be all about. He has little patience for children  but all the time in the world for those that are serious. Best teacher I ever had at FIU.
5,Great teacher  challenging class. He is always available outside of class for help. We actually published a book in this class  what a great project! If you're lazy  this is not a good class for you.
2.5,Expect to do A LOT of work. Some of his assignments are pointless. They can also be difficult and time consuming  but he's an easy grader. The class is pretty boring.
5,"Great Professor. He's eager to teach and for his students to learn. Don't take him if you're just into getting an ""easy"" grade. Expect to read a lot  and work hard as well. Overall  his class was interesting. Besides being a great professor he's also a great person as well."
1,I personally don't like him. He is not clear with the assignments he wants  he doesn't give you the grades of the assignments you turn in until the end of the semester that you receive your final grade. Never try to reach him by email  he never answers  or ask him anything after class  instead he wants you to go to his office.
5,by far one of the more interesting and intelligent professors i have ever had. he is passionate about teaching and his energy is contageous. would take any class he offers. great as a teacher and great to just talk to about anything. highly recommend!
5,Very cool and understanding.... would recommend him anytime.... Also quite a hottie.....
3,No Comments
5,He is the hottest professor in the school!
5,What kind of promises would a professor make to a student? That's weird... this guy is the best teacher I ever had.
4.5,Good teacher  nice guy once you get to know him. Needs to work on the whole keeping promises to students thing though.
3.5,Perpetual bad mood  and doesn't keep his promises when it comes to giving students squab  but he's a pretty cool guy. Sometimes  anyway.
2,"This was a grad course on how to teach psych to undergrads. I learned so much about what NOT to do. She was disorganized  distracted  & very unclear. She wasn't able to finish grading on time due to dealing with administrative issues so she decided it would be okay to give the ENTIRE class ""Incompletes."" 2 weeks later & still no grades. Seriously?"
5,She is an amazing professor who dedicates her time to teaching and getting to know her students. The level of work is appropriate for college  meaning there is a lot of reading and your brain will be put to work. She inspires you to learn and writes amazing recommendation letters. She has a solid background in law and psychology.
5,The Best!
5,really good! hard but worth it. i learned a lot. if you want an easy A dont take this  but then you shldnt be in college if you dont want to learn!
1,"She is too narrow-minded to entertain students' comments  too lazy to ""teach"" a course with professional lectures  and gets away sitting on her behind for hours every class day watching the same movies. My final paper was more than exemplary and she couldn't see past her ignorance to appreciate its awesomeness."
2,"She took an interesting concept and presented it horribly. I don't know why she didn't include of the Spielberg classics ""Empire of the Sun."" Maybe she's not that familiar with the subject? She's very rude to the students  she has no people skills whatsoever. Maybe she's openly sadistic. I don't know what her problem is but this class was hell."
3.5,Hard grader...but i just took her for NYC film...so it wasn't that bad watch movies every week...and only had to write 3 papers all semester
1,SHE IS NEVER SATISFIED WITH ANYTHING SHE WANTS THE IN CLASS ESSAYS TO BE PERFECT  IF SHE WANTS IT TO PERFECT MIGHT AS WELL GIVE THEM IN HOME ESSAYS. SINCE I STARTED THIS CLASS I BEEN GETTING C-. I ANSWERED THE QUESTIONS BUT IT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER. I WAS TAKING THIS FOR MY MINOR BUT SHE IS GOING TO RUIN MY GPA. SHE IS SUCKS DON'T TAKE HER U W
3.5,okay prof. i really didnt like her too much.. she loves to hear herself talk and doesn't take into consideration others ideas and point of views. She wants you to notice what she notices  basically nothing is open to interpretation (and that's the whole point of taking a film class). 2 in class exams and a paper..not bad. want an A..good luck
4,If you want to get an A in this class you have to really analyze the films. Take a lot of notes and participate. I got an A- by working my ASS off. Two in class essays and one final paper. The films are pretty good too.
3,She is a hard grader but you will most likely get a B not below. So if you are border line and don't really want to stress out with hard reading and writing take her class for that English Honors minor. Nonetheless  if you want to do really well just focus on writing about what she is asking you and do not summarize the movie.. I am serious!!!
4.5,She is a hard grader. I've always had high grade in writting until her class. But if you want to graduate with an English Honors minor all you need to do is take 4 film classes. She gave me a B. She gives 3 essays and you basically just sit back and whatch movies.
3,the films are okay  her writing is hard to rd  and shes weird about how she grades
2.5,Hard grader for no obvious reason. Missed one class and did all the papers which I thought were good (with good comments)and she ended up giving me a B+. There was no clear way to get an A and she ruined my 4.0 gpa. If you don't care about having a super high gpa she's fine but if you're trying to maintain a high one don't bother.
5,The professor was excellect and insighful  she knows her stuff!!! I was happy with my B+.
3,odabashian gave me a B
4.5,I GOT AN A-. I TOOK HER TWICE!
5,You could give the best examples of film interpretation in this class  and you grade may hinge above a B. That's if you're a genius. Although the class is easy  and there are 3 essays  aim for a B to B+ because n one gets higher than that.
4,Beware you can't get higher than a B!
3.5,She was obviously a film major and gives great insight into the films as well as surrounding political events at the time the film was produced/debuted.
3,There is no required TEXT. Weekly movies with no homework. It doesn't get easier than this.
4.5,I enjoyed the class and the professor is very nice. Class meets only once a week and she assigns only three essays.
3,He's a very easy grader but this isn't an easy A. The classes are a bit tedious and repetitive  and if you don't have a solid background in statistics the readings can be confusing.
5,This is a man of striking brilliance
5,A god among men.
4,I took her class in 1975 or 1976 just because she was so hot! Back then she had a great attitude and was great to look at.
1,The worst french teacher ever. My wife  who is a native french national laughed everyday.... Because I was literally being tought.... nothing! I learned more at home. I paid for this class?....Aviod this one guys. Don't let the other posts fool you. Its confusing and ridiculous. Not easy either.
5,please..you dont need to study for that class. you come  sit  get an A. your brain is not worked at all. if you're looking just to get an A in foreign language requirements  take fre 101 and 102 with her. easy A
4.5,In the beginning of the course u'll find her difficult  but tht's when u r wrong....She's of great help....U have just 1 final and some quizzes....She gives homeworks  but they are damn easy and short......She was great and i took her back to back for 101 & 102...TAKE HER for an easy A
4.5,GOOD PROFESSOR!!!
4.5,I THINK SHE IS A GOOD PROFESSOR  JUST MORE BOARD WORK IS NEEDED.
1,shes getting paid for this? better yet... you want me to pay for this?!
2,While passing the class with an A is pretty simple as long as you pass all the simple requirments its pretty much a fend for yourself atmotsphere if your really in the class to learn. The prof picks favorites and not-so-favorites. but she shows movies and the homeworks a cinch.
2,Even though she gave me an A-  I cannot  in good conscience  give her a good review. She is a horrible teacher. Even though I have a great grade  I have learned next to nothing. I just hope I will be prepared for Fre 102.
3.5,Take her if you want an easy A and HAVE to take a language course. However if you are interested in learning french truley still take her because you want an easy A anyway you can get it right? But seriously if you want to learn french in her class you must really practice and persue it on your own because she is just a little too light for a true
4,Nice and understanding. If you are sick tell her before class! duh.. if it's a medical condition she will understand. Also  I had a B in her class and learned. But  if you don't practice on your own  forget about learning French..Practice is the fun part..oui!
4,Take her if you want an easy A!!!!!!!!! she is soo easy!
4,i liked this professor i thought she was fair   helpful and mad class fun   most of the stuff she did was jus show us alot of french movies. Which taught me the language better lol . not but i did catch up on some sleep. but review the movies because it will be on her exams.
1,No Comments
1.5,she has stinking attidude.she grades based on how she likes the person and if u know some french automatically you will pass with an A.she insists on participation and she catches an attitude if u want to be very clear on a topic.take prof.Alexandre for french.
2,If you are French or know French she will give you a good grade. If you are trying to learn French don't take her because she will not teach you a thing. Do not come to class sick she will discriminate against you.I think her attitude stinks and there have been many complaints against her.

5,A pleasure to have this professor. Very precise  helpful and a great sense of humor. Would take her again
4.5,Like most people said  yes. She is tough grader  but not impossible to get an A. I love her class becasue she is so considerate professor. show her that you try  and you do your best  then you will be fine with her.
1,She's a gpa killer in ISP. You should try to avoid her.
1,She is a bitter professor. Not happy with anything you do  but does not give you enough help to do good.
4.5,she keeps class fun and interesting and thats not easy to do with any LIT class...plus i was one of the clowns that was always being stupid in the back of the classroom and she would let us get away with it as long as we were joking about the reading and the SSSHHHHHHHHHHing girl in the back. U would understand if u took the class.
4.5,love the accent....hard readings that you must do to be pepared EVERYDAY for a quiz...
2.5,Very vague and not specific as to what requirements are in regards to assignements
5,If every professor was like Dr Allen  we all would be inspired. She is absolutely great.
5,Very good professor. Pretty tough on writing errors  but she helped me when I got behind in the work due to personal issues. Very kind  good and sweet person.
5,Awesome professor! Great teaching style. I took this class on line and its a lot of work but she makes it fun - she knows her stuff.
5,She is understanding and interesting. Just pay attention to her. She knows her stuff.
4.5,I took the online course. Lots of reading/writing essays or answering questions  but not a difficult course. Professor is understanding  helpful  and she gives credit for whatever work you submit. Read the material  participate  and you'll do fine in the class!
5,She is very helpful. Pay attention to deadlines and participate  and you'll have no problems.
4.5,she offers a great lit class online  shes very fiar  and pay attention to everything you write  without improper judgement
4,You will like the class if you love to read and write. She is a very nice and fair teacher.
5,Wonderful professor! Taught me everything I needed to know to work as a forensic psychologist in a prison. He knows his material from working in the real world - a wonderful change from boring professors that only teach theory and research!One of the best  if not THE BEST professors I ever had.!
1.5,He is a kind old fellow  but sometimes gets lost in mid thought  he goes off on more tangents than my grandma with alzhiemers  but many of his tangentsa are interesting an informative. He trys hard to get students to think independently  and I like that. Although he is a pessimist at heart. I thought he robbed me on my grade  but he did not agre
4,"He's the real deal! He occasionally misses class because he has been flown to dangerour wartorn parts of the world where his expertise is required. He once had to leave early to catch a flight but was enjoying the class discussion. When a student reminded him he had a flight to catch he said  ""It's ok. It's a military flight. They'll wait."""
4,He's a tough grader  will call on everyone for answers  and expects you to act and think scholarly. What's wrong with that  though? You're in college and that too a senior college and not community college. If you can't handle basic studying then real life's got surprises for you. Be ready to work but also be ready to learn.
5,Youre going to read a lot. He is not easy. He also doesnt tolerate slackers. In other words  he's the real deal for a professor. I didn't pay for a dumbed down education. Blitz takes students seriously and demands a lot. And that's what you should want. It's only been 4 weeks  and this is already my favorite class. Then again  I'm here to learn.
2,Get ready to read ALOT! We basically read articles that were pointless throughout the semester and got quizzed on them. Blitz is also a confusing guy  he may seem like an intelligent guy  but he often goes TOO FAR with the point he's making and totally loses you. Avoid if possible.
5,I'm a freshman second semester. My friend was signed up for Blitz class and convinced me to take it with her. I am very glad I did. Prof. Blitz class is fun but also serious about the idea of worlds. He can be funny but also makes you think totally new thoughts about everything. He has a nice coteacher who has her own style which is very nice.
4,Professor Bltiz is a great professor. He really makes class interesting and great. He does have quizzes which I found kind of ridiculous as they were a bit tough. But make sure you do all his readings and homework and you will pass the class and his quizes. Also participate and actually try! Its all worth it.
3.5,He's a good teacher. He really cares about everyone he's teaching and gives over some valuable life skills and tips. He's also very interesting teacher. funny.
3.5,he could be a little tough but if you pay attention to what is being taught and make the effort to correct your errors it will definitely boost your grade and get a higher grade in class.
1,Expect a lot of work. Very confusing and hard for no reason. The class was long and boring  and i didn't learn anything. AVOID.
5,Has a good rep and they're right. He is amazing. Told us first day that he won't bore us but we're not allowed to bore him! Better do your work tho. Great prof.
5,I had professor B for 5 classes and now a 6th. Obviously I think he is a great teacher. If you do the reading and writings on time  and participate you can do well. A lotta reviews say he is scary which I totally get but it's mainly because he wants you to work hard. He also does not tolerate foolishness.
5,2nd week of class. Love it love it love it. Professor Blitz has a reputation that he's very demanding and scary. Maybe that's how it will be  but after two double-period classes  he's already my favorite professor out of 5 previous semesters.
5,I loved Professor Blitz! I took a class with him and Professor Sarna and it was amazing! Granted  it's a lot of work  so expect that! But he makes the content fun and is able to relate to the students. Great professor! And if it's an ISP class  you don't need a textbook!
4.5,He made us think about multiple futures. He made everyone give 2 mini lectures in the semester. I still can't believe he connected microscopes to time machines to multiple infinities and didn't lose me. Hardest class ever. Best class ever. Wish I could take him every semester.
5,Hard class if you want to pass gotta do all the work!
4.5,My 3 tips for anyone taking a class with Blitz: 1) do NOT come to class unprepared. 2) participate. 3) enjoy yourself. He is awesome. A little scary sometimes but he really wants his students to do well.
5,Teaches with Sarna. Both are great. Blitz can be hilarious but is also VERY serious about students doing their work. He seems to know a LOT about a LOT of things. Never boring  tough grader  not tolerant of laziness AT ALL. Probably best teacher I've had at JJ.
4.5,He's intelligent but also challenging. He wasn't as difficult as I thought but you definitely need work hard.
5,Professor Blitz and Sarna were both great teachers. They don't give any tests  however they do give a few pop quizzes and some are scheduled on the syllabus. No textbook use but you will be reading several books. I would have to say that Professor Blitz was a difficult class to pass but well worth the challenge. I've improved my writing tenfold.
5,Didn't realize how famous he was until I came here  LOL. On THAT note: YES! He's tough  fair but intimidating & will make you WORK for that grade. (Prof Sarna is gr8 as well!) You will NOT succeed if you're excessively absent/lazy. I HATED participating and he picked up on it so he would make me do it but it's all to make you better as a student!
5,On the first day I was warned by other students.BUT I find him to be brilliant  thought-provoking  funny  and very engaging. People in my classes love him. I hate participating  but he challenged me in a great way. I've been taking his courses ever since. Please don't slam the door. Be conscious - he is great. Period.
1,Horrible professor. Unorganized and thinks he knows everything. He is very boring and is not a fair grader. The final and final paper are on the same day. I beg anyone who even thinks of taking him to think again and run! If you have to stay at John Jay an extra semester just so you won't have to take him it is worth it! Don't take him!!!
1,KEEP AWAY!!!!! This man is boring   miserable and sucks at grading. He weill lose your work and won't hand it back until it is too late to drop the course. I almost left John Jay because of him. If I had to I would skip a semester just so I wouldn't have to take him again. Poor excuse for a professor or therapist.

1.5,He's very boring and is ridiculous in grading papers. Basically if you want an A on a paper you have to dumb down your writing. If you write a paper that sounds like it came out of a real psychology journal (ie. a good paper) then he won't like it. The text is written by him and seems to be written for a 3rd grader.
1,One of the worse professors I've ever had. Just a short man with a personality to match. God help anyone who has him as a teacher or therapist.
3,he is a little boring teaches straight from his textbook. Only paper  midterm and final. Just show up and pay attention and it's fine.
1.5,I had him for an internship advisor....he made me not want to do ANYTHING in psychology. He shoots down your dreams
2,I needed two hits of expresso in order to stay awake. His tests are extremely hard and the third test and final are on the same date...Half of my class failed him  I was one of the few lucky ones just because I can write good papers. He is brilliant psychologist  but he should not be teaching
2,Do not take this class if you want to keep your sanity. He is extremely hard on tests. On the day of the final you have your 3rd exam  plus cumulitive final which encompasses roughly 15 chapters. Stay away.
2,BORING!!!!!! If you dont fall asleep in this guy's class  you might catch him falling asleep himself. He makes no sense  is all over the place  and its painful to make it thru the 2 hours...so far the test was OK if you read the 300 page research articles
4,Lowry is a great acting teacher! Don't be afraid of her  she has great things to share. Imagine Brown's theatre program without Lowry - it would be pretty weak. Tons of experience and insight  and has always been warm and approachable.
1,I studied with Lowery over 10 years ago. She is with out question the worst acting teacher I have had the misfortune of working with. It took me years to get over her petty favoritism and her constant over selling.
1.5,so sick of her dog by now
2,I have found Lowry to be among the most judgemental  difficult  uncaring professors I have ever had. To those she preselects as her favorites  she is very kind. If you're not on her A list  watch out.

5,He is a great prof at John Jay college. I took his SOC343 class 2016Spring. Take home midterm and open book final  A short proposal paper  a research paper 15page long. That was all. He showed us a lot of great documentaries most of class time. And he really cares about his students. Take him
5,Great professor!!!! Open book midterm  10 page paper  and open book final
4,Professor Brotheron is a very cool professor. He does not expect much of u. The midterms are open book. The final is a take home.He gives 15 page term paper thats due at the end of the semester. Overall he is very funny and he makes u want to come to class.

5,He has a hot British accent that makes you want to listen to anything he says. He is quite droolworthy.

1,Horrible  he just reads off the slides and talks to the board. He has a thick accent so you can barely understand him.
4.5,I am the worst student in the world when it comes to math but he really keeps it simple. He gives plenty of examples in class and helps you understand the material. The class is hard to begin with but I can finally say this is one math class I passed. He has an accent but it's not hard to understand him. Tip: Do the homework! It helps.
2.5,Not a bad teacher  just a tough subject although he can be hard to understand sometimes. You have to pay attention because he does not really review past lectures. If you miss classes chances are you wont do so well on the tests.
1,Obviously he knows the material  however does not have a clue on how to teach it. He is very confusing. He does not go over enough examples in class - he just likes to hear himself talk and recite his own notes which he has memorized.Math is all about stimulation and practice and he provides ZERO of any of that. Overall he is terrible at teaching
2,Only take him if you are already interested in math. Otherwise he will be hard to understand  both because he is dull and has a thick accent. He reads off of the slides a lot  and makes no effort to make it interesting if you struggle with the subject.
5,Lesli is a wonderful professor. No math subject is easy  you always have to do a lot of work. I extremely recommend him.
2,All his class is a review from the textbook!
1,this guy is a joke.....DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU WANT A PASSING GRADE  he is a good person  horrible teacher.
4,He's great. Really lays the material out in a comprehensible fashion. If you have a problem  he always stops what he is doing to answer your question and makes sure you understand before continuing
4.5,Great Professor. Could be the first math professor I've met with a sense of humor. He is a very fair grader and clarifies the material well.
5,Great prof! Gives VERY CLEAR explanations. Your present mind is required in class if you want to get a good grade!I do not know why other rewievs blame him  because he is extremely helpful and precize. If you still did not get it - blame yourself!!!
3.5,wooow ... idk who are rating this prof... might be students who wants to do nothing in college and get an A so sad... hes a great proffesor if u dont understand something he will explain it to u again ... i learn so much and teaches great take him ... took him in a winter course and got an A
3,okay
4,Very great and helpful professor. Take him for the summer. Knows his work and has excellent teaching skills. Goes over work until you understand it. Gives 1 to 2 HW assignments per wk (200 problems total drops 100 and is 15% of your grade an easy boost)& gives 4 exams dropping the lowest. COME TO CLASS & DO YOUR HW & WILL DO GREAT! TAKE HIM!
5,Best professor in john jay to teach math! he mad the class so easy and amazing.. gives hwk once a week and dropest the lowest test grade! Amazing!
2.5,This professor is sooo hard to understand. Every class I attended felt like it was a review. He doesn't teach as if it's everyone's first time  he teaches as though you should know all the material. Very bad!
5,he is the best math teacher ver homework for this class is online and he gives a week to do it. he gives a lot of notes but if u copy them they will definatly pass the test he gives 3 test (no midterm)and a fianl. he also drops the lowest test grade i love him hes one of the best math teacher at john jay.
3.5,THIS PROFESSOR IS NO JOKE  HE ACTUALLY FAILS PEOPLE WHO CAN'T PASS THE TESTS I WENT TO TUTORING EVERYDAY STILL ENDED  up with a C+
1.5,I dont know why the comments on him got reset.. He is terrible period avopiod him at all costs..
2,This Professor is garbage. He will make you use an outside service that charges a fee  gives not leniency towards anything  is difficult to understand and simply does not give a sh&% about his students. Hes good at Math but not at being a teacher. This is not MIT Professor...
3,He's a little man with a gigantic ego. Loves to hear himself talk. Definitely knows his stuff  but a poor teacher. Very poor.
5,Excellent Prof!
5,This professor is awsome!!!!! He is a great person that knows his staff. His classes are fun and well organized.
5,I have had Todd as a professor on and off for 4 years now and he is a great guy. You can learn a lot from him and he is always there to help students with anything. He is charismatic and his classes are not hard. They just rely on a lot of theory and experience as opposed to textbook facts. He really knows what he's teaching.
4,(Sorry but I don't know off-hand what the course number is!). The guy is full of himself. It's easy to do well in his class since the only thing that he really cares about is if you can give his own words and thoughts back to him. Comes off as a nice guy  but his ego is taller than he is.
2.5,THE CLASS IS NOT HARD  HOWEVER WHETHER YOU PARTICIPATE OR NOT  IT DOESN'T COUNT. YOU DONT NEED 2 BUY THE BOOK TO PASS.
4.5,He was really good at explaining everything and we always had the chance to ask questions without feeling like he was going to snap at us. Class requires you to think more openly and it helps to understand the criminal justice system better. Take Him!!!!
1,Can his ideas work in the real world?
1,He is an international figure in the world of criminal justice and an incredible academic. Just not a great professor~
5,prof clear is an awesome teacher. very knowledgable and informative. cordial and friendly with students. uses interesting anecdotes and tidbits to make information relative. has a great teaching manner. take his classes if you can.
1.5,felt like corrections was totally unimportant after taking his class.
3,WASN'T THAT GREAT OF A TEACHER
4,After her class she sends some students to take CATW again.I took CATW and I passed so I skipped EAP
4,Although she is a little tough but if you do everything on time you will be fine. She is good teacher
4,You have to work really hard in order to be successful in this class. By the way  she gives many paragraphs and stories to read each class. After that  you have to provide a response of the story. There are many paper that has been given each class  so you have to be really responsible of keep track of all of your stuff and work.
2.5,She chooses monotonous books to read about court session  criminals and jury. On top of that  she gives a little time to read  100-120 pages for example  2-3 days  and students must analyze and bring citations with typed responds. We should have a spare time on weekend  should not we?
2,Do not take her any way
4,You have to study hard in order to pass her class. Attendance and class participation are mandatory. Homeworks every day.
4.5,Extremely helpful professor if you are interested enough. She gives a lot of homework  attendance is mandatory  no lateness. Work hard and you will get everything you need for you to go further. I would recommend her to every non-native student in order to have a good start in your academic career
4.5,It will all depends on what you are in for . If you need to learn something i will highly recommend her   if you still live in the high school bubble stay away . She will make fun of you . This professor helped me a lot and actually respect her students. She is also great on the human level.
2.5,She is nice and professional. I would recommend her
4,SHE IS TOUGH  HARD GRADER  AND WILL CLOSE THE DOOR ON YOU IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE LATE. AT TIMES HER CLASS IS BORING  AND SHE REPEATS HERSELF TOO MUCH. SHE HARDLY RECOMMENDS STUDENTS TO TAKE THE ACT TEST AFTER HER CLASS  AND NOT BECAUSE THEY DON'T DESERVE IT. IT WAS HARD TO PASS THIS CLASS  NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU WORKED.
1,DON'T TAKE HER CLASS
5,She is the Best Proffesor  a little tough  but is okay. You have to listen tand do the assignments
5,She is hard but not that hard don't get scared she may give a lot of homework but it is easy to talk to her . She helped me a lot and I would take her again if I have the chance.Remember if u need help with english take her and any way step by her office with any english problem I can guaranty u will come out with no problem.
5,she is good but gives a lot of homework
2,It is not for your own good. I was not happy with her.
5,she is such a sweet old lady....she cares so much that sometimes its smothering...but its for your own good..she does give ALOT of work though.
5,She is a very good profesor. She cares about her students a lot. She gives a lot of work but it is for your own good. i've learned a lot in her class and i am really thankfull for that. Before i took her clss i was making so many grammar mistakes  but she helpe and i improved a lot
1,No Comments
5,She can be hard but it is for your own good. You will really learn a lot. Her class will help you to succeed in other English classes.
3.5,No Comments
5,One of the easiest prof I have ever taken. Easy A. Just study the hand outs he goes over during class and you'll ace the midterm and final. He def knows his stuff. Easy class to enjoy and easy A for sureeee....
5,cool old guy i would make everyone laugh in the back of the room easy class a little boring but easy no homework or nuthing =] just sheets you do in class OFFICER CURRAN LOL
5,He was an excellent professor. If you come in late  he will blow up your spot  but if you have some days when you cant make it to class  he is forgiving and a very respectful professor to his students. Very knowledgable in Police Science and even with Politics. I would definately take his class again.
3,easy come to class get a hand out and two exams mid-term and final 80 questions each multiple choice  but he is booooooooooring.
5,Good professor. Very knowledgeable. Basically class consists of reading (aprx. 30 pages/wk)  class worksheets  midterm + final. Class can be boring  but he is very nice  and knows his stuff. put in the effort and you will get an A.
4.5,he is very easy but talks alot about his ownself.you will have to study by ur self to knwo the material other wise hez just good professor.tkae him i got A
5,Yes this class is extremely easy however u really do have to do good in the final and midterm....only 1 midterm and 1 final...10 sheets which we do in class and together..also the sheets r the study sheets..very nice guy!
5,One of the sweetest people you ever want to meet. He encourages you to get involve with the daily lessons and explains everything to you in details. Highly rec.
5,easy A  in fact its so easy I got one even though I thought the class was math 108 ROFL im so smart!
4,"Basically a midterm & a final. ""In every 2 classes  a sheet with 10 questions based on the chapters of the textbook is given. After completing the sheets  they are used as study guides"". He knows his stuff but you can easily fall asleep in his class."
4.5,This professor is AWESOME! he is such a pleasant down to earth Man. His class is a piece of cake  you got to do a 5 page paper  and midterm n final. we didnt use the book that much  because the subject explains all. he is not tough at all. I would recommend him for any class  ALL WE DID WAS LISTEN  HE IS TOO EASY!! N REAL FRIENDLY~
5,During the beginning of the course you would think he is a good professor. As the course progresses  you come to realize that he is a GREAT professor. Very tough on his students at times  but very impartial. Recommend him if you are serious about learning!
4,A midterm & a final  that's pretty much it. In every 2 classes  a sheet with 10 questions based on the chapters of the textbook is given. After completing the sheets  they are used as study guides for the midterm & final + both exams are multiple choice & true/false questions. Easy class  no HW &/or term paper.
5,Attendance is very important in his class  there is one midterm and final exam  very easy multiple choice  if you read the book you will get an easy A in that class cause the exam is related to the book. Gives quizzes in class but they are few questions and he lets you use the book so its open quiz. Come to class and easy grade. No papers either.
3,This professor was so nice and intresting at first... he goes off on tangents bragging about family  its annoying. you have to have pretty much perfect attendance  he takes lateness very personally. somewhat condescending.
4.5,He is a great professor. very helpful. I liked his class  and enjoyed doing his assignments. You must go to tutoring to better yourself. He is funny as well. pretty cool guy.
5,Imagine Ichabod Crane with a nice wardrobe. That's about what Prof. Crozier looks like. In some weird way  it's incredibly charming. And the humane learnedness another reviewer mentioned adds to his appeal. That  and the fact that there are very few people on this planet from whom you can learn more.
5,Hes great  I had him a couple of semesters ago and Im upset he doesnt teach there anymore. He only gives 3 tests  essay based but really simple...he even lets you use the book/notes. Hes really funny and a very brilliant man  makes the class interesting.
5,He is definitely the best instructor  the most humane and learned I've ever had.
1,He is the worst professor I have ever had. Do yourself a favor and don't take this man.
5,This guy is way cool. He may seem kinda strange but he's one amazing teacher. He tries so much and though a test every class or every other class is nothing.
5,One of the best professors I have ever taken. No exams  no textbooks. Great professor and easy class.
5,(Taken - Fall 2014) I was so happy to have a professor like him in my first semester of college. He is hilarious. He's fun to work with. We did research  which was super fun! (My class got to do research on sex work comparing different groups of people)
5,Prof Curtis is so funny! His class is very much laid back but be prepared to do a paper every week the paper topics are not hard or lengthy (500 words) just make sure you do them. No exams and he is active in his field and encourages his students to join him in research.
5,Hes so adorable!! TAKE HIM! he lectures a lot but theyre very interesting. hes an excellent anthropologist  and he always has amazing stories to share. he gives a lot of assignments but you have the whole semester to do them  his assignments are very simple. Easy A !
5,"Prof. Curtis is hilarious. He says ""yo"" a lot XD lol His class is really easy"
5,An easy teacher a few homeworks but no test. You will leave this class actually learning something.
5,Great professor who's very knowledgeable in what he teaches. Class is never dull. Learned a pile from his class. Definitely would retake.
5,No tests  a few readings and a final project. Hilarious guy  would take again if I could  MUST TAKE
5,Great professor Funny Had a few response papers due - tough grader  but great feedback Very laid back class HIGHLY recommended
5,hes really funny and cool  I would love to take him again
5,GREAT teacher. Really fun  nice guy  has a great sense of humor  and everything is very easy.
5,Best teacher I've had so far. He's very funny  you just have to show up to class and do the essays he gives for homework. There aren't many  it's based on readings he put on e-reserve and it's just your opinion about it. You don't need a textbook for him. Super easy going and friendly. He has some pretty interesting life stories also.
5,Awesome Guy. Kiss up to him and you will get an easy A+. He doesn't really care about the work. He cares about attendance though  he makes fun of people who don't show up. He just tells stories all day in class and doesn't put stress on people AT ALL. Take him for ANY CLASS he teaches. He will make you love Anthropology and can even get you a job.
5,He is the def the coolest and chillest teacher in the world! He has many research opportunities and he really believes you learn by doing instead of just reading and studying! It was a very fun class and we got out early almost every time.
5,AWESOME professor. very helpful great sense of humor. totally cool guy.take him for any ant course.
4.5,BEST PROF EVER!!! No textbook! Mo midterm or finals  just easy papers! He's awesome and has a good sense of humor. Take him!
5,Snapple face 120: you can't get better then Ric
5,Prof. Curtis is one of the my favorite professors I have taken thus far. I took his class 8:15 in the morning  but it was the best. He is very wise. No textbook  no mid-term or final...just a 1 pg paper every week pertaining to drug/alcohol  and a 6-8 final paper. He is one of the funniest people I have ever met  you will def enjoy his class.
5,Prof. Curtis is one of my favorite professors I've ever taken...I had his class 8:15 in the morning  but it was the best. No textbook  no mid-term or final just a 1 pg paper every week pertaining to drug/alcohol  and a final paper 6-8 pgs. One of the funniest people I've ever met. Def recommend him you will have a lot of fun...I guarantee it.
5,Awesome guy. Good sense of humor. Easy class. Lots of interactive class discussions on a wide range of topics (school/life related  etc.) Never needed to take notes for this class..ever. Weekly assignments due  very short (500 words) and easy. A couple of longer papers due at the end but not hard at all. Great prof. RECOMMENDED!!
4,I was excited to learn Anthropology but I should of taken another Professor. He is ok I guess but pretty much the only thing he taught us was the definition of Anthropology  go to youtube and watch random videos. We had only one test and 2 papers. I prefer tests because I hate writing. He is a good professor but I would of wished I learned more.
4,I was not intending to take this class at first but kojo is one of the most influential professors at john jay. He loves anthropology. You watch alot of video's and movies. You write 2 papers he substitues for tests & a final paper which is 7-10 pages. Just show up and make sure he gets to know you his memory isnt the best.
4.5,I took Kojo Dei's class close to 15 years ago and to this day he stands out as one of the most influential professors in my academic career. I wish I had taken his advice and gone on for forensic anthropology at Columbia. He always made himself available for questions after class. Im not sure where the other comments are coming from.
1,Throughout the semester I thought I was doing great! The lowest mark I got on his paper was a B! I was never absent in class always participated and at the end I receive a C! I try to talk to him to change the grade he is never there! He is so disorganized! He doesn't know what he is looking for as for the work! All he does is talk about Africa. I was very disappointed and I'm appealing the grade because he doesn't know what he is doing. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS!
2.5,You might think this class is easy because all you have to do is watch youtube videos  and write some essays. But it's not! He hardly likes anything you hand in  and just gives bad grades. So if u want to get a B or B- then go ahead and take his class!
3,No textbooks  no midterms  no quizzes  no finals. 3 papers (2 responses and 1 final paper). Your presentation is based on your final paper. Attendance is mandatory (usually sign-in sheet). If you do not write the way he wants you to write  expect a highest of a B-. Hard to understand him but his style of teaching is recommended. Just participate!
1,Don't take his class! All he does is show youtube videos and gives out only 2 articles so the entire semester. There are two response papers and a final research paper with a presentation to go with it. He's completely irrational when it comes to grading. Don't take a chance. Attendance is sometimes called out or sign in sheet. This guy is a mess!
5,CLASS IS EASY AND NOT TEXT BOOKS. MOST CLASSES ARE VIDEO WHICH HELPS IF U TAKING HARD CLASSES NO TEXT BOOKS AND 3 EASY WRITING ASSIGNMENTS.
1,WORSTTTTTT PROF EVERR! A WASTE OF TIME. he cant spell and he is hard to understand. He is not very open minded about other people's writing. He expects you to write just like him. All he do is go on you tube and watch videos and he Grades Hard!
1,What can I say about this man? He is nice  but the course was a waste of time. Very disorganized and confused. He only stresses your final paper in my opinion. Don't buy the books. For some odd reason  he grades too harshly. If you don't write like him or agree with his points-expect a C+. What a semester. I did learn how to master you tube though!
1.5,Really easy class. Take him if you have a lot of hard classes on your schedule and want an easy A. Requires a few papers but the rest of the time you just watch youtube videos in class. More of a discussion class if anything. I haven't learned a thing from him  only the videos.
3.5,Prof. Kojo is def. unique. he never had any lesson plans though & we just watched youtube videos all class. no need for the txtbook & doesn't give any tests but just 2 papers which were fair. Students use to always walk in after class and just sign the attendance sheet because the class would be in complete darkness while videos were running. haha
4,He's a smart man  he should remain more objective though.
3,If you enjoy watching youtube videos and only do 2 papers (4-5 pages) and 1 presentation for the whole year then this class is for you  an easy A. Those are the ONLY assignments you will get in the class.
1,horrible professor! doesn't teach at all just shows us youtube videos. if this class isn't mandatory then don't take it. biggest waste of my money. i could watch youtube videos at my house for free.
3.5,best professor at john jay easy easy easy A all he recuires is a paper
3.5,awesome professor i recommend taking him.. class is fun and theres not much writing
4,Easy Professor no test no quizes just 1 paper. The papaer is very easy you can just make it up and get a A. Watch good flicks in this class. Take this professor for an easy A or B
1,"Prof Kojo is a really easy professor to take ANT101 with......as long as you write your papers according to his own opinions. If you differ with what he believes basically expect to get nothin better than a ""c"". Plus you don't learn much in his class. Mostly just reviewing the daily news and talking about random issues of the day. No test given."
2,No Comments
5,EXCELLENT PROFESSOR!!!!! ONLINE CLASS EASY A. WISH HE TAUGHT MORE CLASSES ONLINE.
4,Took his class online very easy stay on top of the syllabus it tells you ahead what the work is only missed one discussion board but did well on everything else be sure to cite answers from the book and paper 5-7 pages cite from things you covered in the book easy A very clear on what he wants put in effort even half way you'll pass trust
5,the online class is very easy just answer the discussion questions and respond to others. Thats it . Easy A
5,Keep up with the discussion boards. Answer the entire question and comment on othe posts and pj will get full credit. He posts very interesting comments. No midterm no final. 3-5 page paper at end of course
1.5,Gosh  when I took this course (PSC 101) fall 2013 I saw that he had good rating so I decided to take him. I don't know why some people rated him 5 stars on easiness. you can NOT really understand his lecturers. his voice are very low and exams are hard Plus 10 pages term papers. The worse class I have ever had. DO NOT TAKE HIM.
3,Don't do it  his tests are not checked  making some answers wrong that are right. He's hard to understand  thinks he is ALWAYS right. My last year in college and he's by far the worst professor I've had as of yet.
4.5,Ok if you take him for the 400 level class it's not as easy as everyone says. He requires a 24 page paper  short assignments  final  midterm  presentation etc so if you do take his class be prepared to come with the mindset to do work. Senioritis is not allowed overall he explains well and if you do your work you will be fine.
5,Easiest Professor IN THE WORLD. Purhapse TOO EASY. TOO CLASS ONLINE. Textbook is a MUST. READ SHORT Passages  anwers questions. ITS THAT EASY. NO MID TERMS!!!! NO FINALS. FALL 2012
5,Great professor. As long as you show up for class and participate you will pass. 2 short papers and a take home final... Ill be taking him for another class for sure.
3,took this course online i missed few posts  so got a lower grade - can be easy class if you do all the posts. no final no midterm  just the posts.
4,Professor Delcastillo is a good professor  but could be very boring at times. Very easy class  failing or getting a poor grade in this class would be ashame  if you do  you might want to speak with your counselor.
5,Great teacher really funny. Pretty easy all you gotta do is like 4 reaction papers on a question in the textbook. 1 midterm 1 final. tests are a little tricky just study a little and you will be fine..i recomend him
5,If I had to dream up the best online professor  It wouldn't come close to professor DelCastillo! He is awesome! Answers emails very quickly  and offers help if requested without a rude answer. Takes the time to write out key points of chapters and posts examples. no midterm  no final  just perfect
5,This teacher rocks!! Class is very easy no midterm no final just answer 2 questions on blackboard every week answer come (straight out of the book) you have to be real lazy  and stupid to fail this class.Teacher answer all his emails is very helpful and friendly. Follow the his instructions and you can not fail. He is the BEST online teacher at jja
5,"Prof. Delcastillo is one of the best if not ""The"" best online professor john jay has. No midterm or final everything comes from the reading. Pay careful attention to his instructions and you will do fine. Great class you learn lots wish he taught more classes at john jay."
5,EASY A TAKE HIM ONLINE READ THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWER THEM.....BACK TO ELEMENTARY SCH0OL. ONE OF THE BEST ONLINE CLASSES TO TAKE... GREAT SUBJECT MATERIAL TOO. OVER ALL 5 OUTA 5 EASY EASY EASY
2,You have to work for your grade. Do all your assgn's on time and you'll get a good grade. Put thought into your answers. I would give him a 4/5 because afterall  it is college.
2,This class is not an easy A! You have to work for your grade. Each Wk you have to answer 2 questions about a prg or more each and give a clear explanation. Grading is #/10 for each week's assgn. I didn't know how to post the first one  so i emailed it and got a 0/10! (zero!) The prof did not accept any excuses. Do your work on time! You'll be fine.
4,Easy ASS online course. You are given 1 or 2 discussion board questions and 1 short answer question(treated as a quiz) to be answered and submitted by Wed 11:59pm. Questions are so Easy.
5,Easy online class.
5,Best class I've ever taken. (He's now teaching at Yale.)
5,One of the best courses I've taken at Brown. He's easy-going  clear and smart.
5,fabulous teacher
5,Awesome class
3,There is 5 books to read in this class  and every single class period you have a quiz. the quizes are 65% of your grade so if you are not willing to do the readings DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS THEN. she is nice and respected but can be rude when people are rude. we only have one paper to do in that class and for the final you had to come finals week.
4,GIVES QUIZZES EVERY CLASS AND PAY ATTENTION TO ALL THE SMALL DETAILS IN THE BOOKS.
4.5,Prof. Kaplowitz is an amazing professor  she makes you read a lot though. If you don't like to read don't bother taking her class. Quizzes are done either before every class or every other class. I hated reading  God knows I still do but she makes you read interesting novels that will have you wanting to know what's next. Do the work  guaranteed A.
2.5,If you want to hurt your GPA then you can take her she is horrible a quiz in every class and the final paper is 7 to 10 pages
5,She is a very sweet professor and knows her stuff. however  there is tremendous amount of work and hard to Ace.there is a quiz every week  which end up to be 17 quizzes for the whole semester. A 5 pages final paper  lots of term definition and 5 essays on the final. an extra credit assignment but it doesn't seem to improve your grade too much
4.5,She changed my life.
3,Shes Nice  Kind of Chatty & Attempted To Make The Class Fun
2.5,THIS IS 1 OF THE WORSE PROFESSORS I'VE EVER HAD SINCE IVE BEEN AT JOHN JAY. SHE'S MEAN AND DID NOT TREAT ME WITH RESPECT. IN MY OPINION SHE PLAYS FAVORTISM. HOW COULD FAIL THE DAMN CLASS WITH PASSING THE FINAL AND PAPER AND AT LEAST PASSING SOME OF HER WORTHLESS QUIZZES. IF YOU HATE READING..I ADVISE YOU TO NOT TAKE HER.
5,Quizzes are essential  must do the readings  they are not boring  very interesting. No midterm  just a final and one paper. Gives extra credit and is very helpful. Read what you have to read and you should be golden.
5,Quizzes are very important so you must read the text.She one on John Jay's most helpful prof. I learned a lot and enjoyed every text we read sometimes readings are lengthy but its college what do you expect at least she gives an intro to every text so your not totally lost
5,Prof. Kaplowitz is one of the greatest LIT professors I've ever had the pleasure of taking. She is extremely clear  she explains everything and she answers all of your questions. There are quizzes every week but they shouldn't be a problem if you read the book.
5,Very Nice Professor if u like to read interesting novels take her..her novel selections were pretty good..JUST MAKE SURE U READ she gives a quiz almost every week so0o bee readdyy i slacked n didnt read as much as i shouldve but if u read its so0o easy n interesting i promise u! well that goes for lit 233 i dunno bout the rest shes cool overall
5,This class was great. I loved the books we read  and the quizzes (which are taken after every assigned reading) were easy as long as you read. If you can't read then you shouldn't be in college. She's very passionate about her job  and the reason shes late is because she has back problems bc she was hit by a bus a long time ago-give her a break.
4.5,suggest to take a different prof. you will learn in the class however  there are quizes everyday and the readings are about a hundred pages. no midterm just paper and final but the quizes are the majority of your grade so you can't mess up and you will get a 0 if you miss a class. not easy. no spark notes
5,SHES GOOD  THOSE PEOPLE WHO SAID HER CLASS IS HARD DONT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. ITS EASY  ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS READ. SHE GIVES QUIZZES EVERY WEEK ON THE READING. A PAPER FOR A MIDTERM AND A FINAL WHICH IS COMPARING AND CONTRASTING THE CHARACTERS FROM THE BOOKS SHE ASSIGNED. SHES EASY.COLLEGE IS ABOUT DOING YOUR WORK.
3,She is a nice person but her class is difficult esp. with the readings. She asks distinctive questions as you will have to know every single detail. Her quizes kills your grades and gets too emotional with her books. She is often late for her classes and gives quizzes every class.She also has favorites in the class so she is not fair to new ones.
1.5,Hard Class. Lots of reading!!! BORING LIT TOO!!! Quiz every week with confusing questions  and a 5 page paper at the end and a 5 essay in class final! Crazy wierd prof! Aviod her if you can. She is a sweetheart  but her class is just too hard and boring!
3.5,Difficult class... we read on an average 100 pages worth of work  quizes are hard but ask fairly general things... i would suggest getting cliff notes (even though you are not supposed to) to re-enforce the readings... it makes the book much clearer
5,wonderful
5,really cool lady. the books are all good except beloved  hated it. classes on tuesdays and thursdays  juss be aware thursdays class is just re-reading what you already read and discussing it for 75 minutes  absolute boredom if u dont like the book  like beloved. Ive taken kap b4 and would again
1,Professor Larkin is one of the rudest professors at John Jay! Very sarcastic  rude and mean in her comments on work submitted! Avoid her at all costs
1,I do not like professor Larkin. She is not helpful at all. If a student ask for help  ignores. she is so rude and strict. she does not care about students. I have never seen these type of professor.
4,Got her for beginner swimming. Shes really helpful  at first I was afraid to even fully submerge my head  but she will work with u every step of the way. By the end of the semester I was diving! Shes not always crystal clear but u get the general idea of what she wants. obv dont get rude  cuz she can be too  which is fair. dont miss too many classe
5,Dr. Sue is mad chill! Take her  Easy A. She talks about good stuff in a health class for adults!
5,Dr. Larkin is simply the best PED Prof. in PED at John Jay! I have taken 2 classes with her. She is excellent! Take PED 110 ONLINE with her it is an easy A  forget what the other people say. Se gives good feedback. PE Minor students should take her! Forget these other teachers  (they are too serious) she is the best one to take! Easy A
4.5,Easy A
5,She is awesome. Take her for online health class. Easy A (if you do the work she requires (which is not tough at all). She is always ready to help also  she is very clear and fair.
3,I thought Public health would be really interesting. Her tough grading is making me regret taking this class. I've worked very hard on all of my homework assignments but there always seems to be a problem. When she tells me to fix something and I do then something else is wrong.
4.5,LOVED HER! Larkin is an amazing professor. shes very enthusiastic and believes in her students. she will not let you give up  and will push you until you succeed Be prepared to give 110%  she doesnt like slacking  but she will give you a break if you need it. Class is fun  and you make great friends. Highly recommend her! you wont regret it
4,I learned to swim in her class & i had friends to keep me company. She just told us what to do & its fine bc i learned. there was extra credit to make up each absence & also helped to practice. A.
1.5,Supposed to be a Health course but we still did workouts. She's lucky she's a tenured prof
5,Larkin is soo nice! If you're a beginner  you will know how to swim  dive  and tread water by the time she's done with you :) Attendance is MANDATORY!!! But it's worth it  classes are fun  the water's cold  and you make great friends!
3,she doesnt get in the water  she tells u what to do and u do! Dont talk to her unless its necessary.
5,great professor. The workouts are extremely intense & the test are basically vocabulary and esay questions.As long as you're serious about working out& completing simple goals its an easy A.
5,soooooo niceeeee  take her during the summer she is a garenteed A
5,I dont know what the hell these guys are going on about she is absolutely the sweetest person in the school. Classes were a breeze  literally have the lectures posted up on blackboard so no missing any notes. Exams she would go over with you before class. She doesnt expect you to be a rocket scientist ... just want you to live a healthy lifestyle.
5,She is not as bad as these people are saying. She is fun and if you do the labs(which are easy) and read the book  the class is a breeze.
5,She is really mean and messed uppp wen shes on her period!! but shes is great person... Her swimming class was great!!!!!!!

1,MEAN. NASTY ATTITUDE.
5,There's a quip a minute as Professor Handschuh does his standup in front of the class  but what you don't realize is how much you are learning about Journalism  Photojournalism  the business of Journalism and the continuing need to keep up with the technology. David truly cares about the students and you'd be fortunate to get into his class.
5,I had Prof. Handschuh for Photojournalism almost nine years ago. I'm now working full time as a journalist and looking back at his class  I realized:1-He told and taught us things that NO other professor in ANY journalism class brought up for discussion and2-He was spot on  100 percent RIGHT on his assessment of Journalism as a career.THANKS David
5,Professor Handschuh is a caring  entertaining and informative educator. While the class is Photojournalism  he teaches about the business of photojournalism and emotional care for journalists and how to market yourself as a photographer or writer and this is really valuable information. Highly recommended class!
2.5,Brought good resources into the class from being a photojournalist  but judging by his effort this is clearly his side job. Means well but I was definitely expecting more guidance.
1.5,I was expecting more?
5,Professor Handschuh is a real working journalist and his classroom lectures have helped me understand the world of journalism in ways that no other instructor have in four years of college. He has a great sense of humor and really can teach his students how to be a better journalist and photojournalist.
5,Great teacher  but tough grader. Very helpful in explaining professional guidlines  clearly loves to teach others about photography. Decent sense of humor. Good class. Be prepared to take LOTS of pictures.
5,Really cares about his students. Great practical advice for journalism students  not just photojournalism. One of the best professors I've had at NYU.
5,Take this course as one of your early basic courses...great work-up on presentations  power points  and essay papers..instructor videos each session and class provides feedback..priceless!
5,My entire life has changed because of this professor. He gets inside you so deep and brings out strengths and talents  not to mention ideas  you never knew you had. No one has ever had such a profound and positive effect on me.
5,This has been the most fascinating class I have ever taken. I loved every minute of it. I am thankful that I had taken his class. I certainly recommend anyone to take his course. He is an excellent professor and should be tenure!!
5,"Never had a a professor that opened my eyes and my mind like Eli Amdur did. He invented this course ""Creativity Change  and the 21st Century Leader"" and it's the most useful  inspiring  and fun course I ever took. His approach is so inclusive and engaging and he is a world of knowledge and wisdom. I see the whole world differently now."
5,the most amazing professor that I meet in FDU  very inspiring and interesting. Recommend him strongly
5,Great prof  and one of the best I ever took class with
5,Eli has continued to be a mentor of mine several years after I took his course. Simply fantastic!
5,Simply stupendous. should take this professor. Extremely helpful for your future.
5,Professor Amdur is one of the greatest teachers. His inspiring  thought-provoking discussions about leadership were invaluable.
5,SWEET!!!
5,He's so creative that he even created this course: Creativity  Change  and the 21st Century Leader. FDU should bottle what he's got and feed it to the other profs. He's smart  caring  exciting  inspiring  and fun. And he gives you his all every day. Best class by a long shot and best professor by even a longer shot.
5,He is a wonderful professor. His class always full of energy  depth and fun. If you are a student from another country  his class will really help you open your self  see the world from a new light. He teaches much more than you could learn from a textbook. He is definitely my NO 1 professor.
5,I had Prof. Amdur for Exec Comm & Leadership- In 5 years @ FDU I have never met a better teacher! It was a great way to end my time @ FDU. BEST PROFESSOR. Really getes to know the students & is always willing to help & listen!
5,Never in my life have I met a Professor that can connect with students the way he does. Not only is he a very very knowledgeable man  but his work experience also complements his style of teaching. Professor Amdur teaches because he really loves what he does and most importantly cares for his students  something that many professors lack today.
3,By far the best professor I have ever had. Truly inspiring.
5,One of the best professor I ever had in my student life. Great teaching strategy  very cooperative and great motivation. I recommend him to all my friends. BUT  you have to work hard
5,Eli is a wonderful teacher. Keeps you thinking. Highly recomended. He's not an easy grade  but he'll help you get there. A must take!
5,He opened my mind and then stretched it. Now I am a different person. Prof. Amdur is a wonderful teacher and mentor.

3,good professor
5,amazing professor! your really dumb if you can't get atleast a B in her Class. overall easy A. she will help you with everything. you have to go to class if you dont want to do much work because she gives you everything you need to know in class. TAKE HER!!
5,Great professor with a great amount of patients and a very fair grader. Hw every 2 weeks if you need stats as a cj requirement try 2 take it with her she really works with you
5,very nice and easy. no homework whatsoever and only one project/paper. highly recommended
4,She's very good. Her approach to learning is quite different  but it's a refreshing change. If you allow yourself  you will learn so much more than what you think you can. Highly recommended.
5,Stats such but she makes it good. If you have to take stats  take it with her. She makes a hard topic easier..At least she cares and tries to help you..She's great
5,She is the best ever  she is a true guru of statistics. She has great advice and is very pleasent in sharing her knowledge. Take if you are up for a challenge  her classes will make you a better person.

5,I've had Camilo throughout my two years at Dutchess and its simple. Go to class  listen in lecture  take the critique and you wont have a problem. Although you may feel that you're not learning anything in lecture  pay attention because it all will pay off.
5,Camilo is one of the best professors  but he makes you work really hard. His classes tend to be demanding and time consuming outsidemail of the classroom. You will eat sleep and breatheven your work. And it can always be better.
3,He means well but the way he talks can be hard to understand. Also his theory is to say how much you suck ass with filming and then hopefully that motivates you to do better. I have to say it worked for me
5,He is honestly the best professor I have ever had at Dutchess. I've been going to Dutchess for two years and out of all he professors I have ever had he is my favorite. He has a very thick accent  but he makes fun of it himself so it is all out of fun. He truly cares about your education and he wants you to do well. Absolutely amazing.
5,Camilo is the man. If you're serious about learning all things film this is the man to learn from. He will be tough on you and he's very straightforward but it is for your own good. If you don't enjoy and take something from his classes then you are in the wrong field.
5,Camillo is easily the greatest communication teacher of all time period. He will be hard on you but it's for your own good. If you can't take Camillo  change your major because it gets no better than this.
5,He is a great teacher. He tells you how it is(meaning if your work is crap he will let you know)  if you can't handle it you're in the wrong major. Camilo is funny. Great helper. Take notes and you are fine. He is very inspirational. He does have a accent but you can understand him. DO NOT SHOW UP LATE TO HIS CLASS! Do not miss any days either.
2.5,Camilo was a great teacher. I enjoyed his class a lot. It was just a lecture but I learned a lot. His accent is thick but if you try you can understand him. He even sat down with me and outlined my entire class course for the rest of my Dutchess career. Just show up to class and do the work  you'll pass. If you ask for help its there Funny guy too
2.5,He's an ok teacher. Not the best if you're looking for order and methods. He tends to freestyle and work different projects year round. He's an all around good person and a really tough grader. His group projects is what brought me down. Took a different class and have nearly aced it. Group projects BEWARE!
4.5,This guy is amazing. He has a thick accent yes  but if you come to class and show that you truly care you are fine. I absolutely love him. I hate that we have to use Avid as the main editing software but he will help you. All you need to do is go to him. He is so inspirational. Cant wait to take his AP class.
3.5,Camilo can be hard to understand with his accent and some of his assignments aren't very clear cut. The class can be tough at times  and he's a stickler for doing things his way. However i think he's an amazing person. The class might've been hard but I'm glad I took it with him
4.5,Camilo is literally by far the best professor I have ever had at Dutchess. He's everything you'd want in a professor if you are interested in the subject and willing to work hard every day. He is hilarious  witty  and always willing to help with whatever. He really strives for your absolute best and does not accept any BS.
2.5,I learned A LOT in his classes. Gets u to work hard  that's good. He's very passionate about the subject which can be good and bad in this case -good b/c u can learn as much as in a known film sch at the community coll level but also bad if u get too invested.Remember that it's still a community coll crse for credit for a degree w/value. Balance.
5,"I had him several years ago but what he says still haunts me to this day as I pursue a career in film: ""How bad to you want it?"""
1,he can barely even speak english  hes mad confusing and not helpful at all
3.5,You definitely need to be a self starter and very disciplined to be successful in his classes. He is very passionate about his class and making sure his students are the most successful in whatever their future endeavors are unlike any other teacher you will experience here at DCC. He's more about quality than quantity
4,Camilo is probably the best teacher I will ever have in my college career. Yes  he pushes you  yes the work is hard  but this industry is hard. The work Camilo made me prepared me for what the industry will expect me to do. He is helpful  easy to talk to  and funny. I will miss Camilo when I go onto my next school. Take his classes!
5,Wonderful professor. He expects you to work hard  and he works even harder trying to you to see the value in that. He's a Harvard experience in a Community College. Take his classes!
3,He's a great teacher  and some people don't realize why he says and does the thing he does until they've moved on from DCC. Take what he says and use it. I've moved on from DCC and it took me to go away to another school to realize how much harder I should've worked. He sets his students up for the future. You won't get that anywhere else. I swear
5,I left DCC last semester  moved on to a more acclaimed school  met new people  new professors  and Camilo is still the best Professor/person I have ever met. Simply put  I've got his back  because he has always had mine. Love that man! Take his class  or drop out.
5,Mrs. Benston was the best professor I've ever had (Undergrad and Grad school). I keep the journals she made us write (all 89 pages with notes) and once in a while will read through her comments. She is one of the most intelligent and caring individuals I've ever encountered. I think of her often now that I'm also a teacher.
4.5,Amazing!
4.5,By far  my favourite professor at all of Emory.
2,She's smart  as others have said  but she also let's you know that she thinks she's SOOO smart and SOOO much smarter thn you and evryone else. It becomes annoying and tiresome.
5,I don't know a smarter person on earth  period. And this woman is an exceptional professor  wonderful person  and funny as hell. It's true  this class will kick your ass  but in a good way. You'll be thankful for it after.
5,A cheerleader at the battle of Jericho  Alice is an institution  and AesCrit of theater (which WILL kick your ass) is one of the best classes I ever had. Great teacher.
4,This isn't one of those classes you can cruise through with minimal effort. Be ready to show up for class and to put in some real effort. The tests are tough  but you soon catch on to what she is looking for (lots of specifics!). I thought she was an interesting lecturer and used plenty of real-world examples to make the material relevant.
1,Her attitude shifts from one class to the next. She acts like she is only there to draw a paycheck. Her teaching is vague and dependent on her emotion. She can be very rude. Even if you try your hardest  she dismisses it. If possible  find a better instructor for Stats and Probability. Even with her credentials  I question her scientific capability
4.5,I am taking this class as a hybrid over the summer. DEFINATELY fast pace  but Mrs. Seagle is very accessable  and helpful. I was scared to death of stats  but thanks to her  I'm making A's. She is awesome...so the one's that dont like her  dont try  I suspect. She won't put in effort if you dont!
5,Before I took this course  I was scared to death of math  because it was a subject in which I had always performed poorly. Mrs. Seagle is helpful and kind  and explains the subject matter in a way that is practical and accessible. She expects students to show up and put in the work  but then again  if you do not  you'll never learn statistics.
1.5,Very sour and rude. She doesn't seem like she likes her job or the students very much. She gets easily frustrated  and seems to have a hard time explaining things in a way that other people can understand. It's like it's her way or the highway...
2,Very rude and has an unpredictable mood. One day she is happy  and the next she is not. She seems like she does not like her job very much. She told me to come and ask for help  but then asked me to leave her office and not to come to class that day.
5,Really awesome and interesting teacher  and I don't even like math.
5,Hilary is a great instructor with the ability to keep her students awake irrespective of the arguably dry nature of statistics. She provides real-world examples that form a connection and enhance learning and recall. She gets to the meat of the matter  without superfluous garbage that you will likely never see again. DO NOT BE AFRAID OF STATS!!!

5,The only math teacher I have had who took the time to explain things.
1,sour and not friendly to students. i dont think she likes her job very much.
1,Has no people skills whatsoever. She is rude and impolite. Acts as if she gets mad when someone doesn't understand  and asks for her to reapeat a step.
1,The worst math professor I've had in my life  does not know how to teach. Most of the time she cant even figure out her own math problem that she created and she just looks at the problem all puzzled trying to figure it out when some students solve it first. Most of the time the students will solve the problem first
5,If you don't understand  she will make sure to assist you after class. She asks if we all understand before moving to the next chapter and gives a few papers to review at home. She explains things very clearly.
1,Worst Professor Ever! Do NOT TAKE HER CLASS! I repeat do not take her class! Even if you are good in math do not take her class.
1,If you want to pass math  under no circumstances take the course with this professor.
1,Don't take her unless you want to fail the class. She is not a good math professor at all. I wouldn't even give her 1 point but the website doesn't allow me to give her 0 point. DON'T TAKE HER.
1,Don't take her unless you are a math genies or lover. She barely knows what she's doing  she can't teach. She does the same example that's already on the book   when you ask for help she laugh and spend half of the class time making everybody guess the answer. She only does one example and then blame everything on the department. Tests are TOUGH .
1,She is the worst as a professor! I got a B and that's for fail just 1 test cause I was late that day  I got A in all the other test.... She confused the students all the time  and never ask cause she laughs. Btw.. She always give study test that are exactly like the test  sometimes test were even easier. Honestly I pass this class cause my boyf.
1.5,"She's nice but her way of teaching is blah. Everything she does is by the math department. Her answer to everything is literally ""It's on the syllabus."" If you want to pass and actually understand take another professor."
1,The worst professor I've ever had.... She can be a teacher! She don't know how explain anything... My advice choose another professor!!!
1.5,She is very nice  and likable as a person but her teaching style is very difficult to follow along & speaks very fast. With us she has to go by the departmental syllabus. She only shows us a few problems & its hard to ask questions. Tests have nothing to do with class work or MyMathLab. Also i think the Mastery worksheets are given too much.
5,She's a good proffesor if your interested. Her test are difficult but she's just preparing you for what you have to take next.
1,She sucks at teaching math. If your not good at math don't choose her. She's not helpful at all and she doesn't explain anything well. She goes way to fast. She doesn't seem to be interested in helping students excel. She's the WORST!! Beware don't choose her please
1,She only does the easy problems on the board & when u get the worksheet u don't know what to do. The test r harder than anything she teaches. She closes her eyes when she lectures and has an attitude sometimes. She's also very impersonal. Don't take her class 'cause u will fail. She makes her assistant wait outside till the end of class like a dog.
1,Professor Green is one of the worst mathematics professors I have ever had. She is almost always tardy to her own class but will reprimand those students who come in after her  even when she is 15 minutes late. Ask her for help or clarification and she will laugh at you. Claims exams come from the department so you can't blame her for failing. BAD!
1,Don't take her !!!!
1,Worst teacher ever. i swear every time I walked into that class my IQ dropped. The teacher is late all the time except when there' a test being given. Complicates the lesson DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO TEACH. And don't bother asking questions. she just laughs and makes you keep guessing before telling you the answer and wastes half the class time doing so
1,"She is the worst college professor I have ever took because she is not helpful at all and dosen't encourage students to pass the class including me  of course. That is why I failed this class. Also  she doesn't give extra credit and pre-test reviews. In fact  she is more like Hal 9000 from ""2001 : A Space Odyssey"" than a professor."
1.5,I am currently taking her class and she does rush through the material. She is late sometimes. The tests are graded strictly. She doesn't review before tests because students do not feel they can ask questions. My advice is to seek tutoring. However you can take the departmental exam to opt out repeating which is what I might due.
1,She is the worst professor that I took because she is not helpful at all.
2.5,Ok  it's not that she laughs at you  is her way even when you are right she laughs  but if you are not good at math don't take her  she expects you to know what you are suppose to know  no extra nothing  what you got is what you are going to get  she won't help you with extra points  she does not encourages you. She's nice but tough NOT EASY CLASS
1,Doesn't teach well. Avoid.
3,Dr. Dogru was a good professor in my opinion. She gave very tough tests  but was always fair. The class consists mostly of her handing out packets of the material and were expected to work on it with a group. She walks around and if you got stuck  she could explain it many different ways. She is a very smart woman and rather challenging.
4,Dr. Dogru always had well planned out packets to give us. However  we basically had to learn the material in groups before she would teach us how to do it. She was very sweet and was always available for office hours. She didn't put homework grades in until the end so I thought I was getting a C when I really ended up with an A-.
1,Literally the worst professor at Grand Valley. If you like actually learning calc  don't take her.
2,Very unclear when teaching and explaining  not very good at explaining things in a different way  test are super hard and she puts problems way harder and more complex than anything we do in class or have had as homework. Only goes over homework about half the time
1,"She is easily the worst professor I've ever had and I am a junior. She has people essentially teach themselves every lesson or she teaches a lesson then ""gets tired"" and stops. Zero feedback on any graded item. Forces you to use WebWork  a completely outdated program that is horrible in every way. Lazy  poorly put together  and generally terrible."
1,She doesn't explain things very well. Laughs when someone has a wrong answer or doesn't do their homework. Exams are nothing like we've done in class or for homework. Difficult to study for. Better off using online videos to teach yourself. Only goes over easy examples in class and gives hard questions on the exams.
5,Take her! She gives a few concept notes and examples on the board. Point out a mistake and she is cool about it. Mostly work on handouts with people you sit with while she walks around and helps. Her teaching style is to let you figure things out while she guides you. Few graded homeworks. She has a Turkish accent  but is very understandable.
4.5,Dr. Dogru was extremely helpful all semester long. At first  I thought her accent was going to be difficult to understand  but I quickly adapted. She is one of my favorite teachers. It is fairly easy to do well in her class as long as you pay attention. There isnt much homework  and the tests are straight forward.
2,Because she isn't a native English speaker  she can be confusing when she is lecturing
3.5,I really liked Prof. Dogru and enjoyed her class. Her quizzes were not too hard and as long as you payed attention  did your homework  and tried you would do well! When you don't understand something  just ask! She is always willing to change her ways and explain in a way that may make more sense to her students.
4.5,She was extremely helpful. She is the best professor  I have ever had. Even though Dr. Dogru didn't teach in a style I was used to  she tried very hard to help her students understand the material (not just how to solve the problems). I would definitely recommend her.
1.5,How Dr. Dogru taught was very frustrating. She was hard to understand at times due to her accent and her somewhat poor English made newly explained concepts more confusing. Got a good grade but had to spend a lot of time figuring out concepts on my own. She marks things wrong but doesnt explain why. Extremely nice lady  not a good 227 professor.
4.5,Professor Dogru is extremely nice. Very approachable and always willing to explain concepts until everyone understands. Easy to listen to for those 2 hour courses  and gives a break if you need it. I would DEFINITELY RECOMMEND Professor Dogru to any student taking MTH 202. She made retaking 202 a breeze.
1.5,It was apparently her first time teaching MTH 227  and she didn't do a very good job of it (bad at explaining). I highly suggest registering for a different professor for this class. There are a lot of homework checks  and it doesn't really matter if you did it right or not as long as you attempted (not helpful for learning the material at all).
1.5,Ugh. I didn't like her. She was confusing and her tests had stuff that she had only brushed over and never explained how to find  only said that it existed. She was a nice person  but even asking her questions in office hours was confusing.
4.5,Professor Dogru is a great professor. She is foreign so she has a very slight accent and occasionally she will accidentally mess up some grammar while talking but she is extremely helpful and truly cares about her students
4,I really enjoyed having this professor. You had to work to earn your grade but her exams and quizzes were reasonable if you studied and knew your material. You had homework but not very much and didn't take very long to do. Sometimes she is a bit hard to understand but will clarify if you just ask. I would recommend this professor.
4.5,She was one of my favorite professors (even surprised our class with pizza!). She is so sweet  caring  and enthusiastic to teach. She is very helpful when you ask questions. The class isn't extremely difficult but not easy. Her tests are a little tough  but if you study and do all of the homework you'll be fine.
5,She is an EXCELLENT! teacher. She makes all students prove and present proofs. Some students hate that. However  she is very helpful. Most of us having fun and learning well. Her exam questions are hard. I took the class in spring 12  it was fun. I recommend her.
4.5,I just finish taking her class in Summer B (six weeks course) her class was heaven easy. I got B. I thought she was going to be harder but really she wasn't.
3,shes ok but very sarcastic and never smiles she gives lots of works and never helps you. she stressed you out.
1,I hope it is the teacher im talking about. She is a college prep teacher and I hope she reads this  I DIDNT LEARN ONE THING IN YOUR CLASS. you are way too repetitive and you care too much about attendance in the first place. Her teaching skills are HORRIBLE! Half the time she doesnt even know what shes talking about. conclusion. HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!
5,I really enjoyed her class. It was a lot of work  yet it was helpful. She is always available for extra help and walks you through all her assignments. I got an A in her class because I worked and payed a lot of attention.
3.5,She asks for too much. The whole class complained about her everyday. She is nice but answers very sarcastically when you ask her a question. I wouldn't recommend her unless you want to stress.

3,I loved Professor Arminio! Although he is tough  it's because he wants students to understand that college isn't supposed to be easy. But he is kind  funny  and when he lectures  he takes his time to make sure concepts are understood. He expects you to do a lot of studying on your own however. Would take again. So sad that he is retiring. :(
5,Super good professor! I really loved what he taught and how passionate he was about it. He's retired now  but I'm leaving a review out of pure gratitude. He rocks!
3.5,Arminio is a competent  if not charismatic  professor. He's old school  bone-dry  and clear-cut in his teaching style
3,He tells you what you general things for tests and gives handouts. Pop quizzes are on vocab that you have to define from the book  and aren't really random  he tells you the class before to study. He offers help. When it comes to tests  study everything and know little details especially for short response questions. Tough grader  NO extra credit.
5,Awsome teacher  he prepares you very well before you take the exams. Everything that he teaches you will be on the test. Willing to help if you need it. Funny and loves to joke around.
3,Read your book and teach yourself. He's a great teacher and he explains the material clearly... after you've already taken the test. The only test that actually reviews material you've already covered in class is the final. by then it's too late. 8 people out of 30 stayed in his course til the end. I'm sure i'm not the only one who failed.
2,"Watched him kick a mentally handicapped man out of his class before he turned to the man's mom and said ""don't try to back me in a corner"". He's a disgusting man and the people who think he's funny don't know when they're being insulted. He loves to fail students  makes him feel powerful. he'll withdraw you for challenging him Plan to hate science."
5,He's so sweet  I had to study more than for my other classes but I do not regret it at all. Always be present for class  miss more than two classes and you're out- no joke. He will week out the weak ones so if you're looking for an easy professor look else where.
5,Honestly  my favorite professor at MDC. He's tough but he's also so sweet- don't let his biker exterior fool you.
5,As a person at MDC  he is the greatest. As a teacher  he is the toughest. He is very funny but his test are even funnier if you do not study. MUST put a lot of time into this class and attendance will cause you to fail if you are tardy or absent a lot. He will help you during office hours as well. Very lovable.
5,His tests are difficult because of the short responses  but he is a great and passionate teacher
4,He's the best professor ever!!! Loves to joke around  but he definitely makes you have an interest for science. Requires lots of studying  if you study you'll pass his class. If not you'll struggle.
4.5,Professor Arminio is awesome. He explains topics very well  has flexible office hours for extra help  announces exams well in advance  and loves to give pop quizzes. These quizzes aren't really pop though  as he always says to expect one soon. Arminio  also  gives great advice about future schools to apply to. Overall  he is THE best.
5,Best professor in MDC. I acquired an interest in science after taking this class... He gives vocab quizzes that you have get from the book and gives handouts to study for the test. If you study you will get an A. I did...
2.5,I took his 6 week course for earth science  definitely not an easy A. But he gives u chances to improve grade with quizzes. Book wasnt neccessary.
2.5,DONT TAKE IT HIMxe2x80xa6... FIU HAS A LOT PROFESSOR BETTER THAN HIM.I MOVED TO FIU AND I GOT A BIG A...
5,He is probably the best teacher at MDC. The class is not easy  you HAVE to study. But he will give you everything you need in order to pass the test. He is really nice and funny. I highly recommend taking him for oceanography. GREAT PROFESSOR GREAT CLASS!
5,He is by far my favorite teacher at MDC. His class is NOT easy. If you want an easy A do not take. But if you want a fair teacher who really knows about the subject or if you love oceanography take this class. He is a very nice person and is writing me a letter of recommendation. Got an A because I did all the work and studied.
2,If you're very into learning oceanography  TAKE HIM! He gives vocab quizzes and his test are from the handouts and stuff he writes on the board. This class is NOT EASY but if this is your major  then I suggest to take him. He doesn't give extra credits. Use the book for the vocab. He will not inform you regularly about how your doing in the class.
5,Best Professor to have  he's fun but when it comes to doing work he takes it very serious. the class is very easy made me change my study habits for the best. plus he prints the notes for the class and hand them out which all the test come from.
5,professor stewart tells you up front what the deal is and you sign a contract and stick to it. no cell phones  no sleeping but its all in the contract and she will give you a chance to drop the course.first test for mid-term is 5 questions and the final is 10 questions and she give you extra credit. you cant fail this class unless u fill the blank
5,i had her last semester & this has got to be the best course i've taken during college yet! she's strict (no food  NO PHONES  & attendance is a must!)  but she's also very cool and funny. there are only two exams during the entire semester  & the only work she assigns is optional/extra credit to boost your grade. this class IMPOSSIBLE to fail!!
5,She is the best teacher everr! Super easy class if you cant pass this class just give up on life! All you do is watch videos all day and on mondays we tak notes which is just vocab. words. PEOPLE  it doesnt get easier then this.
5,Great humanities professor! Her specialty is teaching dance but she does great in all arts apparently. Strict but funny. Take her  you'll enjoy it.
5,"Easy ""A"" my favorite class at Miami Dade. She's has a lot of rules and strict on attendance but besides that she cares about her student  good at her profession  and gives snacks. I can guarantee you  you will love and enjoy this class....."
5,Easiest class therefore she is very strict! U will be handed a contract  listing multiple things u CANNOT do--other work  chewing gum  eating  have the phone on silent/vibrating  excessive absences  etc. This is no idle threat  I've seen her drop people TWICE for these infractions. Other than that u are golden. Less than A  college is not for U!
5,The best in the world. Easy A++++
5,EASIEST CLASS IN THE WORLD  GREAT FOR GPA BOOSTING... JUST BE PREPARED FOR SEEING T & A EVERYDAY ALL DAY... ALSO RECOMMEND HER HUMANITIES AND DAN2100 CLASS
5,Very nice  funny and helpful teacher. Loves what she's teaching and although its an easy A class you do learn. Test are mix and matching and she reviews exactly what's on the test. Awesome teacher  I'd recommend her anytime and to anybody. You won't regret taking her! TAKE HER!
4.5,a very easy class. homework due only once a week  and the tests are simple as well.
5,Super nice! Class is boring if you dont like dance. But she is a great teacher. dont be absent on mondays! tests are mix and match. great class to learn about dance & get your gpa.. take for humanities A & B!
5,Very easy class. You watch dance films throughout the semester. Her tests are mix and match. She reviews before the test. Don't miss too many classes and definitely don't miss the day of the review. Easy A  lots of extra credit if you get less than an A in her class  than you have issues. Take her for the new class(Exotic dance-Stripping)in Fall.
5,Very good professor! She is very nice and has a lot of interesting information to share! :D
4,shes super nice and her class is easy. i definitely recommend her.
5,EXTREMELY EASY A ONLY A DUMMY CAN FAIL HER CLASS. SHE TELLS YOU EXACTLY WHAT YOU WILL HAVE FOR MIDTERM AND FINAL I HIGHLY RECOMMEND HER. I GOT AN A ON HER CLASS. DONT MISS HER CLASS SHE LITERALLY SIGNS YOU OUT AT THE END OF THE CLASS. SHE WILL LOWER YOUR GRADE AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ABSENCES OR TARDEES. SHE GIVES LOTS OF EXTRA CREDIT. TAKE HER.
5,She is an outstanding instructor. She is always organized. She makes the class interesting.
5,EASY SHE IS VERY HELPFUL AND YOU CAN LEARN A LOT FROM HER I RECOMMEND YOU TAKE HER!!!!!
5,Awesome teacher I took her for dance class. She is strict in her attendance policy and in other things but u only take 2 test that Match and she gives a lot of extra credit opport. all you do is watch videos.I really recommend her class it was an easy A
5,Great teacher..Outlines due mondays..20 question midterm plus extra credit. 25 question final plus extra credit and..1 presentation..EASY!!
5,She is great it is best to take during the summer 6 weeks section and she only uses 4 weeks
3,Pretty condescending towards non-native English speakers. His essay corrections are often very unclear and difficult to learn from. Claims to be a generous grader but in reality is harsher  more nit-picky  and less forgiving grader. To be fair  he always offers private office hours to those who need it. I unfortunately did not benefit much frm thos
4.5,He is so funny! Great sense of humor  gives interesting assignments  and is really easy to talk to. Take him if you want to be a tutor in the HUB!
5,One of my favorite English classes ever. Zorn is very helpful and a brilliant instructor. He has some great stories to tell and you can learn a lot from him. He's open to different writing styles so long as your work reads well. If you put some thought into each paper and pay attention to the discussions  you'll do well.
4.5,Zorn is such an intriguing and intelligent guy  but the man is a little crazy! High standards on the 3 essays (basis for your entire grade..)  but his dedication to helping your writing progress is just unmatched. Difficult grader  but really engaging discussion. Overall an incredibly helpful character who is amazing at what he does!
3,i really liked Zorn and found him funny. he talks a lot about how he used to teach at a black college or high black population college or something. i was very surprised to find that my grades on his papers  which were getting increasingly better  while i mocked conservative rhetoric and style  went bad as soon as i challenged NEOcon thinking.
5,Caring  personable  very distinct teaching style--invites students to participate  helps freshman muddle their way through college writing. Often shares interesting personal anecdotes with the class. Wide range of teaching experience evident. One of my favorite professors!
4.5,Zorn is one of my favorites! Wacky in all the right ways that makes coming to class worth your while. The reading is manageable  but the papers can be challenging and he grades pretty hard (all in the name to make you a better writer). But Zorn's always there for help. I learned a lot in his classes  and that is money well spent here at SCU.
4,3 papers  peer editing before final turn in every time. Daily  manageable readings. Group discussions based on the readings. Participation is important. Funny  caring  and intelligent. Zorn is AWESOME!
4,Very entertaining prof. He is willing to help. Very nice and laid back  however he has no grading rubric and is not easy. But it was a relaxing class with not much reading and only 3 papers.
4.5,he is a nice guy and his class is pretty fun. he is a really tough grader though. if you can  take a different teacher for english. i had Professor King for english 2 and did much better than I did in english 1 with zorn
3.5,Professor Zorn is awesome! Super hippy and laid back.. He tends to talk a lot but he's a funny guy.there are only 3 assignments for the whole quarter and there pretty easy. He's just a tough grader but his main motive is to prove that you improved. I definately reccomend taking him for an easy laid back class. Plus he cancels classes all the time.
4.5,Jeffrey Zorn is an amazing ex-hippie  Grateful Dead-following  blustering professor. He is  for the most part  an incredible teacher  but the one problem is his quizzes. He is incredibly exacting and it is difficult to receive full credit unless you are able to predict exactly what he wants to hear from you. Class is always interesting  though.
2,"One of those professors who will either love or despise you. If he loves you (i.e. if you tolerate his odd mannerisms + laugh at his jokes to feed his ego) you coast. If not he will ""jokingly"" single you out in class and start arguments with you that end with you looking like a fool. Considers himself brilliant + constantly references his own work."
3,No Comments
4,Very very hard grader- you MUST keep up on all of the readings. But he gives excellent lectures and is very willing to help students with the assignments. Very funny- keeps you interested. I'd recommend him despite the really hard work.
4,He is the man. A little unfocused at times  but a great sports fan  and he will help you any way he can. He gave me a graduation present  now that is awesome. Plus he shows himself dancing at the end of the quarter.
5,best teacher and a great friend still today. quite an ex-hippy which is fine with me!!!! i love Dr. Zorn...
2,acts friendly saying things like quizes will be a breeze  but really he is incredibly picky. A right answer has to be exactly what he is looking for  which is usually very precise. I had him edit my essay  did his corrections + more and still wasnt an A
5,Funny guy. Open about how hard writing is. Tells good stories and makes great analogies. He's pretty tough.
5,Absolutely hilarious. Pretty hard material  but he gets you through it.
3,It's a history teacher. Lectures the whole time. No study guide for midterm or final. But it is all from notes and entails chose 4/6 definitions for short answer and then an essay (final has 2  1 is comprehensive). It wasn't too bad.
3,Don't expect to get a study guide for the midterm or final. Final is worth 40% of your grade.
3.5,Madden is a funny guy and I found his class somewhat interesting/entertaining. The tests were moderate and the only other assignments were to read 3 novels throughout the semester and do a book analysis on each which weren't hard. My TA was good too. Attendance not required.
3,Madden: GREAT teacher....his TA's: SUCK!!! i loved Madden's lectures  he was very interesting and even somewhat entertaining  however I HATED my TA. be careful of those guys. They control your grade...steer clear of Naus
2.5,Good Teacher  somewhat interesting lectures. Steer clear of James Naus for a TA in Madden's class he is a horrible grader and will make Madden's teaching totally worthless.
2.5,If you have a dispute with your TA over a grade Madden will regrade it  and the grade he gives you is your permanent grade. According to his secretary  he grades harder than the TA's do. Therefore  he is not willing to consult you with such problems. The TA's this semester were terrible.
5,Very good lecture class. makes history very interesting. throws in a few jokes.
5,A very good teacher  humorous too. He is very knowledgable about the subject and easy to listen to.Your grade depends on your TA and also how much information you retain from the lectures. Tests are essays and ID's. and not very difficult.
5,Madden is a great teacher and funny too
5,very clear very nice teacher. just be careful with TA's because they grade the whole class.
1.5,boring class. worthless assignments. the ta's this semester were truly awful. they were total jerks. one said he wouldn't care if your mother died and would still make you take the mid-term or turn in your paper. ridiculous. there should be a little compassion in this world.
3.5,Madden is a good lecturer  but not even he can keep me awake in class. This class basically depends on your TA. You can easily get screwed over on that. You'll be reading about 3 novels  and have a midterm and final. You'll have to study so watch out if you're lazy.
3.5,Very good teacher. Makes lecture more interesting and has a good sense of humor. Not too hard with only 3 short papers  a midterm  and final. Highly recommend him because he makes material more intresting.
4.5,I love this guy's lectures. He's really cool.
3.5,Don't take James Naus as your TA  he sucks. Contrary to popular believe  his lectures are boring. You don't have to go to class. Just reading for the most part. Garaunteed B
5,He is a very nice guy  and he makes lectures interesting with video clips and jokes. Only a midterm and a final..unless you get an awful TA you should be fine in this class. He posts all the lecture notes online in case you miss a class
5,Take his class if it fits your schedule!! He knows his stuff and has a great dry sense of humor.
4,Presents material clearly and adds witty remarks appropriately. Would def. recommend.
4.5,Really good teacher  tests aren't that hard  just a lot of material to go over. Pretty funny guy.
5,His lectures are wonderful!

5,Ms Pennington  now Weems  was very helpful and smart. I have always struggled with math  and I took her Stats over the summer  and got a 97. She is really nice and tries to help you in as many ways as possible. We didnt use the book but she used MathXL which greatly affects your grade. I loved her class. Always hated and sucked at math until her.
4,Great teacher! As long as you pay attention and do your homework you'll do good in this class. Pennington is a wonderful teacher and highly recommended! One of my favorites at gmc.
5,This is the BEST teacher for math ever! She really helps you understand how to use the TI-86 Graphing calculator and doe problems in class step by step..
4,One of the best teachers at GMC. She will do anything to help you succeed in life. She's my favorite professor.

5,Very helpful. Will do her best to help you succeed. Best math teacher ever!!

5,Gives you multiple chances to succeed.
5,She is nice and helpful.She does require some work and thinking but nothing too hard.She will make things as best she can and will change decisions each quarter with each individual class so be very nice and active and it will be easier.

5,"By the end of the semester  everyone loved her. Dr. Long is a great teacher. She loves her field  and she loves teaching those who also care about it. Just be respectful and you'll do fine. Also  never forget the space in ""a lot."""
4.5,I honestly loved this class. If you're interested in learning english  I recommend her. If your taking it just to get it over with  I still recommend her because she is there to help you if you need it and the work is more than manageable.
5,Dr. Long is such a sweet lady. She is extremely helpful and full of energy. A lot of people ended up dropping her class because they had poor grade  but it was only because they hardly showed up for class.
1,This class was TERRIBLE!!! She doesn't explain anything. She would be a great politician because every time anyone asks a question about what to do the answer has nothing to do with the question asked. Dont take her for any class!! not even underwater basket weaving!!
5,donna rox
5,Dr. Long is an amazing scholar and poet. Her classes are stimulating  but she won't hold your hand through them. If YOU don't show up for class or turn in your assignments  you probably won't be nannied  but you will fail the course. If you're self-motivated  responsible  and ready for mind-expanding feminism  sign up with Dr. Long.
1,OMG how can anyone say they liked this teacher? i went to her class everyday  did the work  went to the meetings about my 15 page paper and still got a C in her class...shes a Bia
5,Dr. Long is hard and she has no tolerance for fools at all. But if your willing to work  you can learn a lot from her. She actually made me a better writer  which is something 12 years of public school and 3 previous english professors failed to do. She's also kinda sexy  especially when she smiles after making a off-color joke.
1,she sucked.....really bad....i didnt get any Fing help from her at all...
5,I love Dr. Long!
5,I gave you a hot pepper  too. I don't know why it didn't show up on here...here  have another.
5,Dr. Long is the best English teacher I have ever had! I look forward to taking more of her classes. There is a lot of work involved with the course  however  if you show an effort and work hard  there is no reason you shouldn't get a good grade! Highly recommended for anyone who is serious about working hard and enjoying their English class.
5,Dr. Long is one of the most engaging professors at Fairmont State. She always has a smile on her face and knows how to enjoy a laugh. But on the serious side  I honestly believe that she should be in the public school system to catch some people before they slip through the cracks or before they get to college. I can't think of a better role model.
5,She loves the subject and that passion filters through into the students and makes them care about english and writing and has them want to learn English in this new light.
5,We thought you needed a hot pepper.
5,She is an amazing teacher  always keeps your attention. There's quite a bit of work involved but it's worth it. She's fair  laidback and worth having as a teacher. A+++++++++ to Donna Long
4,I revised  revised  and revised. It must have worked because I got an A.
5,Yes  Dr. Long does give you a lot of homework  but it's worth sticking with. I enjoyed this class a whole lot  and am glad I took her. She definitely knows her stuff  and her enthusiasm shows through. Highly recommended.
5,I love this class. I'm there everyday  hungover or not. She keeps you interested in writing. If I have a question  she has an answer. She does tear apart your papers but it's well worth it becuase you will become a better writer.

5,Hade a fun day with Kerry at my house and hope to hang out with him again
5,He is the best person to teach this course!!!!! I hope he will be teaching again very soon.
5,He was the BEST teacher I have ever had. If FSU lets him go it will be one of the biggest mistakes they ever make. If you have taken his class and you don't LOVE him somethings worng!
5,Great teacher  wouldnt have want to take this class with anyone else.
5,u do SOOOO rock LOVE u!!
5,HEY coach!!!! u rock i love you and u put a smile on my face every day that i see u!!!!
5,He is the most helpful teacher that FSU had or has. I enjoyed that class more than any other.
5,Coach respects everyone's opinion. He encourages everyone to share their feelings. Love this class. I'll miss him.
5,THis strong woman thinks he's the very best!!!!

5,Coach is a great guy. Easy class and very interesting. Your opinion matters and no tests or finals just a paper once a week
5,I love Coach!!!!!
5,I enjoyed going to this class every week. He really makes you think and everyones opinion matters.
5,he really makes you think. i loved the class! you have to speak up and participate and do your journals and its an automatic A+
5,Excellent! Participation is what makes the class great! The topics are very interesting  and it would not hurt if people made an attempt to open their eyes to more than a bias representation of the world! This class will open your eyes. As for complaints about writing the papers
5,very cool and fair. makes conversation good and makes sure we all get fed at class
4,Take his class  it will open your eyes to so many events. It is very easy you just have to write a 5page paper every week on your opinions of different topics. Very fun.
5,He made me feel comfortable to speak in class  and I felt that my opinions mattered....he is an awsome teacher!
5,Amazing lecturer and fair grader! Absolutely love her!
4,Great lecturer and overall great professor. She knows her materials and explains the process of nursing rather than reading straight from the powerpoint. However like any other nursing classes be ready to read the text. There's only so much time to cover all the materials
4,Really wen into this class thinking it was going to be nightmare. She is stern and can be intimidating at times but she is fair. Tests are right from lecture and textbook. Study and there would be no reason you will fail. There were multiple curves given to offset the questions that many students got wrong. Overall great lecturer and fair teacher.
2.5,Unprofessional. Talks down to students. Not helpful. Rude. Lecture material is NOT a good reflection of what will be on the exams. Students and clinical patients complained about her attitude  demeanor  and overall lack of professionalism.
3.5,Dr. Fresolla is a great lecturer  makes you connect the dots  is she tough  yeah but not horrible. Test #3 is CHALLENGE but it is a wake up call and makes you realize that this is Nursing and one CANNOT compartmentalize one's knowledge! However this is the test that will eliminate many  be prepared for it and respect it! She is Nursing boot camp!
4,Dr Fressola was tough but a great clinical instructor. She didn't make it easy but she respected that we were students and would tell us if we were making mistakes. She was very good about being professional when telling you about mistakes. She always had you step off the floor for comments. I learned a lot from her and I am very thankful.
3,I'm surprised to see that people had a positive experience with Dr. Fressola. She is disrespectful and condescending towards students. As someone whose original background is in teaching  her behavior is appalling. My dislike for her and her contempt for us did  however  motivate me to refuse to ever fail her exam. I passed out of spite :)
5,Dr. Fressola is one of the best instructors at Bergen. She has high expectations for her students  but makes it clear what is expected. She is one of the few professors that truly lives up to her doctorate in education. One of the only instructors that has the guts to review the exam in front of the entire class. The exams are difficult but fair.
5,Dr. Fressola was absolutely awesome.If you were in her class you walked a straight line. At the same time  I saw the passion she had for teaching  and nursing as well. Today  12 years after my nursing ceremony at Bergen  I thank her for being who she is  and for believing in me. Thank you.Dr. Fressola. She was simply marvelous!
4,The best teacher the program has to offer. Yes she was tough  but she's the ONLY professor who genuinely wants you to understand what it takes to be a nurse. The rest could care less if you get it or not.
4,I had her for clinicals and class. I passed the course and her 3rd test. I did better in her part than in Prof Timme's section. Dr Fresso challenged me  she did her part and i did my part. I am proud i didnt fail test 3. I love her for the challenges of GIGU.
4.5,I don't know what is up with all these reviews...Honestly  she is wonderful - prefessional and knowledgeable. Didn't hear her belittling anyone  answered all the questions  test are absolutely doable. She has a terrific work ethic and taught me to think as a nurse - priceless - worth some of the stress
1,Dr. Fressola is a cold  vile human being who spews venom from her mouth on a regular basis. Not sure why BCC or any hospital continues to keep her on the payroll.She gets her rocks off of making students cry. You will not learn anything if you have her  except how to be afraid. Good luck.
2,Does not answer any questions she doesn't feel like answering. Shows disdain and contempt for students. Test 3 is crazy-stuff you probably won't know unless you're already a nurse. If you have her for clinicals  be prepared to cry.
2,School is for learning and she makes it a horrible experience. Yells at you  humilates you  and makes you feel unconfident for no reason. She said that she became a nurse for the money and it shows beacause she has no compassion at all. I left the school due to the way she treated me and the lack of professionalism she displayed. It was pure abuse
1.5,Had this Prof last fall. She is an excellent lecturer  however  evil in clinicals. Does not care about her students. Read every NCLEX book you can to study. Most people fail Test 3. Don't get upset over it. Just ace Test 1 or else you're operating on a deficit. Good luck!
3,Did not have her for clinicals. As an educator she often stresses points that will not be on exams. Her exam (#3) is very difficult  not the material but the wording of the questions and answers.DO A LOT OF NCLEX and you will be fine. Try not to take her clinical group (wednesdays).
2.5,For the first 2 weeks of class I wondered why I'd read so many negative comments about Fres. However  after that point she showed her true colors. She was frequently aggressive and argumentative when students asked questions. Rather than help in cliinical she demeaned everyone. Unprofessional all around. I got a B+  but give her an F+ for attitude
3,Very Tough emotionally and knowledge-wise. You MUST study. Find every nlcex book and read them all. Test three..absurd. Keep up your grades for the other tests and you will survive. Don't ask stupid questions.. don't show weakness
3,She is a bvery tough teacher. Test 3 is impossible. She talks down to students which makes learning the subject less enjoyable. Don't be late  she locks the door. I didn't have her for clinical but I heard it was pure hell. No reason at all for some of her actions.
5,After graduating  I found that his classes are the most useful in the real corporate world. He is very clear and interactive in his teaching methods (with classroom discussions and on-hands experience). His textbooks were actually used  compared to other professors who assign books and never review/test the material. Hes also nice and encouraging.
2.5,Very boring  liked to hear himself talk  took attendance  but assignments were easy and he was well organized.
2.5,Talks more than teaches
1.5,meh
2,Boring. Can't Teach. Hasn't mastered material.
1,some one should teach him the material before they let him teach it. also some one needs to teach him HOW to teach it.
3.5,Again it's ashame to see so many disgruntled students. In fact this is a good professor  misunderstood at times yes. If you take the class properly and open your mind up you'll learn a lot. He's rusty on the details of program usage  but that's what your textbook is for. Go to him with macro-environment (computer) questions and he'll teach a lot.
1.5,"omg. what can i say? horrible teacher. its bad enough that he doesn't know how to teach  but when he does teach... he's WRONG. also  what he calls ""cutting edge""  ""new""  and ""revolutionary"" has been around for um.. years. good job jkeating! keep wasting our precious money. *sigh* I was looking forward to an e-commerce class."
1,Does not teach/explain things well. terrible.
1,complete idiot  but an easy A
2,No Comments
1,No clue how to teach. Stay away. If you are in BT you are screwed.
2.5,omg  this guy has no clue what he is talking about  and is boring as hell.
1.5,She makes you buy several books that you donvt even use. She signs very english .
3.5,Teacher has a great attitude and is very helpful but many times is disorganized and assigns reading that you simply will not have time to do. You must go to her and ask specifically what will be on the test because if you do ALL the readings she assigns  you will literally have no other time for any other classes. Syllabus is sometimes a mess.
1.5,Most unorganized teacher I have ever had. She is a very sweet woman who will work with you depending on what you have going on in your life  but she assigns more homework than she can even grade. Thanksgiving break is next week and I have not gotten one grade back all year. All of the homework is tedious  and you basically teach yourself.
4.5,Best ASL Interpreting program in the region. She is a tough instructor  has high expectations for students and assignments prepare you for professional interpreting work. When/If you graduate from her program you will be a working interpreter if you so desire. This major is not for whiners you will work your butt off.
3,Very knowledgeable of the subject. If you're serious about interpreting  this is the best you'll find. A TON of homework  takes a lot of time. But worth it!
4.5,Very strict but outstanding knowledge. Great teacher
1.5,may be in the running for the hardest major at maryville. she makes it that way. be prepared to study A LOT. labs are tough. she will make you a better interpreter. she is no joke.
1.5,YES  she is tough and requires way more work than any other teacher I have ever known but I understand why she is doing it. It doesn't mean I'm not going to keep complaining about 2 hr tests squeezed into an hr 15 min class. She is disorganized and cluttered which adds to the confusion but if you learn how she is you will depend on yourself more!
1.5,Unorganized  unclear. Expects students to read materials and memorize things verbatim for a quiz. If enough people fail  she'll give extra credit opportunities to hide her bad teaching. Weekly assignments (times two) get to be a lot.

5,I have had Dr. Millikin for a lot of my classes. He is a wonderful lecturer adn a wonderful pofessor. He is a professor that makes you figure out the answer fo yourself. The person who wrote the bad review probably expected him to give them the answers and that is not going to happen.
5,Dr. Millikin is a great professor and I learned a great deal in his classes. He's also a nice guy if you have the opportunity to sit down and speak with him. If you have questions  just ask.
4.5,Dr. Millikin is a great professor. Usually the people that don't like him are there to be given a grade. He is very helpful if you just ask.

1,Dr. Millikin is a horrible lecturer. He has 4 favorite subjects that he talks about everyday and basically you are left to read the book yourself to know anything that might be on the test. He encourages people to ask questions  but when you do  he answers you like you are stupid for not knowing.

4,April is wonderful and is one of my favorite teachers. While some of her classes do require a good amount of work  she is generally very clear about what is expected and is extremely helpful. She makes most classes fun with her humor and positive attitude. I am sitting in on some of her classes even though i don't need to take them!
5,Great class! Thank You!
5,She's a great teacher and she's hilarious! I love her class.
4.5,April is one of the sweetest professors ever! She is awesome and wants you to understand! She makes very effort to ensure that you enjoy her classes!
4.5,Very good teacher  fun class to take.
4.5,April's GREAT. I had prior knowledge of ASL when I got here  but I think she'd be great even as a first-year teacher. She's very conversational  gives great tidbits of information about Deaf culture that would never be in a book  and she's always willing to slow down and explain more. FYI: the classes are all in ASL because April is Deaf.
5,She's so hilarious  you'll love her!
5,Thanks April !!
4.5,i did not want to take this class at all  but since all of the other language classes were full  i had to. i'm so glad i took this class b/c it's fun and april is an awesome professor!
5,She is very funny and easy to follow  even if you have never had ASL before.
4.5,She is a wonderful teacher and tells funny stories. She will do what she can to make sure you understand what she wants.
5,She is an awesome professor!! I love the woman to death!
4,April is an awesome teacher.

5,"Hysterical  very clear  will repeat fingerspelling as many times as needed for people to understand. just wish she enforced ""voice off"" a bit more."
4,April is a good teacher. Her being deaf forces us to better learn sign language so that we can ask her questions  know our assignments  and have any possibility of doing well on tests. The ASL Lab is boring though... but April is very helpful.
4.5,She is absolutely wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,I love Dr. Craig! She makes Ethics fun! However  the most help she has even given me is by being my mentor. She wrote an amazing rec letter for me for grad school and has helped and encouraged me to do my best. I can talk to her about anything and I learned this by traveling with her during j-term. She is very caring  funny  and kind.
5,I have to admit that I was not interested in Research Methods when I first was given the required courses for graduation. Dr. Craig was also my freshman seminar professor. She is an awesome individual with outstanding amounts of knowledge. She became my mentor and confidant as I progressed through college. She will always help when needed.
4.5,I absolutely love Dr. Craig. She is so awesome and a great lecturer.
5,Very nice  always able to talk  even if it doesn't concern academics.
1,Absolutely the worst professor I have ever had in my entire life. Would not help you even if you went to her office time and time again. I have never met anyone so rude in my life.
5,Awesome! Really gets into the course! Take her if at all possible!
1,THE WORST PROFFESSOR EVER !!!! I DONT UNDERSTAND HOW HE'S STILL A TEACHER IN MIAMI DADE COLLEGE. HE MAKES YOU BUY THE BOOK AND WE NEVER USE IT! HE DOESNT TELL YOU YOUR GRADE UNTIL THE LAST DAY OF THE SEMESTER. STAY AWAY
5,GREAT PROFESSOR. TAKE HIS TIME TO EXPLAIN THE COURSE. REALLY DOWN TO EARTH. WISH I COULD TAKE HIM AGAIN. PASS WITH AN A+.
4,You need the book for his class if you want to pass the test. He gives you the test on Angel & then you take the test once again in class. I would suggest make friends and split up the test by chapter amongst yourselfs to make it easier. You don't need to take notes  so don't even bother.
2,Tests are way too hard
3,Not great dont take him. Tests are way to hard
5,AMAZING PROFESSOR! I wish i can take him again for another class..
5,He is literally the best and most understanding teacher ever. He is too sweet and actually teaches. Gives plenty extra credit and tests reviews are SUPER HELPFUL. Wish i could take him for another class. TAKE HIM IF YOU CAN!
5,Awesome teacher I loved his class. I would love to take his class again.
5,he is the best college professor i have ever had!!! his classes are very interesting and he is very flexible and funny.
5,Great teacher cares about students gives extra credit to boost grade. review for every exam. take him easy A. he will not stress you.
5,Professor is very helpful  knows the material well and gives 4 take home tests and two projects. Amazing professor  worth the time and money!
5,Just took him for Spring and he was great! Very nice and easy going. Class is an easy A
5,AMAZING!!!! He's Awesome. Great Teacher. Knows Exactly What He's Talking About. Take Home Quizes and Test Are In Class Are Exactly The Same As Quizes. Attendance Is Mandatory But If Anything He
4.5,VERY NICE AND EASY.. I RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!
4,Very nice professor. Knows what he's talking about. Take home tests followed by in class quizzes which are based on the tests. Attendance is MANDATORY! Lectures were kinda boring though  they felt like it was the same thing over and over. Got a C in the class though due to not completing the Gordon Rule assignment but I would recommend him
4.5,He is a great mentor
5,This guy is awesome. Seriously if you don't get an A you're an idiot. I took him last summer when I was 15 years old...
5,This teacher is amazing!! he really kept me awake an taught me so much about life. If you like to debate you should take this class! i got a B only because i didn't study for the quizzes. Take home test an Final!! what more can a student ask for!!
4.5,very very very very  nice Instructor. take his class you wont regret.That the best professor I ever had.he's the # 1 at the north campus no one else.
5,Great Professor! Very helpful and understanding if you miss class  as long as you keep him informed. He's very laid back  his classes are easy to understand and he's extremely helpful at all times... If you need to take SYG2000 he's the professor you need to sign up to!!! Trust me  he's the best!
3,"She teaches really good  her exams were based off everything she teaches. I did not understand math and she made it so simple. My only issue is class attendance. I missed class once and was not able to make up her work even though I had an injury. Five points from an ""A"". SKIP CLASS YOU WON'T PASS. Also beware of group work."
4,Professor España is great! Im terrible in math and passed the class with decent grade. If you participate in class she gives extra points on the tests. 4 tests 1 cumulative test if you havent done good on the others. Easy class. Highly reccomend.
4,This was the easiest class ever ! she is the sweetest and she is soooooo nice.
5,This class is really easy does require access code for hw
5,Easy work attendance matter because pop quizzes can happen which are open notes and she's caring a real darling
4,Very nice  easy class.
5,In a history of math classes I've taken Ive never actually received A's of any of my test. She even gave us candy  DO the extra credit trust me it helps!
5,Best math professor I've ever had in my life! She's truly a gem. Nicest person ever  she actually cares about her students  gives extra credit.
3,Definitely not my favorite prof. Learned more/better on mathlab then in class  because Im not too good at math and her teaching style wasn't good to me. if your already good youll do well but if not make sure you teach and prepare yourself and study in groups. lots of homework online before test  4 tests and she gives lots of extra credit. STUDY!!!
4,This is the thing. Her class is so easy that it's boring. Also  if you are into meditating  this is your class (weird  I know). Lectures are on the internet
5,Professor Espana teaching methods were some of the best methods I received at MDC. Provide extra credit and want to pass students
5,I love her I wish she taught all maths coming from a non math liker but take advantage of extra credit and you should pass TAKE HER TAKE HER TAKE HER it's was 8 weeks and I passed with a B and homework saved my grade giving that you can go back and improver score
5,I really don't know where to begin about professor espana. WOW WOW WOW is all I can think of. This professors offers so much extra credit opportunities!!! Put your best effort in and you will pass. Trust me  this is coming from a student that almost didn't graduate high school because of math. Easy breezy beautiful miss espana.
4,She is awesome. She actually cares about her students. Her Exams are not hard and she offer so much extra credit its almost impossible to not pass. Easy A for sure TAKE HER
4,professor espana is a great person. she loves helping her students. if you pay attention in class and do the online homework you will definitely pass the class.
5,AMAZING. Very clear  easy work. 10/10 would recommend. Very nice  give A LOT of extra credit  take advantage! I would definitely choose her as my professor again. Tests are super easy and you have so much extra credit you'll always pass.
4,professor Lourdes is a great teacher she cares about you  gives test but very simple  tries to be funny and the homework is very simple and its online. i recommend any one to take her. you do not need the textbook but you do need the access code.
4,This is the best math professor I've ever had. I had to take this class because I failed mat1033 three times  that's how bad I was doing at math. Now I got an A on her class. She is clear  teaches step by step  gives lots of extra credit  and gives an online review before every test. Tests are exactly like those reviews. I would take her again.
4.5,Shes a great teacher  she takes some getting used too but she makes you work for the grade  she gives PLENTY of extra credit so take use of it. At first she seemed harsh but I came to see she is actually a really good professor.
5,Professor espana honestly tries to help everyone  she gives a lot of opportunities of extra credit and she cares about her students! Take her  it will be the best thing you've ever done. Honestly make sure you study she will help you but you must try.
5,"Inspirational professor and interesting course. He has a lot of experience working in the EHS field.  and he brings ""real work"" to lecture."
5,He is a great teacher. His teaching style if very different and he makes his classes very interesting. There is never a dull moment in the class. I thought the class was very helpful too.
5,An exceptional and accomplished professor that brings education to reality. Great job!!!!
4,Great professor. His classes made the topic very interesting even if it's not your trackTests are multiple-choice which I hate. I learned a lot and the professor is a good grader too. The only thing is that it may be a little bit challenging for foreign students because of his cultural references and New-York-centrism.
5,Great porofessor makes class interesting. And his grading system is great.
4.5,Great professor. Interesting class.
5,Professor very knowledgeable. Assignments complemented lectures. Makes environmental health and safety a interesting course to take.
5,He is great. Lectures very interesting and engaging. Lots of visual/real world examples. Loved his class.
5,He's very engaging and presents the material very clearly  however Caravanos isn't always explicit with his expectations on assignments  and is a slow grader. He really made everyone become more aware/passionate about the environment. However  you need to ask questions for clarification in terms of what he's looking for.
5,Great Professor very knowledgeable and he is always there for his students.
5,He's just a wild and crazy guy!
4,Prof Caravanos is very knowledgeable. His lectures are interesting and often relate to current topics.
5,Dr. Caravanos is a passionate and an effective lecturer. He makes sure that his students have a clear understanding of the subject and encourages them to partake in all discussions. Since taking this class  I have a deeper appreciation for environmental health and safety. I applaud Dr. Caravanos for his dedication to students and his profession.
5,Excellent teacher. Makes dry topics fun. Loved the class.
5,Great professor!! He'll keep you interested even if you're not excited about environmental stuff!
4.5,"Professor was had plenty of relevant professional experience to pull from  provided assignments that were effective ""advanced organizers"" and made good use of available technology. Also highly approachable and very helpful."
4.5,Prof. Caravanos teaches an engaging course  making the material fun and accessible.
5,Very lucid. Plenty of relevant experience. Very enjoyable courses (any of them).
5,Professor Allen is a very good teacher! I had a 2 hour class with him and he keeps it entertaining. He's an easy grader  he genuinely cares and will teach you how to do certain things before you do an assignment. I would take him again in a heartbeat if I can!
5,Amazing professor has a bit of OCD when it comes to papers and how he likes it done but a lot very easy very lenient and gives you opportunities to make up your assignments.
5,Great professor  his class is really easy to pass. His work and essay topics are essay. Make sure to turn in work on time and you'll pass. My favorite thing about Allen is how he grades  he is not a tough grader at all. I don't write so good and all my essays have been higher than a B. His classes aren't boring so time goes by fast!
5,Very good professor. Class is fun and grades very fairly.
5,Professor Allen is very inspirational  if you like to write you will like them. He makes class entretaining and is very caring.
4,Great professor. I would for sure take him again  I really enjoyed coming to class. Al l you have to do is come to class everyday on time and complete the assignments and you will pass. He is really fair and is willing to work with you to help you pass. But you must do your part.
3,"dropped the class after three classes  he was excepting everyone to be an English major im willing to work for my ""A"" but man the time."
1,Prof Allen is a nice professor however he expects everyone to be a writer  I didnt like the class at all  and he used to make jokes all the time that were not funny. If you are good at writing take him  if not look for someone else  its no time an easy A
5,Preston Allen was one of the most weirdest but funniest professors I ever had. He would make a few face expressions that would make a few students laugh. He is straight forward with the work during the semester and how he want things done. You'll have around 3-4 essays with feedback provided after each one. Overall  great professor and you'll learn
1,I did not like him at all. Tough grader
5,Don't take this class if it's to fulfill the requirement. Instead come to class with an open mind and make the most out of it. Don't miss class  DO the work  ask questions  and you'll be just fine. Really smart dude that actually knows what he's talking about.
5,He is a professor that actually makes you think  in a good way. His lectures are the ones that when you finish them  you want to tell your friends what was discussed. Strongly recommended.
5,Very interesting and FUN class. I learned so much from him. You will have to write a lot of research papers  but you will gain so much knowledge from each of them. He is very fair with grading. I would take his class again!
5,Professor Allen is an amazing individual! I would definitly take his class again! He made it fun to learn about all the boring things of english!! Be sure to purchase one of the books he wrote they are awesome!!
5,Charismatic man  do all of your work (essays and academic marks) and you will pass the class. You will not dread going to this class rather you will be excited to go.
5,i would take this professor again if i could. hes an amazing teacher and makes lectures very interesting and fun. you'll learn alot from his experiences and classwork. would definitely recommend. only 3 at home essays and 3 in class essays. he takes away the lowest grades from both. easy A and lots of fun
5,Amazing teacher overall  there's 6 required assignments throughout the semester. Three in class essays and three home research papers. Overall he was an outstanding teacher  would definitely recommend.
5,I really dislike ENC classes and the semester I took ENC1102 I took 5 classes in total. Crazy to say that my favorite class this semester out of the 5 has been the ENC1102 class and it has been 100% due to Preston Allen's awesome lectures. He makes literature fun and makes you interested in what he is teaching. This professor is amazing.
5,Hes really funny in a weird type of way if you take him you'll see. The work isn't all that difficult and he is really lenient with when you turn it in as long as you email him explaining why you couldn't on the due date. Definitely going to try to take him for 1102. Shows a lot of videos and you pretty much just write responses to them
4,This professor is really weird but in a good way. He tells very corny jokes but you can tell he loves what he is teaching. Grades a bit tough but he will allow you to redo something for a better grade. DOES NOT ASSIGN A TEN PAGE RESEARCH PAPER!!!!! I would definitely take him again  great professor and very interesting topics and assignments.
3.5,Took Steve multiple times during my masters. You get from him as much as you want. If you are on the lazy side-don't take him. If you want to be pushed and are open to new ideas-he's your guy.
1,Kept talking about his mother. I don't know what she's got to do with mixing slip  but there it is. He's more interested in landscaping than teaching. Some folks should just not have tenure.
4.5,My mytsagogue! Kemenyffy initiated me into the real world! Best teacher of my life!
4,"Take his class if at all possible! I feel that any artist who does not have a chance for the ""experience"" is really missing out. Too many teachers set creative boundries  and Steve does not know the meaning of creative boundries. He will give you more information than you can handle. If you complete the work and show that you have not held back...A"
1,I had him for Intermediate 2. DO NOT TAKE HIM. He is a waste of your time  he is paranoid that everyone is out to get him  and you learn nothing about ceramics in his class. At this stage in my course outline  I should be doing all firings myself. He has taken my work and fired it. I have no idea what he did or why he did it. DO NOT TAKE HIM.
4,Steve K. is easily the best teacher I have ever had in any subject. He cares about his students and what they learn. He is a genius when it comes to art. He is eager to share what he knows and gives projects to individual students based on their interests and skills. He is crazy  long-winded  arrogant  and crazy  but he loves what he does.
3.5,Mentally the best prof. I have ever had. He pushed my mind to new creative levels. Love him! If you open your mind to him you can only gain.
3,Ive taken Steve twice and am about to have him again for my third Advanced ceramics class  listen to me. If you are taking a ceramics 1 class with him do not expect to learn how to throw. Expect to learn about quantum physics and conspiracy theories relating to aliens. of course the other two wont teach you much  either. Steve is good though.
5,Steve is seriously one of a kind  even though it may take him 2 hours to tell one story  he is an amazing artist  and if you actually listen to him alot of times his crazy letures really make you open your eyes about alot of stuff! I will warn you if you procrastinate  dont take him  but its definitely a great experience. I'd take him again.
2,no one else compares
4,too many mushrooms
5,The raw energy comment below is dead on. Steve can be a little much for the unprepared  but Sitting In A Room Listening To Steve 101 should be required for everyone on campus. Not a ceramics major  but would def. take him againfor anything
3.5,Crazy genius/mad artist and former physics guy. Insanely talkative but perhaps the most knowledgable person about anything and everything  including ceramics of course
4,With out a doubt one of the most brilliant minds at the university. He is the heart of the Ceramics program at edinboro  without him the program will die. Although he talks too much he is mostlikely the most knowledgable ceramicist in the WORLD!
5,You will not learn haw to throw in this class do not listen when he says to glaze greenware you pieces wiil be ruined
2.5,I took him for a summer course  and found out that the man is indeed crazy. Will reach into kiln and grab pieces without gloves. Steve is like an encyclopedia though  he knows more than what he can say.

5,He's totally insane  but very bright. He's always willing to do whatever it takes to help his students.
3.5,He has a thought to offer..You just have to listen closely he talks fast!!!
3.5,I loved her. She is a little out there  but she repeats things sevral times with handouts that help when studying. The workload isn't too rough  but there is a lot on test. I had her for psyc 120 the sensation class. Spends more times on eyes than anything. But I recommend taking a class from her.
4,Very helpful and knowledgeable as she is a veteran of all topics related to sleep&dreaming  but the overall course was not what I expected - it was much harder than it appears. My final grade was a B-  but I devoted a lot of my time to this class and put in what I thought was more work than was expected of me. VERY challenging  but you do learn.
5,Dr. Kahan goes over everything at least twice. 6 quizzes (lowest score dropped) and optional final to replace your quiz grade. 5 lab reports. 1 research project that she gives you the entire quarter to do  but you can complete in 1 week. She tries to make the class seem intense  but it's very laid back. She drills APA format into all her students.
5,Dr. Kahan is a very nice  caring professor. She expects a lot  but there are no surprises. Go to class  pay attention  participate  read the assigned readings  and you'll do well.
5,She is a tough grader  but very fair  helpful and entertaining. She gives out written study guides  before each test  that divulge her exact game-plan
4,Dr. Kahan is an extremely intelligent  very caring professor. The class is difficult  but she is very clear about what she expects from you so if you do the work it isn't difficult to do well. Cognitive is probably the most interesting topic for this requirement  I would definitely recommend taking the class!
2.5,She is a good person  but I feel that she asks for too much as an undergrad who never plans on going to grad school for psyc. She always wants MORE. There is no way to avoid her. Put it this way  I would rather take Human Neuropsychology than take a class with her.
4,The readings aren't too tough or very long  that coupled with the fact that she reviews the readings in class  makes it easy to be prepared for her tests. The class was interesting content-wise and she just made it that much better. She's goofy and her dream journal assignment was fun. Her grading policy is simple but strict: do what she asks.
3,Dr. Kahan is different from most professors in the psych department  she makes you think. She expects most students to be able to integrate material  unfortunately most other psych courses dont train you for this with multiple choice tests.
1,Uses same material for Perception & Cognition Classes. Completely full of it.
4.5,No Comments
3.5,"Great person  I recommend her as an advisor. She was always willing to help  but still vague. It was a very challenging course and I just think I don't ""get"" cognitive psych."
4,challenging course
5,Excellent teacher. Very engaging. Demands that you learn and contribute to the class. Had a lot of fun and learned a lot. Very personable and professional.
5,Professor Downs was by far my favorite professor in my four years at the University. He cares about his students  is a great mentor  and his passion for writing and journalism inspires his students. I took every class from him that he taught. If you get the chance  take one of his classes.
5,The sweetest  kindest professor I've ever had-- so helpful  considerate  and kind. Take his class. He's an amazing writer  and an understanding human. He'll visit you in the hospital when you try to kill yourself.
5,No Comments
5,This is by far one the best Math professors at MDC. I wish she taught every math class from MAT0020 thru 1105 including Statistics and Calculus. I used to hate math but she made it so easy and clear to understand. Study and care about the class and you'll be fine. She's simply the best!!!!!
5,Great teacher. NOT a push over by far. Do her HW  attend class  do her reviews  and you WILL do well. Rare teacher that cares about her students. relays information in a clear simplistic format. AWESOME TEACHER!
5,She is not a push over. U have to do her HW (She dont play that) but if u do its a recipe for success. Just attend class  do HW  ask ?'s  and do her reviews and you WILL do very well in her class. U will be spoiled by her ability easily relay the information because once you leave her class u will c other prof. don't or won't. AWESOME! REALLY CARES
5,THE PERSON THAT RATED ON THE APRIL 21  2010 NEEDED TO STUDY MORE. STOP GOING OUT TO PARTIES IF YOU ARE GOING BAD IN CLASS.AND STOP CHILLING IN CLASS. FIRST LOOK FOR YOUR STUDY METHOD AND ORGANIZE YOUR TIME. I TOTALLY AGREE THAT PROFESSOR TOWNSEL IS A GREAT PROFESSOR BUT IF YOU DO NOT STUDY IT IS OBVIOUSLY THAT U WON'T PASS ANY CLASS. SO DON'T BLAME
1,the previous comments are misleading she goes over material on a tuesday then will test on a thursday which is not enough time to study and complete the online tests and hmwk if you have a problem with a question she will not completely explain the answer but she has a nice personality
5,PROF. TOWNSEL IS A REALLY  REALLY GREAT PROFFESOR. SHE EXPLAINS VERY CLEARLY AND TRIES HER BEST FOR STUDENTS TO UNDERSTAND. SHE IS COOL AND SHE ALWAYS ANWERS YOUR QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT AND CORRECTLY. IF SHE MAKES MISTAKES SHE DOES NOT GET MAD  AL CONTRARY  SHE THANKS WHEN SOME CORRECT HER. IT IS REARLY THAT SHE MAKES THOSE MISTAKES.I HIGHLY RECOMM
5,The best teacher I've had in years... Keep it up please.
5,This is the best math teacher ever.If you want to pass take her.The class is extremely easy and she is a cool teacher
5,She is the bestestestest teacher ever! I love her so much! she does not understand how much she helped me in math this semester. I've taken this course once before and failed because i did not like professor toussaint (looks exactly like a frog) but she helped me earn wonderful grades on test and homework. If u do not like make this is who you need
5,TEACH VERY WELL
5,Before this class  I really hated math. But she helped everything to be so simple and clear. She is very patient  and the way she teaches is in a manner that even the slowest leaner can understand. She will repeat the lesson again and even review before going onto the next lesson. Totally recommended for those who hate math and want a good teacher.
1,The worst teacher ever. Drop the class  lost my money the worst experience at miami dade.
5,You will not regret taking this teacher. Math is my worst subject and I was able to maintain a B the entire semester. She is very helpful and will explain thesame thing a million times until she is sure that everyone understands
5,I hated this class even before taking it but she's made it so clear and easy that I can honestly say I like the class now. I thank God I got her as my professor in this class. I hope I get to have her as my professor in the next level of Math
5,One of the nicest people ever. never gets angry and is quite knowledged in the subject matter. She is very helpful and even though I am horrible at math  I passed with an S. You will not regret taking her
5,She is an awesome teacher! she makes it so easy. i used to suck really bad at math and now i feel like i know a lot of stuff and feel confident. thanks to her! she's awesome
5,Awesome  awesome  awesome! If you need help  she's there. But her style of teaching makes it so that there is really never a need for extra help. She rocks.
5,Very helpful and goes through the work very clearly. Never leaves questions unanswered.Is always trying to find out who needs help.
5,Dr. Dukes is always available to help and shows genuine interest in your research topics. He explains complex things in a clear way  but you do have to pay attention so you know how to ask the right questions. His notes are much more helpful than any textbook he assigns.
4.5,If you can take Dukes and avoid Lofton  DO IT. Your life will be so much easier. He is a great STATS teacher and I hated the subject. He is easy and helpful  and it is nearly impossible to get an A in any other CJ STATS course.
5,EASY class. He is the only sociology teacher with this easy of a class. I loved it! He is great. You have to read the books but they are actual books not text books. This class is so simple it's not even funny.
5,Without Dr. Dukes  I would not be a researcher today. Before taking him  I was scared of what he taught... Now I do it for a very good living. Thank you Dr. Dukes!!!
4.5,Dukes' personality made research methods much more interesting. A pleasant man and great professor.
3,This class is difficult. He is not always easy to understand (and sometimes it's him and not the topic). However  he's passionate about what he teaches. He's willing and available to help you. He's never condescending or mean when you don't understand. He's patient. He listens  and he will help you. He respects commitment to quality.
1,Arrogant  OCD personality. He guards the passing of a Thesis for his pick of students. He can be very rude/condencending when sitting on a Thesis Board. He believes that his view of writing/doing things is the ONLY way. His comments really hurt.
5,Just when I thought I couldn't take another minute of stupid multiple regression  Dukes assured me that I could! Wonderful prof and a truly decent human being.
5,Only had him once  but the university needs more teachers like him.
5,Love his animated ways of motivating positive feedback from his students. He is REALLY into what he teaches and is very highly thought of by former students and his faculty peers.
2.5,Very boring class  no class discussion....just lecture
4,Professor Houston is the man. dont mind the negative comments..easy going class  cool personable prof.
3,Houston is cool in my book. I found his class interesting and not boring either. I would probably say it was one f the best marketing classes taken at Rutgers. People don't understand the Capsim simulation used simply because they are to lazy to learn it.
2,Extremely unorganized and unfocused. Sort of absent-minded.

5,I truly recommend taking this class. I have never learned so much!! Her classes are very difficult  but definitely manageable. Her lectures are interesting and funny  and she is also very understanding.
5,Dr. Albanesi's classes are tough but you learn so much. I have taken several both undergrad and graduate level. You must do the reading! Most classes are discussion based. She is incredibly supportive of your learning process. I highly recommend her classes.
2.5,The lectures were so terribly boring. She was very unhelpful when I asked questions and seemed more bothered by my inquisition than anything else. Would not recommend.
4,Heather is awesome. She's not easy but she is not that hard either. If taking modern theory make sure to read EVERYTHING in order to get a high grade. Every point counts because she grades right down to the .00%. The readings are dry and horrible but she makes the best of it and keeps you engaged. Make her like you  she's a good networking contact.
5,Dr Albanesi is by far the greatest professor that I have taken at UCCS. I thought I was going to hate this class  but she made it incredibly interesting and it ended up being one of the best classes that I have taken during my undergrad. She is incredibly knowledgeable and her lectures are riveting!
5,Hands down one of the best instructors I've come across in a long time. She goes above and beyond to help her students. Shes extremely nice. And her lectures really help explain difficult concepts and theories. Material is difficult if very little experience with theory  but instructor provides engaging discussion to help learn and apply theory.
5,Great professor! She is very smart and very nice. Class lectures and discussions make sometimes difficult readings much more understandable.
5,There is a lot of reading within this class and it is pretty tough. interesting topics. A great professor  knows the information very well. The class discussion is a good way to learn a variety of ideas.
4.5,Awesome professor! Smart  funny  and enjoyable classes! Thanks  Heather!
4.5,Really exciting teacher. Very intense topics and use of knowledge  but very flexible on so many aspects of the class. The best advantage in her classes is be 100% honest and never be afraid to defend your theories.
5,Great Professor
4.5,Very knowledgeable in her field of study and teaching. Excellent  coherent lectures that greatly help the understanding of the readings. Lots of reading  tests were not too bad if you study enough. Do not have to take the final if you have a B+ or above by the last week. Nice class  learned a lot~
4,LOTS of reading  but if you pay attention the class isn't too bad. When I took it she let anyone who had above an 88% not take the final  so my entire grade was from two 3 point quizes  a 100 point midterm  and a 100 point essay.
4,She's a good professor and she makes the topics interesting. She teaches from power point a lot but it works for her. There is a lot of focus on homosexuals and the class is a little more interesting when you can relate it to yourself. There's a lot of reading but it can be a pretty easy A.
4.5,"I like her! She DOES talk very  very fast lol. But she is entertaining and doesn't out me to sleep! Very smart  smart woman. Funny too  some of the stuff she says is so off the wall and out of nowhere when she does to make a point but it's like ""Lol  that was funny."""

5,I had this prof for both social theory classes and she is a great teacher. Has a very extensive grasp of theory  good relationship with students and very willing to help anyone who asks. She challenges enough to be considered tough  but not to the point where students are overwhelmed. A definite asset to the school and the department.

1,she is a rude person and a awful teacher.
1,Treats us like we are already in the industry. Half of the things she tries to teach you are irrelevant to the the material. The problems on the tests are not like anything she ever goes over in class-they are 10x harder. Trust me I used to get straight A's in math and I almost failed this class. Drop it NOW unless you have industry experience.
1.5,I made the mistake of ignoring RMP.Com prior to taking this teacher. I should have dropped this professor like everyone said. This is potentially one of my least favorite profesors at FIT. DROP NOW IF YOU HAVE HER!!
1,If you like teachers who are understandable  repeat information and explanations when needed  and get the point then DROP. HER. CLASS. The worst decision I ever made was staying in it.
2,i always read comments that say drop this class.. but seriously DROP THIS CLASS. worst teacher ive ever had at fit. sets up the class for you to fail. talks more about her bmw than math..
1.5,SHE IS THE WORST TEACHER! DROP HER CLASS! She does not know how to teach and wastes time talking about nothing. She makes the class so much more difficult then it has to be.
1.5,DROP HER CLASS. she is one of the worst teachers i've had here. She goes on rants about un-relevant stuff  and confuses the crap out of you. If you actually want to learn something  get a good grade  or actually by some chance enjoy math...DO NOT keep her as a teacher.
1.5,WORST EVER - drop the class  honestly she is so confusing and her class is the most boring thing ever. Everyone in the class looks at each other like WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON! (so it's not just me). Her tests are hard  she thinks she's teaching - but she's really not. STAY AWAY
1,worst professor i've ever had. drop this class asap.
2,this was the worst class i have ever taken at fit. she's a nice woman  and she knows about the industry  but she does not know how to effectively teach. i had to teach myself the whole semester using the textbook because her methods were terrible. i suggest dropping this class.
3,I aced her class  but her exams are HARD. Why? She words the problems DIFFERENTLY than the HW and quizzes. To do well  review the 1st exam with her after you take it. (you will probably get a C to an F). Go to her office  ask for your exam  and question every problem on the exam. Understand her wording  and you'll be fine go forward.
4.5,She is an amazing teacher. Maths couldn't have been so interesting. She has a great knowledge about the industry. She treats you as an adult and does not believe in spoon feeding which I like.Very challanging class.
1.5,Surprisingly I got a B.She is unfair  and is not the best professor for this class.She is knowledgeable  and knows the material  but she does not communicate it to the class in an effective manner.It is not the end of the world if you get her  but don?t expect an A. Be willing to teach yourself everything  and make sure you memorize those formulas!
1,She is a smart woman but a difficult teacher because she doesn't know how to explain things to students who are not strong in math.
2,Bonnie and I did NOT make a good match. Nice lady and she means well  but you'll end up teaching yourself everything from the book- and then become lost because her test questions will be in a completely different format!! I struggled  but survived in the end- however I would never do it again.
1,Horrible teacher. Nice lady  but not a very good teacher. She tries to teach she just doesnt know how. You end up teaching yourself EVERYTHING from the book. Drop the class or stick with it and drop your GPA  your choice. good luck :-)
1,Worst class I ever took at FIT. I HATED BONNIE absolutely hated her. DROP THIS CLASS the minute you see her name. It will bring your GPA down and you will learn nothing as a result.
3.5,This class is not easy at all but not because of her. No matter what professor you have its hard. Youre going to have to do more work than youre used to but shes nice  and she has plenty of office hours for extra help. She will reexplain if you need during class. Study for 15 min everyday and you can't fail. This is coming from someone who got a C
4,I think she was OK. Not excellent  but OK. The class was not the easiest  but she did explain. Went over problems  reviewed for the exams. Sometimes I think the bad ratings are from students that come to the class unprepared  and then blame it on the teacher.
1.5,Honestly I hate Bonnie Johnson with a passion. She is the worst teacher I've ever met. She doesnt go over the work you do in your book. What kind of teacher makes you learn the work yourself and do homework on what you think you learned and then go over it in class in a completely different way then the book says. HOMEWORK IS TO REINFORCE BONNIE!!
3,Kaufman is down to earth and willing to provide help if you need it. To be honest his intro to philosophy class is the most difficult for me so far  because its very systematic and imaginative learning. I do not recommend taking this class early in the morning  because he solely lectures and drags on for the whole 50 minutes leaving me tired
2,Extremely boring and drawn out. Was quite condescending and rude at times. Although he gives decent study guides the tests are still quite hard. although I will say that there is no homework  aside from readings that are covered in class. That being said I still was not a huge fan.
2.5,His voice just isn't that interesting  and he seems to daydream into space a lot. I found myself getting distracted because I couldn't focus on what he was teaching. The subject itself is pretty complex and therefore I personally need an enthusiastic funny teacher  especially in the morning.
2.5,His voice just isn't that interesting  and he seems to doze into space a lot. I found myself getting distracted because I couldn't focus on what he was teaching. The subject itself is pretty complex and therefore I personally need an enthusiastic funny teacher  especially in the morning.
4.5,Passionate  extremely involved in the topics and theories. He's very expressive in presenting information  great class
5,Great professor...amazing...inspirational...do not take him if you're not interested in philosophy.
4,A really smart guy  and a good teacher. He's really god at making discussions interesting  and I don't think he's monotone at all. If you show an interest in the subject  he will respond with great positivity.
1.5,He was really bland and drawn out. I wouldn't suggest taking him unless you have to
3,Frederick is exactly what I expected in a philosophy professor: he takes long  drawn out pauses in mid-sentence while he stares into the distance  he speaks in a similar drawn-out tone  and he will ponder minutiae until the end of time. Overall  he's a pretty decent professor. Not terribly easy  not terribly difficult. Just decent.
5,Kaufmans great  he's really interested in his students and really passionate about his work. he's smart and fair. if you like philosophy  you'll like him.
4,He is a good guy  a fair grader  and an interesting lecturer. He's a really funny guy and he is open for discussion and student participation all of the time  but can sometimes be a little opinionated when teaching the material. I recommend him if you want to take an interesting class.
1,he is the worst professor I have ever had.
3,Interesting material but sometimes you'd have to strain to really be interested in it because his voice is monotone like others said. He's not a prof that's readily available to help either so you'll have to go out of your way. There are better professors.
4.5,Freddy knows how to run a laid back yet thought provoking class. He explains theories and hypothetical situatins with great clarity and humor. Tests are a bit hard but assignments are rare except for reading. This class  or any with Kauf for that matter is worth taking  whatever your major is.
3.5,Kaufman is very easy-going and his open class discussion instead of lecture keeps me awake and involved in class  motivating me to express my opinions and thoughts. If not interested in class discussion though  it can get pretty boring - his voice does have a slight drone to it but he can be funny.
3.5,Grades consistently so I guess I haven't figured out how to write to make my grades better. I can see people wanting to grow up to be him. I think as far as class goes  his open discussion instead of lecture is my ideal format for philosophy classes.
4,I want to become this man. I've had a couple of classes with him  and he's simply amazing. In upper level courses  expect to write something every week  but don't let that scare you off  it's really not a strain.
4,Thought the class was very good! He can be a bit monotone at times but the converstaions are always interesting. For a intro class I would say it was great. The tests can be a little challenging but they are managable! Overall I suggest this course!
2.5,Overall  the class is manageable. If you want him to help you  you'll have to go out of your way to ask for it. Exam questions can be worded a bit tricky  but they're all pretty much the same. His voice is funny and he speaks in a drawn out manner.
3,This guy seems to know his stuff really well but he is not an exciting lecturer..at least in the morning...snooze fest
1,This is 100% the worst professor I have ever taken at this university. She's is very monotone and hard to pay attention to. Her grading doesn't make any sense and is very unfair. I've been trying to get her fired  but unfortunately she hasn't done anything illegal.
5,I wrote my paper for this class before the semester started and did well with it. She gives weekly quizzes instead of something like 2 or 3 exams and it generally helps keeps people's grades up. She is the sweetest lady with a great sense of humor. She is very smart and fun.
3.5,Tests are based just off of the notes you take in class. Write down everything! If you can memorize all the notes then you should be fine. Some test questions are confusing. Gives a maximum of 3 percentage points for extra credit. Attend class every session that it is held and you will receive another bonus point. Overall  a pretty good teacher.
5,This lady is so knowledgable and professsional  but she keeps you interested and is absolutely hilarious at times. No boring power point or online teach yourself stuff
4.5,Super awesome teacher. You need to take notes and come to class. She does take attendance.
4.5,You work hard but you learn. Toth is an awesome professor!!!!
4,EPIC!
5,She makes you work but it is worth it. You will get the grade you deserve. everyone is treated fairly and equally.
5,Dr. Toth is super awesome. She makes you work fairly hard but her classes are fun and she is very genuine as a person
5,She is one of my favorites. if you can't learn in Dr. Toth's class you just can't learn. She will go ut of her way to help you and to make the class interesting. You get your mone's worth in her classes. Above all she really does care.
1,very boring class.she is so hard and very boring to listen too. her voice drones on and on. do not take her. Every class so far i have either and A or B on my transcript except hers i have a C. i was so close to failing. She lectures but then tells your her tests are not based on her lectures. terrible professor she likes to see kids fail.
4.5,Toth is absolutely hilarious. Went into her class not knowing anything about her  but very very happy I took her. Grade is on 4 tests
4,Dr. Toth is a fantastic prof. She makes what seems to be a boring subject pretty entertaining. She likes to make jokes and will connect with the students if the put in the effort. Quizzes are fairly simple if you take good notes and skim through the book. Be in class  use good grammer and turn everything in on time and you should get an A.
4.5,Dr. Toth is awesome. She was the reason I passed her class. She always makes sure you get missed assignments/quizzes done and turned in  and is always there to help. There is quite a bit of material and you should always go to class...but she is fun to be around  especially once you get to know her. One of my favorite psych professors!
5,She is an interesting professor who knows her discipline well. The tests are hard and you do have to come to class and take notes  but she is fair in grading.
3.5,dr toth is a nice lady but man her class was boring. she gives the notes right on the chalkboard and she talks the whole class. she was helpful when you had questions and she was a good prof just a little boring.
5,Dr. Toth is awesome. I really feel sad about the kids who did not understand her jokes - particularly since most of them are Psych majors  who will likely go on to deal with children. You have to comprehend subtlety if you want to work with children. Dr. Toth is a great teacher  very intelligent  fun and open-minded  and I have a huge crush on her.
4,Clear  funny  she cares about students  listens to student's and offers help.
4,One of the best on campus!
5,She has a very strange sense of humor but I found her very funny. She's very kind and always willing to help. I would definitely take her for other classes if I could.
2.5,My suggestion? Take history with someone else. Enough said.
3.5,she' kind of a bitter woman  and a little mean. Takes some hard work to get a decent grade  but if you're interested in the subject  and willing to do the work  it'll work out.
4,She's very intimidating...but still a great teacher. She makes the subject interesting...I didn't fall asleep in her class once :-P
1.5,Cannot stand here. She teaches based on her own personal views. I attempted to ask for help but all she was concerned about was blowing me off.
5,She's very funny and nice and she makes this class tolerable. She makes you learn without realizing you are learning and she does it while cracking jokes and playing music. Take a class with her  you won't regret it.
3,Sometimes she's interesting and sometimes she's boring but at least she makes jokes in class sometimes.
5,Nike is a real gem  and she cares very much about her students. She is sometimes a bit difficult to communicate with during classes  but she's absolutely hilarious  and a little patience goes a long a way.
5,Wonderful!!!
2.5,basically nike is a lot of fun  but she is not the best teacher in a formal sense. she is very interestng as a perosn though  i love her.
4,i LOVED nike!! she's a lot of fun  at the very least.

1,Professor Johnson rarely interacts with the students or uploads announcements. I would have to literally look all over the class section on Blackboard to find assignments as well as teach myself the material. Would not recommended this class or professor.
5,My class was once a week and 4 hours (stats class). She did not give us any homework since the class was so long. I think sh explained things well but statistics is just difficult for me as it is for most people. She let us use a notecard on one of the tests. She really was great though and I recommend her. Sometimes she would let us out early.
4,I completely disagree with most of the comments about Professor Johnson. The reason all of you think badly about her classes is simply because MATH IS HARD! I was never good at math but I got an A in her class simply because I payed attention! If you don't do good in her class it's simply because you did not pay attention!!!!!
1,Worst professor I've ever had. One of the worst experiences of my life. She doesn't like to teach or explain anything to you if you had a question or problem with a lecture. She is completely USELESS. I think she needs to retire from teaching because I felt very alone in this process and at times helpless when I was stuck on something. NEVER AGAIN
1,This was the worst course I have ever taken  horrible experience! This professor is beyond unhelpful. When you get a problem wrong she doesn't explain what's wrong about it and just expects you to come up with the answer out of thin air after. She doesn't respond to all your emails so it makes it very difficult to communicate with her. STAY AWAY!!!
1,TAKE MY WORD FOR IT. DO NOT TAKE HER. She is such a rude person  doesn't care about her students  doesn't thoroughly teach. If you don't understand something  too bad. When you ask questions  she will either laugh OR not even acknowledge you. I learned by asking OTHER STUDENTS  not the arrogant professor! Please don't take her! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
1,She's the worst teacher I have ever had when it comes to math. She doesn't respond to questions and is rude. When you ask a question she will simply ignore it. The videos she posts are full of mistakes . Why do teachers teach anymore if they seem to not care about their students?
1,I took Math Ideas online... Only take this class of you are really good at Math it is really hands off  I wouldn't say I learned anything from the professor. I had to teach myself the whole time. math ideas is theoretical math  meaning work problems  puzzles  etc. This was not for me I am more of a Algebra and geometry type.
1,"She wrote this to the whole class: ""I will point out where your mistakes are  NOT what you must do to fix them. It is your responsibility as part of the learning process  to go over the lecture again. Then you should work the problems in the lecture and compare what you did with what is in the lecture."" What is the point of a professor then"
2.5,This class is hard when it doesn't have to be. She spends an incredible amount of time going over things like how to find mean and median and not enough going over new concepts. She does let you use notes for one test and drops your lowest grade. I got an A  but the class was much more challenging than it should have been.
1,Easy class but she is rude  not helpful at all  tells you your answer is wrong and let's that be that. The lectures can be a bit confusing but the math is not hard to comprehend. Take her if you feel comfortable with the subject/ must take it  but she is kind of awful.
1.5,I'm taking my final class for my math minor  which is online. I've never had a problem understanding the subject matter in math classes but this woman really just DOES NOT teach. She gives videos of her punching in numbers to excel sheets and expects you to understand the bigger picture. Any messages from her are rude and short with no personality
1.5,DO NOT TAKE HER FOR AN ONLINE COURSE. I can't speak to her teaching in class  but she is possibly the rudest  inconsiderate online teachers at FIT. Just tells you you're wrong  but not how to fix it. Has no regard or interest in teaching our class WHATSOEVER.
1,If you have her as your teacher - drop out! she is the owrst teacher. doesn't care about her students  disrespectful and unwilling to help. She enjoys seeing her student fail and is rude. She should not be teaching! she is one of those teachers that doesn't care because she has tenure and cannot be fired.
3,Grat teacher! Very clear  good personality  to the point. Goes over material and works on buddy system for in class work. No homework  though it's up to you to study for the exams.
2,Completely unfair  unreasonable  and disrespectful. I had to BEG her to have a meeting with me to discuss a grade. When I finally met with her she rushed me out before I could even finish making my point. Made errors grading my midterm and didn't understand how until i explained step by step how i was correct. More than once.
2.5,I think she's a nice lady but she's not the best teacher. I took two of her courses so far and both of them were so slow and boring.
2,Online Mathematical Ideas course  one of the worst professors in the school  not helpful also hard grader. I woud say SKIP
4,she's Nice.
5,Yeah you have to ork  but she's very helpful. She knows her stuff.
4.5,He gives homework every night but doesn't check it  just goes over it in class and calls on people to answer. The tests aren't hard unless you don't pay attention or don't take any notes. He is a really nice guy but really likes his job so is very serious about the class.
4.5,When you first meet him  he seems a little stiff and uptight but then he kinda loosens up. Hes not the funny guy but he is nice. Dont get the book  your wasting your money. Print out the power points for each class and take notes on them while he is speaking. You have 2 test (not midterm/final) and then the final. and also have to do a presentati
5,"He is awesome! Keep good notes and try to understand - you'll be fine. This teacher will give examples related to real life  so that the ""science"" part sticks better. I wish I had this teacher for all my classes."
5,Fair. Explains and teaches the material well  very articulate... gives a good challenge. Nice guy... If you have common sense  class isn't too hard. Easier than my high school chem and physics classes by far.
4,Very nice guy and very knowledgeable  different type of person that's all  he's the head of math depart so you figure. The contents are very interesting if you like science. Take notes or even better just listen to the class and understand. Very open for questions  always willing to answer. Makes you think. Fair amount of hw. Really enjoyed! =)!
4.5,Take as much notes as possible. His tests are a bit difficult  but if you study your notes you can actually do good!!!
1,uptight teacher
5,Professor LaBarge is simply the best! If you want to enjoy learning  take him.
4.5,Class is fun and centered around discussion. There is a lot of reading but you'll want to do it for the discussions. Other than participation  the rest of the grade is papers. If you like to write and discuss philosophy  this is a great class.
5,Just a solid guy.
4,So passionate about the subject and his students. Just a really good professor.
5,He is one of the nicest and humble people I have ever met! He very helpful with papers  attentive to his students  and funny! Do the readings and show that you are working hard and you will get a good great.
4.5,SUCH a great professor. Very helpful  funny  and interesting. Lectures might get a little boring some days  but for the most part the discussions were stimulating and thought provoking. Reading is pretty dense and heavy but he goes over it pretty clearly and answers all questions. Definitely turned out to be one of my favorite classes!
5,Labarge is the man. There is some reading to do  but the guy is a great lecturer. He's hilarious and entertaining. If you pay attention and read you should be able to get at least an A-. For papers  go in for help! He is extremely helpful on papers!
5,Awesome teacher. If you go in to see hi  before a paper is due to get his feedback and help  you will get no less than an A-. He is clear about what he wants and is extremely eager to help his students. It is so clear how much he cares for his students. He truly wants them to learn and will do anything he can to help them excel. TAKE LABARGE
4.5,He is such a funny  quirky guy. In-class discussions are never boring. The readings were long at times  but so interesting
4,He is funny and clear in lectures. He makes classics more fun than it should be. Quite the slow grader  but understandable since he has young children at home.
4,Really great guy. He is very passionate about philosophy and is very attentive to the students needs. A lot of class discussion  and be sure to speak up a lot so he can get to know you. It will help you out when you need to talk to him or if you need letters of recommendation. A LOT of reading  not always interesting  but topics were fascinating.
4.5,Very caring professor and class is usually a debate. Be careful though if your views differ from the majority and especially his. If you think differently be careful with your arguments
5,My favorite prof my first quarter at Santa Clara! He's very friendly and engaging  it made me look forward to going to his class! Definitely try to take his classes!!!
5,Hands down not only the coolest prof/teacher I have ever had  but probably the coolest (and yes  nerdiest) guy i know outside of my own age group. He's the kind of professor you wish you could just hang out with all the time outside of class. Classes can be a bit heavy on the reading  but if you have a chance to take one of them dont pass it by!
4.5,Really funny and explains things very clearly. My favorite class.
5,He is a huge nerd but very funny and entertaining. There is a lot of reading!!! It is a socratic class so you don't need to talk and therefore do not need to do the reading all of the time. However  if you don't do the reading it will bite you in the ass when it comes to the final. He is an easy grader if you do what he says. I recommend him!
4,Very good teacher. Very interesting class  and very interesting to talk with him. He will help you out if you are in need and also makes class very enjoyable. He's very clear with what he teaches and what he expects  I definitely think he's one of the better teachers I've had at SCU. Don't even need to buy textbooks. He puts them all on angel
4.5,He is an amazingly cool guy. He is very easy to talk to and even though he does not have a lot of extra time to spare  if you need help he WILL find time for you always.
3,The reading assignments were ridiculously long  and a lot of them were very dry. But after the first few classes you realized that he gives a synopsis of the assignment every day  so you don't REALLY have to read them all. He's very popular during office hours  so get therer early and be prepared to wait.
5,Possibly the best class I ever had
4,He is a cool guy and he is a fair grader.
5,Best teacher I ever had
5,My favorite Prof at BCC - tk him for Comp 1 & 2. If you don't get an A  you're lazy o't do all the work. If you don't get a B  you probably don't belong in college. Prof OB made learning easynd fun. I have no pblem writing research papers in all my classes. Thanks Prof OB.
1,Best prof in BCC - best I ever had in five semesters. He's the man - he makes learning fun and interesting - take h1s class
5,es techer I ever had - interesting every day  fun. You learn so much. Now I can write a research paper. Thank you
5,Awesome professor! 2 papers 2 exams but all really easy! Attend Class to get the most points and doing all the work  which is very little  will definitely get you an A!
5,This guy is a great teacher. He explains the work clearly and all you need to do is write 2 essays  which he works with you  complete a few worksheets over the semester and pass the final. I highly recommend Mr.O'Brien.
5,no text book needed. so you save $ whoo the only way to get a bad grade in this class is to not do work if you do the papers you get an A
5,really easy class! you do two essay and take two tests one which doesn't even count. both papers are 7 pages each but he requires you to first turn in a 5 page then 6 page of them so you can expand it into a 7 page. as long as you DO IT you get an A.
5,He was an awesome professor. This class is very easy and the only way to fail by not doing your work. He gives you the grading policy and he is also very helpful and he even let you out of class early. if you want to take an easy class he is definitely the professor to have.
5,Awesome prof - if you want to learn how to write  this is the man. Interesting  helpful  and actually teaches so you learn. My favorite at BCC.
5,Great teacher. Usually lets us out of class early. the ONLY way you can fail his class is if you're lazy. Do the work  show up you'll get an A.
4,Very great  organized and straight forward professor.
5,Great teacher! super easy and helps with any questions you have. We didn't have to buy a text book. He is very nice  and I would take him again for another class.
5,I loved him. He cares about his students. Go to class  do the work  and you'll get a good grade. I went back to school after many years and he helped me more than any other professor. He's fun and interesting. I wish I had more classes with him. A great professor. Easy A if you try.
5,I finally learned how to write a research paper. Class is great and you learn so much stuff. Hes a great teacher and a great guy.
5,Time flies by. Do your work and hand it in on time. Youll learn how to write and will enjoy the class.It was my favorite class.
5,Good easy professor. Just do the work and you'll pass. He assigned only two papers throughout the semester and all we had to do was revise/peer edit them every few weeks. He also teaches basic grammar which was extremely easy  and it helped me improve my writing. He can be a bit boring with his lectures though.
3.5,I'm NOT impressed. I do agree that he is easy and I do love the way he teaches. But  unfortunately  he doesn't seem very sympathetic towards students with disabilities.
5,My highschool guidance counselor told me that he is the best teacher at Bergen. He is great and makes class interesting and real.
1,Horrible teacher! Ask questions his answer is either I think so or no I can't show examples cause it would take too much class time...I think taking a week to go over the intro of each chapter takes more class time. No one pays attention or shows up for lectures only good thing is he curves every test.
1,I highly suggest that you don't take his online course. He's very unorganized and is unclear with directions. He takes forever to respond to emails. He also grades your group as a whole for discussions instead of individually so you can get screwed over if your group doesn't participate which I thought was so unfair. Online exams are very difficult
1.5,DO NOT TAKE HIM. 2 weeks to read the syllabus to us word for word. 2 days to split up the class into equal groups that you never talk to. Tests are online but impossible to pay attention in class so not easy. Very rude. Spends the first half hour of a 50 minute class going over everything we did the day before. It's miserable save yourself.
1,literally the most rude professor ive ever had.
2,Well. Took two weeks for the syllabus  a week and a half to split up into groups that you literally will never talk to. He does not know how to answer questions well  however does give extra points back on exams if many people argue the questions.
1,Alrighty... Where to start! I guess at the very beginning. The first class or should I say the first three classes were spent on just the syllabus! Seriouslly he read word for word... I forgot we are in college and can't read. Very rude to other instructors  not very computer knowledgeable. Took 2 classes to split class of 60+ in to 8 groups!
2,Whatever you do drink an amp or something before class he is sooo boring and very repetitive and it also took us literally two classes to divide into groups but the class is fairly easy all exams are online and open book
1,Avoid him at all costs.
2,seriously save yourself an awful semester and avoid him at all cost. also the book is pointless and I'm so sick of hearing him repeat himself 4928097 times. im trying to save you don't take this.
2,After 3 weeks of boring  mono tone  repetative 'dr' colcord...I finally had enough. You want to know how boring it is? He went over the syllabus for a week and a half...5 class meetings. And  im not kidding  it took him 35 minutes to divide the 60 student class into 8 groups. He uses all his material online like I signed up for an online course!
5,Very nice prof!
1,Uninteresting way of presenting interesting material.
3,Dr. Colcord repeats everything at least 5 times. I don't reccommend that you buy the book  because he rarely uses it. He takes attendance randomly throughout the semester for a grade. I found the material taught interesting  but how it was delivered was very  very dry.
4,Okay seriously don't buy the book - you won't ever use it! It's a pretty easy class. He's a great guy and he explains everything a couple times very clearly so if you go to class you'll be fine.
1.5,Try to take Copper for this class instead because he doesn't know how he wants to teach his class.
4.5,Dr. Colcord is a real nice guy and his class in general is pretty easy. His tests and exams are awesome as he has a curve which saved me on both of them  you can get away with not going to class some of the time but id go 2 days out out of the three. Always there to help you out.
3,No Comments
5,great teacher  and very helpful always gives prompt email help  and the papers arent really that hard...
5,Awesome woman and teacher. Very clear about topics and what is important to understand for exams. Open to new ideas and methods  and allows for a lot of extra credit. Definitely recommended as a teacher for any class!
5,Best professor I've ever had!!!!!
5,"Cathy is the best instructor for Psychology! She wants people to understand the ""concept"" of things  and not just ""memorize"". However  the quizzes can be a little tricky if you do not pay attention. She gives fun assignments in and out"
3.5,Very knowledgable and pretty funny. Isn't the best explainer and is terrible with answering questions in class. Gives a lot of small papers and tough quizzes  but grades decently. Class can be boring at times and never gets cancelled.
2,Ugh  he apparently graded himself 5 times on this because he is not wonderful. His tests have 20 questions on it  so you can imagine its 5pts each question. You can retake  but if its hard the first time dont expect much the next times. Overall dont expect leniancy its just an illusion  if u messed up on the test its over for you.
5,good guy  very friendly will help you out alot
5,Great Online teacher.
4,Great guy  really cool...class was easy and you learn from real world experience. got A- :-)
4.5,Very understanding
5,Great Teacher. This is the 3rd course I have had with him.
4.5,This was my favorite class last semester. I think the reason it was so easy for me was because I was generally interested in what I was learning. She gave the option of using our quiz grades in place of a final  so I studied a lot for every one and got an A. I love the notes being on WebCT  too. Just an awesome class all around. She is so nice
4,I honestly felt like I was in elementary school. All her quizzes were 10 questions and multiple choice. All her notes are on webct. The material is easy to begin with  but Ivy makes it so a 10 year old could pass with flying colors. Easiest A Ive ever gotten. Although the class is soooo easy  Ivy is also a genuinely sweet individual.
4,Looks very young  is a grad. student teacher. Gives us notes and relatively easy tests. Rushes through material a lot and gets flustered if she runs out of time. Tends to be picky about small details. Friendly in class  but not really one on one.
4,Good teacher  strict  not hot at all.
4.5,She gives a lot of homework and quizzes but is really enthusiastic and wants students to learn. Good about giving extra help outside of class and grades fairly.
3,Don't like her much. Picks her favorites and sticks with them. Such a young teacher  but acts like she's 87 years old.
4.5,gives a lot of tedious homework. pretty good otherwise
5,Gives a lot of homework  its pretty easy and is worth it. Very nice and just wants her students to do well.
4,Very enthusiastic. Is eager for students to succeed. very fare
5,wicke dnice teacher  very biased and feministic  has her favorites  overall shes fair though  lot of work  real nice in and out of class
5,buon giorno sabrina! solid prof. clever style and even better smile...
4.5,WAY too strict on attendance  cool teacher though she's very friendly and makes class pretty interesting  gives a little too much partner work which is a pain in the ass but all in all one of the better teachers i've had in college
5,she's the coolest teacher i've ever had
4,very well prepared to teach the course... goes out of her way to make sure students understand concepts. there is a lot of pier work and out of class work  but that is essential to mastering a language.
5,Definitly gives to much work but very nice. Always wants to help students out.strict on attendence which she warns you about every class. A lot of partner excercises  some times makes class a big pain in the ass. Not a difficult class though boring though
3,has her favorites. dont like her much. can be very snotty and biased. shes got her pets too.
4,Very knowledgable and a pretty good teacher. VERY strict about absences and missed worked  and doesn't ever cancel class. Does a lot of partnering of students for group work and discussions. Pretty friendly outside class.
5,No Comments
4,Very funny professor! 80% of his lecture is him telling stories. He gives out extra credit questions when attendance is low. Exams are really tricky! A lot of stuff is on them that was never covered in class. Also is slow to respond to emails  and to grade.
1,Youll wonder why you even bother to show up to class  which consists of personal stories and repremanding you for not having a commanding knowledge of material he never covered.
4,He literally gives you everything you need to get an A. Technically  he even gives you the quizzes and exams. Just fill them out and study them and youre all good.
5,Its true that Dr. Gordon is always. It is also true that he quite possibly one of the most unorganized professors I have ever had. He probably will never give your paper back  or any feedback BUT  having said that he is probably the best professor I have ever had. He doesn't even try and I have learned so much in his classes.
1,He's a nice and funny guy. But he is so unprepared and doesn't know how to use Sakai or a computer for that matter. Never responds to student emails. Never know when the exams or quizzes are going to be. He lectures about personal life 90% of time. Makes an easy A course hard to pass. Don't take.
5,Very helpful with providing any additional help needed for this course!
1,Nice guy  but AWFUL prof never hands things back and he is the most unorganized prof you will ever have. Does not have actual notes. Text book is very unclear. You won't know what you have in the class until final grades are in. Unless you have a lot of time to devote to this class do not take it! It is not an easy A!
4,Great professor  super nice. He is the type of professor who cares more about student's learning than grade  and actually means it. He is a super caring guy and really wants to help students. He has many great life stories to share and will not fail you as long as you show up and be respectful  and try. Easy class  and teaches a lot!
4,Gordon's class is super easy if you take the time to memorize the map quizzes. They are basically an easy grade. He also gives tons of extra credit and he gives 3 free questions on each exam. Definitely take this for an easy A.
5,Awesome guy a little slow grader but impossible to do bad i skipped a quiz and still got a 91
4,Nice guy  gives you study guides for exams  7 map quizzes. If you actually study  you'll do well. Don't bother buying the book
3.5,Great professor but something you should know right off the bat is that tests arent multiple choice. Theyre matching  true and false  and a type of fill in the blank. He knows a lot of interesting facts but the textbook isn't really necessary. You need to study but he offers a lot of help. You never use the textbook so don't buy it
4.5,He's always 5 minutes late but he's always there for students. He will let you know exactly where you stand in class and is always willing to help you improve. Funny guy too when he relates his stories about his son Ian in class. Definitely take a class from Dr. Gordon.
5,Took his land development class S-11. Great class and well taught. Anyone who is even remotely interested in business ventures and development can learn a ton! He really has a vast education and you can see a lot of his studies come out in this class. Really helped me out as the class/projects progressed. Overall very interesting class and teacher
4,Dr Gordon is kind of hilarious. I learned a lot of random info... he made me a better trivial pursuit player. study for map quizzes  they are an easy way to boost your grade  and the tests are really not that hard... mostly right out of the notes he gives out with the syllabus. he's a good guy  and wants his students to do well.
5,He's a great guy  and pretty funny in class. He's ALWAYS late  which is no big  just go to class and listen when he talks  you'll be fine. It may be a little bit boring  but he'll tell you that at the beginning.
4,He's late a lot. The class is a lot of memorization and less actual thinking. Straight lecture with pretty good stories thrown in. He likes to throw out trick questions - just let someone else answer them wrong. If you understand you *will* need geography in life  you'll do well enough.
5,Took as a summer class  very very intelligent professor. Never learned so much from a 4 week 100 level class. Grading is VERY fair and you know he wants everyone to do well. Def take this class with this professor
3.5,Attendance was so low for every class  and fellow students constantly brought computers to surf facebook during lectures. Gordon could have made the classes dry and unbearable  but he really made them fun. As long as you study what he goes over on the exam review  the tests are simple. You have to do some simple research on your own sometimes.
3,"Prof. Gordon is actually quite awesome  it's just so many students now fail to know anything about geography  and one in my class even quoted the subject as ""useless!"". I received As  but because of the stupidity of the students  he had to grade on a curve so they wouldn't all fail. Shame on the youth of America  NOT DR. GORDON."
4.5,very clear. weekly quizes are easy and the curve at the end of the class makes it impossible to do bad
3,Tests/quizzes require you to think the way he thinks  and sometimes it's quite difficult to see what he's getting at. He never uses the assigned text and his lecture slides are often unclear and loaded with mathematical jargon. He makes up for all this with a very generous grading scale that makes it almost impossible to get anything less than a B.
2,Mostly  the man is just mean.
4,Coop is an ass  but he knows it. I think he's just decided to run with it. Feel free to make fun of him he seems to enjoy it! The class isn't bad but you need to do some thinking on your own.
4.5,Classes are not really necessary  but experiments are fun and the exams aren't too difficult. I really enjoy the case studies that he brings up in class. He definitely is one of those teachers that you either like or you dont.
1.5,I STRONGLY dislike this man. Class is interesting enough  but he spends the whole time talking about these interesting case studies and experiments... that do not help you at all on the test. The weekly quizzes are a pain and regularly going to class and reading book won't help you on the tests.
3.5,Hes not a bad teacher  hes really boring with his powerpoint presentations but experiments make the class interesting. Basically no work all semester except for final.
5,Very helpful  insightful  and capable of applying economic theory to a multitude of markets and arenas.
2,not a very good teacher  comes off as kind of a jerk
5,Has clear expectations of his students  and offers lots of out of class time to help. Does his best to make a difficult class managable and useful  especially to ECON majors.
5,Effective command of material and can teach well  class is also enjoyable with in class experiments.
2,what a jerk
4.5,Interesting class and good professor. Extremely knowledgeable and sometimes intimidating  but is not a difficult grader.
4.5,No Comments
5,Good professor. Puts a lot of effort into the course.
5,No Comments
4.5,my best non engineering professors  loved the course
5,you either loved him or hated him for the most part. i loved him as a prof
4,No Comments
4,kinda arrocant but a good teacher
5,I took my first class with him the summer before my freshman year. It was in 1972  and my first college course  and I loved him! I took another course later with him  and loved him also then. It has been many years  but his teaching still impacts my life. He was one of the reasons why I eventually changed my major to Sociology.
3.5,At first I though this course was some sort of joke and this was what sociology was all about. After  taking two classes I realise this is bs. Do not take this class unless you want to hear about his life(no disrespect). You will not learn nothing.
1,This class is ridiculous. I would NOT recommend. Attendance isn't mandatory but if you want to pass you should probably go. He's interesting to listen to in class but there are only two exams  solely based on stories he tells in class and I learned absolutely nothing about sociology.
4,Best professor I had in college. He was my professor in the 1970's and 80's. Changed my life by encouraging critical thinking and creative ideas.
3,Been out of college for 35+ years and still think about him. Unique and true. Changed my way of thinking about life. Sometimes a loaf of bread is just a loaf of bread.
4.5,Trav is great. His class is more a philisophical look at sociology than a true scientific one but is well worth hearing his point of view. His lectures are always amusing though it can be difficult to link his anecdotes to the subject material at times. Exams are easy and he'll bend over backwards to help if you ask.
5,He saved my life ! I came to the university in 1979 I had just gotten a GED and was enrolled in the talent devlopment program. Prof Trav   as everyone called him became my friend - more than anything he listened to me and accepted my short comings. Made me feel I belonged and I was worthy of an education .very dear man to me !
3.5,Love this class. All you have to do is show up and listen. the exams are super easy if you come to class. Hes a really funny guy with a unique sense of humor. One of a kind at URI
1,Absolute worst professor I've ever had. Gives URI a bad name. We took a midterm on Oct. 25 and didn't get it back until December 4th. Sure  he tells entertaining stories  but he really has no interest in his students. His lectures are to hear himself speak. A total of 20 students show up and he doesn't seem to care.
4.5,Funny  interesting  knowledgeable and an overall great teacher and person.
4.5,I really enjoyed his class. Great guy. He was fun and interesting to listen to. Some of the points he makes really make you think.
1.5,This man is really hard to follow and his questions really have nothing to do with the subject. It is very easy to get a good grade but if you actually want to learn something I would not recommend this class.
4,Prof Travisano is great. He really makes class interesting. He is paramount when it comes to the subject matter and he has great life experiences to match!! I think he is truely unique and wish he taught more courses in sociology. He is brillant and down to earth which makes him exceptional.
5,Professor Travisano was and I presume still is second to none.
3,Everyone needs a break  and that where Travisano comes in place. He's hilarious & well respected by other staff. Because he's taught at URI for so long  he can teach how he wants too. Nobody should be complaining about him  because those who are  are the same ones who are so happy to get an A. So...appreciate him.
1,Awful. So ashamed I attend a university that allows this man to teach and waste salary on. His schtick is being wacky and telling stories but this is ridiculous to be listening to in a classroom setting. Avoid at all costs.
3,A very interesting man  scattered ideas but offers a unique perspective of the world. Hard to get in contact with. Travisano has experiences  that he doesn't mind sharing  that no other professor would dare to talk about.
1,Biggest waste of time and money. His exams are a joke and is more interested in entertaining than actually teaching.
1,honestly  he is a terrible teacher and does not teach you a darn thing! His class is full of nonsense and his tests are just full of ridiculous questions that he like pulled out of nowhere. He really needs to learn how to teach!
3.5,Travisano is the man. If you go to class everyday (which is worth it because his lectures are always hilarious) then you will have no problem getting an A even if you don't read the books.
5,This professor is awesome! I HIGHLY recommend taking his class  you won't be disappointed.
5,He is awesome.
5,"AWESOME TEACHER!!!!~ HIS STUDY GUIDES ARE LITERALLY THE TEST!!!~ IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO RECEIVE AN ""A"" IN THIS CLASS...UD HAVE TO BE A MORON!...& NO ATTENDANCE IS TAKEN!"
5,AWESOME!
5,Fun teacher good guy
5,GREAT PROFESSOR. LOTS OF EXTRA CREDIT  AND HE GIVES ALL THE QUESTIONS TO THE TEST THE CLASS BEFORE
5,No Comments
4,Boggess is awesome  sure he's easy and you dont learn much but hell yeah he's cool as hell...a good man
5,Best of the best!!! Dean Van Bibber could learn a lot from him!!!
1,Needs to go. Take him if you like boring classes.
5,Very easy and very nice...gives you worksheets with all the test questions on them. Great teacher!
3,No Comments
5,His classes are extremely boring! We plays entirely too many videos! He doesn't really teach anything. His study guides are exactly what is on the test! You only have to go to class to take the test because he has no attendance policy!!
4.5,good teacher  provides good study sheets
4,Very easy. Study guides were taken directly from the book and then the tests are exactly like the study guide
5,One of the best teachers FSC has to offer. On the same level as Dean Van Bibber. Has the experience to back up the book knowlege. Highly recommended.
5,One of the best teachers I have ever had. Do not see how anyone could fail his tests.
5,He is a very good teacher and part of one of the best well rounded departments at FSC. The CJ department is outstanding in teaching as well as having experience in different fields in which they teach now.
5,Very intelligent and a hard worker.
5,Outstanding Teacher
1,His class was unbearable.
1,Terrible professor  was extremely easy for me to do the work in the class  but that's because it all revolves around study guides and learning where countries were on the map. I can assure you that this class is a waste of time  and that this teacher will spend 95% of the class time talking about his grandson or other things other then teaching.
1.5,DO NOT RECOMMEND!
1,Worthless lump of a man. Currently in his class  and DOES NOT TEACH. His class sessions are him talking about unrelated topics and assigning a study guide spanning two chapters that he doesn't talk about AT ALL. Then he has you turn them in  and then do a test a few weeks later with the same questions. Terrible prof.  the book is the only teacher.
2.5,He is not a terrible teacher. The class is really very easy. You just have to tell him every class period that he forgot something. You can't expect him to do what he is supposed to. Just follow the study guide and the tests are pretty well straight off that.Also  sit in the front and talk alot. He will help you more if he knows you're interested.
1,very hard not Helpful
1.5,Joshi is a rude man with a huge ego. I can understand him.This issue isnt his speech. Half of what he says is gibberish unrelated to the class. He messed up my gpa and cares little about students. While writing a important paper he used my laptop to answer a question. he then told me to turn it off because I was distracting the class. Do not take!
3,Good man.
1,DON'T TAKE HIM. He 'forgets' to grade things and loses everything. If you have to take him  make copies of EVERYTHING. Class is not structured or organized in any way. Some study guide questions aren't in the book or on the internet. He won't help you. Ruined my 4.0
2,talks about everything buy geography. Didn't give me credit for 2 quizes and a test b/c he forgot.
1,If you wanna class that you take VERY little noted  cant understand the teacher and you learn nothing in class then this is the teacher for you. He talks bout his life more than anything. You do need to stay with the schedule or you will fail. Map tests are easy and chapter tests are easy and you can retake them  but I wouldnt pick his class to tak
2.5,The first day he seems hard to understand  but you get used to it. His class as a whole is simple  do the study guides and homework he gives you Attendance is not necessary as long as you keep up with the work If you ask him a question though  he tends to turn it around  and ask you the exact question you just asked him so not helpful in that sense
4,he is as easy as they come. if u can't pass his class  u should go back to kidergarten. and for the ones who can't understand him  open up to the world. not everybody in in the world(or america for this matter) talk with a country accent.
1,difficult class.... hard to understand
1,No Comments
1,Terrible teacher  hard to understand  and makes it a point to single out students for his own amusement. I would not reccomend him unless you are from Nepaul like him.
2.5,Study the study guides  they are the test and the ticket to an A. Hard to understand because of his accent  but the class wasn't that tough.
1,Worst teacher....i counted once and he said right 50 times in a half hour.....i have no idea what he is ever saying ...right?
1,I hated this class... it was a waste of time and money... The first week all you talk about is his althritis. You dont do any geography unless you do the study guides. He is a very nice person but he also is rude and belittles students for expressing their thoughts. he also talks bad america! :(

5,Mr. Howard was a great teacher. Laid back and easy-going. He's the type of guy that you could go to a bar and get a beer with. Learned a lot from him.
4.5,Very laid back and easy going  very fun teacher.... only bad thing is he is a state fan! lol

3,Chirico is unorganized and hard to follow.
3,She's a very nice lady  but this class is extremely boring. She makes you do five papers throughout the semester on the in-class exercises  which aren't hard to do. She's a very fair and easy grader. There are four quizzes as a means of evaluation - no tests  which is nice. The class wasn't hard  but I'd take another class for the GS credit.
2.5,Absolutely terrible class. She's boring and extremely feminist. Only bonus given away is only for women and some things she makes mandatory have no relevance to the class. Complete waste of time
3.5,very smart
2,She was very dry and boring. Kindof graded weird. I really don't think she liked that class a lot  she is more of a soc teacher so I never felt her dedication to crimj.
4,No Comments
2,She was very passionate abt. what she taught but not clear on what she was teaching and wanted for assignments. Overall her classes are very boring.
4.5,Such a sweetheart!!!!! Some of her assignments were a little tedious  but overall I loved this course! I thought that the service learning (volunteering) she makes us do would have been a pain  but it actually helped me find out what I want to major in  premedicine. Dr Chirico is great!
4,"Very good teacher even though she is a little into ""man-bashing."" I would advise anyone to take her classes as she is a very fair and intellingent instructor."
3,Could this class be any more depressing? Everyday I go and learn about how horrible the United States is in the world and all the dozens and dozens of things that are wiping out babies everyday. A day doesn't pass that she doesn't warn of World War III which will be about drinking water. Save your Aquafina!
2,She's a BIG feminist. Play along or you will not get a good grade.
5,this class should not be taken by any normal student at penn state beaver. you need to read and learn to present arguments to things you normally wouldnt think of arguing. she is a brilliant teacher probably one of the best on campus. she is also a very good person to go to for advice because she is very knowledgable on most topics.
4.5,She is slamming hot.
5,Dr. Chirico is an awesome teacher. She likes when you have an opinion and even disagree with her opinions sometimes. As long as you talk and have an opinion in class she will love you. The 20 hours of community service can be rough  but rewarding in the end. She tries to help the community.
5,She is a Great professor who really knows what she's doing. Unfortunately  her courses are very difficult and not worth it. Do NOT take this course for a simple GS credit. Unless you like writing atleast 1 paper a week and 20 hrs community service. Take ECON  for the same GS credit VERY EASY.
5,Great teacher. Lots of fun. Also  very hot!
5,Enjoyed her classes greatly  Lots of work to be done but its worth it in the end. You can learn a great deal if you are just willing to do the work and try hard. Stop complaining about the work load and do it.
3,Good teacher but personally I like Ms Muroski at Hazleton better.
5,great class  great teacher. very clear lectures  de-emphasizes test scores and puts more weight on papers because they are clearer indications of what we actually learn.
4.5,one of the best prof's at psu beaver. maybe disorganized  but admittedlet so and she isn't afraid to laugh at herself. funny  smart  and hot for her age.
4,She's amazing! I took an express 3 week course for M2 that I was nervous about since math isn't one of my strong suites. But prof Yarmish goes slow and makes everything crystal clear. Very patient and she truly wants all her students not just to pass  but to understand the material for future math courses you may need to take.
1,Professor Yarmish is tough! She has a cold attitude and doesn't care about her students. She's very cut and dry and doesn't take any effort into consideration. Downgrades your grade for the smallest thing.
5,Very clear. Makes sure everyone understands. Listen in class and do the assignments and you'll do great. Also make sure to ask if something is not clear.
1,No!!! If you are not good in math  don't take her. That's one of those professors who expect you to know everything before you came to class.
5,She is great. A little bit boring  but makes sure everyone gets everything. I guarantee after this class you will understand all you didn't understand before. Gives a lot of homework  but you don't have to turn it in. However  it helps a lot to do homework. Take her if you want to know math
5,She is good Professor! Give a lot of homework  but you will understand everything
5,She is the best professor I had to finally help me understand math. I love her teaching style. she doesn't just tell you how to do the problem but explains why something is for what it is. the thing with math is there are sometimes more than one way to do a problem but she tells you her way and explains it well.
5,Shes a great and very professional person. Within 4 days i was able to complete all my questions and most important part of her teaching is that she is taking her time to explain and wants every one to understand before she'll move on to the next problem. I would highly recommend her . Shes very pleasant . Thanks prof.
5,She knows how to teach the Math and you will never leave her class with questions on clarity  gives Homework everyday but its only to benefit you! took her spring 13 and I learnt a lot in her class  you wont get a better education than what she can offer her students and she cares and will always help with any subject matter you may need !
4.5,BEST math professor EVER!!! I took her for math 9 and totally changed my whole perspective on math. She gives homework everyday and goes over it the next day in class. She is very patient and explains everything crystal clear. She makes math fun. I would take any of her over and over. She gives two exams and the final.
5,I took her Math express one week class  so things were rushed through. But she's an excellent  patient  and thorough educator who clearly enjoys math.
5,She's very clear and very helpful. There is no way that you will get a bad grade  or a failing grade. She makes math fun.
5,Listen in class  it really helps!
5,All you got to do is do the hw and youll get a great grade! My whole class did well because we met up to do the hW it was well worth the work (yes I said work  you do have to do somthing for the grade :) )
3.5,I don't know where to start or end. Her class is definitely not fun  but she is very very clear. That's probably good  especially in math. If you are interested in a hardcore math class  take hers. She is the chair of the math and computer science department so she misses some days too because of meetings. Overall  I would rate her a b-. The rest i
2,She is the most boring teacher in the world . Especially in her two hour class. DO NOT take her class whatsoever!!! She looks like she is back from the dead!!!
1.5,Get outta the sixties you freak!
5,i recommend prof. yarmish. she was always there to help me if i needed extra help. shes available to answer your questions and she teaches in a clear articulate way. take her if you need math.
1,Whatever you do  do not take a class with her. Truly terrible woman  doesn't care one bit. Save yourself the pain and suffering  take another Prof.
1,She is there to make it harder on the poor students. Going to her class is like going to scary movie.
4,Go to lecture - take notes - study - you'll be fine. Unlike many professors  she has a heart  so talk to her if things aren't workin out so hot for you and she'll work with you.
5,Dr. W has HIGH expectations  but that will make us successful when we get out of PSBvr. When the student puts forth effort  she will go out of her way to help- even outside of class. She cares about her students- but gets frustrated when people don't fulfill their potential. When she came here the dept was in CHAOS- she saved it! My favorite prof!
5,A very hard class  but an awesome teacher. All the people that say she doesn't teach well are just too lazy to apply concepts. She doesn't want you to memorize
5,Dr. Wroble is the best professor I've ever had. Yes  the work she assigns is very hard and very challenging  but a psych degree is not going to be handed to you on a silver platter. You have to work for it. I'm sure the bad ratings are from students that expect to have A's handed to them.
1,a heinous person so negative for someone in the field of psychology. I would not recommend taking any of her classes or going to this school for this degree.
4,hard hard hard...but fair. needs to loosen up some as she is very rigid. not real personable  but good as a teacher with a genuine interest in wanting us to succeed
3.5,No Comments
5,She was very interesting with her stories  which kept me awake for that hour. I learned the most from her than any other professor. She wasnt the easiest of professors to follow because you actually had to go to class to get the information  but she did her job.
1,I was going to become a psychologist until after taking her classes. By the end of the class  I would have got an A on what her life was about  her family  and her trips to London. It's a waste of time trying to learn about the actual topic  cause she also goes on about herself!
1,She was the worst teacher i have ever had. she took something i loved and made me hate it. all she talks about is her kid and herself. we all had to teach ourselves the entire course. do not take her course.
1.5,Not a great teacher. Like to talk abou things over and over again. Repeats herself and will not make topics clear. Teaches poorly and teaches only what she wants to say not what we need to know.
4,This class is ridiculously hard. With that in mind  he tries to make it understandable. The accent makes class worth going to.. he's a fun guy. The homeworks and tests are completely brutal  though...
5,Great professor. He really cares about his class  and works very hard at adjusting it according to student feedback. Ignore comments about previous years  because it's changed since them. It's not an easy class  but he's devoted to helping you understand the material.
3,Amazing Professor. Entertaining and really loves the material. Difficult class but rewarding.
3.5,Class was kinda tough (higher level engineering math)  but he did pretty well teaching it...uses a lot of his own problems for homework  does some things that aren't in the book. Great guy  makes jokes all class
3,Lectures are a waste. read from book.
3,Crikey! You've got a carrot in a microwave!
4.5,Enthusiastic  helpful encouraging  tough but fair
3.5,My only advise is to do the example problems and tests. He takes the test questions directly from them.
3,Lectures are BORING and so hard to follow. But it is just all math  so its hard to blame him for that. Book is very helpful. I pulled an allnighter the nite before second test  just reading the book and got almost 100% without ever paying attentionin clas
3.5,It's really great when he makes a mistake on the board and corrects it 5 minutes later but doesn't propogate that correction through everything else but in general thermo is really really hard so it's tough to blame him
3,Read the book. Lectures were mostly a waste.
1.5,Avoid him if you can  but if you do take it from him  be sure to read the book  it is a good way to learn the material. Much better than lecture.
3,Lectures can be confusing because he doesnt explain his derivations very well. Youll need the book to explain some things. Tests are kinda tricky.
1,Crazy Brit
2.5,hard class  busted my balls all semester

1,One of the worst professors I have ever encountered. Stay as far away as possible.?
1,Very rude
5,Great professor. If I was majoring in astro physics I'd definitely take more of his courses. Good teacher and takes the time to help you  but he is pretty busy. I went to every class and tried. It was a small class and for those of us that tried  I think we all did pretty well. I'd recommend him to anyone.
2,Nice guy  but I took an astronomy course for Arts students... Expected us to know all these complicated physics related things. I suppose it would have been fine  but I was more interested in looking at stars than learning the equations for the doppler effect and stuff.
5,Only had him for a lab instructor  but I wish I could take his course again. Extremely friendly  and explained things clearly. Attended a public lecture he gave as well  which was awesome. He knows his stuff  knows how to teach it  and is helpful and nice while doing so. Need more profs like him.
5,"GREAT!!!. Excellent pictures  Good use of pointers(lazers)  Always willing to answer questions He says no to copy his note off the board  **whisper** ""Copy everything  is helpful with assignments and keep you paying attention"". The midterm and finals were fair.. you don't study then you fail. Great first year proff"
4.5,Great guy and knows his stuff. He clearly defines and shows everything either on his projector or the board. Really good at explaining things. Keep on top of work or oit will overwhelm you!
4,Great guy - he's very clear and knows what he's talking about. The tests were very straight foreward  as were the assignments  and his odd expressions and variety of coloured markers help keep your attention if you're starting to drift. Keep on top of the work  otherwise it will seem harder than it is
3.5,He's an all right teacher. His diagrams are really helpful and if you have a question he does his best to answer it. The only problem is that he doesn't give out any handouts. He expects you to read the entire textbook.
3,These comments accurately describe the class. She does scream at the top of her lungs often  which is annoying considering my class starts at 830 am. She goes off topic way to often  talking about things that have no relevance to the class. Today we were supposed to review for the test  but we ran out of time and weren't able to.
5,I had Queen B. last spring. We still chat and she is EXTREMELY helpful with career advice  even after you complete her class. Definitely worth taking speech class even if you don't need it!
5,Fun teacher. Just study for her two tests and take all her advice for your speeches.
5,Ms. Berasi was a very excellent teacher. I brought in a dog for one of my speeches on teen depression. She allows students to think with an open mind  and I loved that! Overall  you'll have to do three speeches and bring in a poster board for each one. It was not a hard class  but time consuming!
2.5,She deffinately has her favorites and makes that clear. I've seen people do terrible on speeches and still get better grades then me  just depends on what mood shes in. You'll spend the whole class pleasing to her wants and not actually learning. The class is passable  you just gota put up with her ranting and insanity.
3,She's been teaching for years & she's excellent at it. She cares about her students. You will have to do 3 speeches. If you pick topics that are compelling that no one else in the class would even think about doing then you will pass her class with a good grade. It's not easy A though  you will have to work for it!
2,It is an easy class however  she has her obvious favorites. You could do an incredible job on your speech but if she doesn't like you or your topic  you will get a C. Just be very politically correct and you will do fine.
2,She screamed at the top of her lungs at my class on a regular basis. It doesn't matter if you have a great speech unless you do absolutely everything her way and she has her obvious favorites.
5,Her class is a lot of fun. Work hard and you will get a good grade.
5,Her class is a lot of fun. Just follow her lead  have a good attitude  and put forth good effort. Students from years gone by stay in touch with her. She will go outnof her way to help you.
4,She is easy if she likes you and you WILL know if she likes you. BE OUTGOING and FUNNY and you'll do well. She really gives like  110% if you are funny and bring props out of your ass. If she doesn't like you  you will get C's... Its that simple.
2.5,If she likes you and your topic you will get a good grade on your presentation. If she isn't interested in your topic she will pick apart your presentation. You can put all your time into your speech and if she doesn't like you won't do well. Very biased teacher and isn't objective in grading.
5,First test all definitions. Second test make up stuff. The rest of the course pretty easy  just be outgoing and fun and you'll get an A.
3,Very bouncy annoying and very demanding.I only lasted one day.For each speech the student has to decorate a table a poster and dress the part.It can get expensive.She called to see why I wasn't in class and yelled and lectured me when I told her I dropped it.
3.5,She was nice  but way to bouncy for me. Everything had to be done her way exactly. She should realize there are different styles.
5,Very nice! Funny and very helpful. She is one of those teachers who is willing to help you all the time. She is very nice.
3,Goes on pointless tangents a lot - tends to talk about himself more than about what we should actually be learning. Read the textbook if you want to pass  grades fairly but you need to put work into it in order to pass.
3,He is an okay professor  he knows what he is talking about but he is pretty difficult. He grades speeches on the harsher side. It is not really easy for many people to speak in front of others and I feel like he forgets that. He always uses the way he speaks as an example but has been doing it for so long hes a pro while were still adjusting to it
4,Olay is a professor that makes you work for the grade you want. There are 3/4 presentations and the last one is a group presentation. He grades outlines hard. As long as you come to class you'll pass. Textbook is only used for exam and final.
4,Professor Olaye gives several projects throughout the semester. They are all public speaking presentations about different topics. All require an outline and PPT. Tests aren't too difficult. They're based off the textbook  which is super easy to read and understand. Put in the effort  listen to feedback  study  and you're all set. Great professor!
2,hes a really smart guy no doubt about it but hes almost to smart to teach he looks at you like how do you not understand this? If you can take a different teacher but if you cant just prep yourself and never answers emails almost forgot
1.5,He can be every unclear. You wont get stuff back right away. If you need help DON'T EMAIL HIM  speak to him after class. He says that attendance in mandatory but he sometimes forgets to even take it. He really didn't know our names even at the end.
1,Absolutely terrible teacher does not care about your grade or you. He will never give back grades and will not follow what he wrote on the syllabus. His powerpoint slides have nothing to do with the class and he will not prepare you for the tests. If you don't have the book your screwed because your basically teaching yourself. DO NOT TAKE
5,Pushed me to do better. One of my favorite teachers.
4.5,Loved him! Unfortunately I only had him for one class. I tried to take another with him before graduating  but couldn't find a class that fit.
5,I believe that Olaye is an amazing professor. People just don't like him because he is tough and doesn't mess around. He makes you work and earn your grade. If you want an Ivy Leauge Education at a State School. Take Olaye.
1.5,A lot of people complain about Prof. Olaye but I've had him for two classes so far and he's really not that bad. He really challenges you to work hard and I definitely believe I've come out of his classes learning more than I would have if I had taken the class with someone else. Only complaint is that he can be extremely unclear with assignments.
5,I graduated from WPU in 04- Thinking about going to grad school at WPU to get my masters because of professors like Dr.Olaye. He makes you work and think and the outcome is growth. A lot of people would like to go through the motions of college and not get anything out of it besides a degree.Get value out of all this money we spend and take olaye!
1,By far the worst professor I've ever had. This class was intolerable. I found him obnoxious  rude  and useless. He has us for almost 3 hours  maybe 10 minutes of class is relevant. Waste of time  waste of space  avoid like the plague. I hated everyone in the class too. complete idiots.
2,i have 2 classes with him and in both of my classes we have tagged him as bipolar. One minute he wants to help  the next it's a different story. The test are absolutely ridiculous. They are always a 100 questions and hardly anyone passes. Good luck
4,Olaye has a moderately strong accent. You may find him hard to understand at times  but most students adjusted very quickly. He is enthusiastic and knowledgeable though sometimes a little ditzy. It is easy to get a good drage if you do some work. I chose not to do too much work  so I got a fair grade. I could have easily done better.
4.5,I was scared to take him...but I really love this class from day one. He loves to help his students. He wants you to be able to think. He has a lot of knowledge and is willing to share it with those students who want to get something from out of his class. I would take him again  for sure.
3,Great class very interesting lecture. Tardiness is ok cause he always arrives late. I got a B+ Took his class in the summer as well. Test are hard but if you just read the chapters  write your papers you will be fine. NOTE-USE POWER POINT for extra points!!!!
4,very nice guy but doent teach!! gets off the subject very easily....test are fairly hard  read the book!! as long as u try he'll pass u
4.5,I took the Dr. in a short summer class  scared out of my mind of Public Speaking. I ended up learning a lot from him and learned a lot. He is a really cool  interesting guy. He won't tolerate any BS  and can tell when someone is making an effort or not. If you try and show potential he will notice. I look forward to another of his classes.
4.5,Olaye is awesome
5,Kaci is easily my favorite teacher I had at Valencia. I took Illustrator with her several semesters ago and the more teachers I have had the more I like her. She was thorough  she new how to push my design without being pushy. She made class interesting and fun. I honestly think she is the greatest teacher I had at Valencia. Perfectly Balanced!!!!!
5,Fabulous Teacher!!! Very helpful teacher will explain everything makes it clear  teaches illustrator very well shows you a tons of different ways to do things and to learn things. FAB-taculous teacher!
5,Best teacher I ever had. Sad to see she wasn't teaching this semester.
5,Excellent teacher!! Always willing to answers your questions. I would recommend her to any students interested in Graphic Design. She is able to relate real world experience to us.
5,Amazing teacher. Very knowledgable about the industry. Put in the effort and you will get a good grade. Try and slide through without doing the work and you'll get the grade you deserve. The material can be hard but she has a great grasp on it.
5,I really liked Kaci. She taught pretty well and I felt like I got a good grasp of the subject. I really thought she was hot so maybe that had something to do with it. I could not take my attention off her.
2,"She acts like questions take up her time (WHY ARE YOU TEACHING?). She'll say something along the lines of ""Well  I'm right in the middle of something  but if it's fast..."" then laugh like you misunderstood her standoffishness and shes really"
4.5,Kaci is a great teacher. True  you dont have the time to complete projects out of class (all are done in class)  but she helps you and has no problems getting back to you with any questions.
3.5,She is a young teacher who is the daughter of the Director  Barbara Peterson.So she is usually told how to teach her classes by her mom.This way of learning Typography is very fast pace. Please take the other teacher for this class  you'll learn more.
4,Had Miller for biochem 2. It was more discussion based than lecture. It was bigger concepts than the niddy griddy stuff you learn in Biochem 1. Study and you will do fine. She's pretty fair in grading.
5,Best and most helpful professor I've had at Millersville. Would not recommend skipping any lectures. But she is very useful at office hours and responds to emails quickly. I think the tests are fair and she prepares you for them in lectures. Plus homeworks are very easy and are good grade boosters
3,This class sort of like what you learn in high school  and nothing like 111 is. Dr. Miller is not a bad prof at all  chemistry is just naturally difficult to understand if you don't study it a lot. Homework was easy points but the tests were at the challenging level that they should be. They just need to stop making this class 8AM.
5,Amazing professor! She always had extra study sessions before exams and even before our final. The homework was pretty easy  all online and you could do it until you had 100% on it.
4,Dr. Miller is awesome! I hated chemistry in high school and after taking her class I don't hate Chem (as much). She is so nice and willing to help if you ask her! Definitely take her if u need Chem 103. The class wasn't that hard. Just make sure you stay on top of the work. Homework on D2l is due every week and test are frequent  not too hard.
4.5,She is really willing to work with anybody to get the grade that you want. She is the most understanding prof I have ever met. She will do anything you need to succeed in her class. Such a nice and kind human being.
3.5,This class is pretty easy if you try. For the tests if you know everything on the study guide she gives you then you will do well. Tests are not scantron but she gives half credit if you try to answer the questions.
4.5,BEST PROFESSOR EVER! She definitely expects you to work for your grade. Do the readings  do the homework  go to labs and class. Basically  be a responsible adult like you're supposed to be at this age. That's all there is to it. Go to her office hours. She will go above and beyond to help if you show the initiative. A+++++!!!
4,Dr. Miller is awesome  but her class is pretty hard. You won't understand all of the material from just the lectures/hw because it's so difficult. It's worth taking a half hour every other night to read the book - it's what I did and I came out with a B. Also  take advantage of her office hours. She explains things better 1 on 1.
3,Chemistry is a difficult subject especially for those who have no interest in learning chemistry and are required to take the class. You have to study and put in a lot of work outside of class  simple as that. This is not a class that you attend lecture  review notes before exam and pull off an A or even a B. Not happening. STUDY! Nice lady.
2.5,Homework is like 2+2 and the tests are like trying to put together a spaceship with a toothbrush and silly string. Good 1 on 1 but horrible in class lectures. Can't teach to save her life. She is helpful when you ask but you shouldn't have to ask 1000 questions.
1.5,Nice professor who helps when you ask. But shes confusing. notes don't correlate to the very tough exams. homework questions also don't correlate on exams. exams are tough. tough tough tough
2,Very difficult to understand notes. Concepts are not explained in simple terms. Seems like she thinks we are already supposed to be chemists or something.
1.5,Tests are NOTHING like the practice problems. Homework does not correlate with tests in the slightest bit. Notes don't make sense. Labs she is helpful but that's it.
1,Tests are impossible. Help is scarce  homework has nothing to do with tests. The notes make no sense to reread. Gives extra test on finals week along with cumulative final.
2.5,Her tests are impossible. The class work and homework comes off as easy but the test are on a whole new level.
2,her notes don't make sense while studying. calculations on test are immensely harder than what she teaches in class. has trouble explaining things. She's a kind woman who will try and help.
4.5,Prof. Miller is probably one of the best professors I've had in college. She's incredibly nice  helps you when you need it  and isn't too serious about her class. Her lectures are pretty helpful and you can tell she genuinely cares that her students understand her material. Definitely take her if you can
4.5,Dr. Miller is the best. She makes Chem so understandable for non-chem majors. Her office door is always open if you need help but for the most part  her lectures are easy to follow and the homework really helps prep for tests. Also  effort does not go unnoticed in her class  even if it is a large class! Take her if you can!
5,Hands down one of the nicest professors I've had so far. She is extremely helpful and is always willing to go over the material if you were to ever have a question. She even helps you out with the homework. Study the book and the notes and do the hw and you should be fine.
5,He genuinely cares for his students and is understanding. The work is hard but not overwhelming. His grading is not too strict  which is good.
4.5,Definitely a great professor. I'd graduated 10 years ago and still remember Mr. James Muckell as one of the best people I've ever met. He made everyone feel as their family  in fact he was like a dad to me. Those who try to tarnish his name should be ashamed. I'll pray for you guys.
5,Great Prof. Very rare
4.5,great teacher!!
4.5,great teacher. hard class
5,Good  honest teacher
5,Prof Muckell is an amazing professor. Those who say his is a hypocrite or his life is a lie need to see the real world and get their bubble popped. His work is challenging but you will learn if you do the work.
4.5,Great professor
5,A good prof but a bit of a hypocrite  not sure why he is at Nyack...
4,A very good professor  but his life is a lie...
5,MR. Muckell rocks at being a Yank and at all other faacets of life. Anyone who can raise 17 children at once is ok in my book
4.5,The Best Professor I have had by far. He will definitely help you and give you a chance to do well. He is available for help and more than willing to meet half way. One of the best accounting professors including on a prestigious university level!
5,Muckell is the absolute best. Nyack should be lucky to have him. He is honestly the only reason i ever even stayed at Nyack. The school has so many problems and is so messed up it needs more people like Muckell.
5,one of the best professors in business. also a real accountant. and makes it impossible to fail.
5,Amazing professor! He's so down to Earth and he will stop at nothing to help you learn.

4.5,hes one of those professors that people either hate or love. if youre good at math and hard working then youll do fine. if youre lazy and kinda bad at math dont take him! also math homework is online and its terrible. probably the only really bad thing. but hes super nice and extends homework all the time. curves at end based on overall class grade
2,super sweetheart  but doesnt teach very clear. you need to do the hw to understand whats going on. hw is worth points anyways  so just pay attention when you do it. i tried  but not my absolute best and i got a B.throughout the whole sememester our grades were curved. i would for sure take him again. HE'S A SWEETHEART!
2,he over explains stuff to the point were even the smart students get confused he also does his math wrong sometimes and does not realize it unless you bring it up. Do not recommend! unless you like to argue with your professor or you are good at math. I got the highest grade in my class only because i taught myself
4.5,He is a great professor. Always willing to help. Not a set curve  just curved based on how everyone does on the exams. Always reviews homework and always extended homework. Always willing to help. Can be confusing at times  but i would take him again
4.5,I loved his class. I learned lots of new material. Just study hard and practice and you'll do fine.
5,He's incredibly sweet. One of the best teachers at CSUN. He is very helpful and knowledgeable. Keeps the class fun and interesting. I enjoyed Calculus because of him! Take him for sure!!!!
5,Best Geo teacher! helps you in his office well if you have any questions. He's really nice too. If you do all the homework and understand  you shouldn't have any problems with the tests. I never really took notes in class and did well on the tests.
3,He knows his material  but isn't helpful.
4.5,Not the most organized teacher but the class is not too difficult. He rarely collected homework and he always gave out study guides for the tests. 3 tests and 5 geometry software assignments. Go to class and you'll do fine.
2,This was a stupid class! you will not learn anything because he doesn't teach and he expects you to teach your classmates. he assigns hw  but never collects it. We only went over 1/2 of the chapters we needed to know for a department final!!! I'd learn more never going to this class!
5,Very helpful and knowledgable teacher. Assignments are assigned every class meeting  but not all are collected. If you pay attention in class you will be able to do the hw. Highly recommended.
5,Dr.Zeitlan is such a great teacher everything that everybody wrote about him is true and then some.He is such a caring person and really wants you to do well.I was very lucky to have him as my 311 math teacher.If you have any questions he will be more than happy to answer them.He always makes time for his students. Definately take him if you can.
5,He is awesome. ALEKS is obnxious but all Math310s have to do it. He gives quiz outlines  explains everything  is clear....it's a very simple subject as well - especially if you're into Math. He is flexible and approachable. He didn't make any students feel dumb like I would have....EASY A.
3.5,This prof. is not that bad but the ALEKS and comp assignments is what kills u. The thing i didn't like about this prof was how he allowed everyone to get up and try to explain the subject and he just sat there.Oh yeah  if he knows your name he will pick on you.If ur the type of person that doen't like doing HW i wouldn't recommend him.
5,Awesome teacher. Really knows his geometry. Very clear. Explains very well   and has always helped me even when I wasn't his student.
4.5,He's an awesome teacher  but it takes a while to understand how he teaches.. Do your h/w and ask questions and you'll do fine... but most importantly  study for the final... it's totally different!!!!
5,He is a really good human being. Very caring to his students. Tests were not that hard.

5,She's very sexy in her own unique way. I'd love to date her.
5,Very Hot!!!
4.5,A great class. She makes law interesting with real-world examples.

1.5,She falsely accused me of collaborating on my final exam(im a good student& would never)called me & hung up on me when i told her i spoke with the dean. Later she never contacted me  letting me know that i was found innocent. i had to find out when i recieved my grades that i  in fact  had a grade in her class. Thank God she is leavin
1.5,The socialist finally got the axe!!!! Hurray!
1,DO NOT TAKE ANY OF HER CLASSES UNDER ANY CONDITIONS!!
1,"This ***** takes first prize on the award of ""worst teahcher ever"". No joke  she is rude and very arrogant. She never makes herself available and shows no sympathy what so ever. I really believe she likes failing people and gets a kick out of it. You might as well transfer b4 taking her class :o(..."
1,she is a horrible woman  seriously gets off on failing kids.. whatever you do  do not take her classes... you'll regret it
1,"when i asked if she wanted opinions  facts  or both for a paper she said (and i quote) ""i NEVER want your opinion"" The 60s were all about voicing your opinion! meanest  most unhelpful teacher i've ever had. do not take her classes at any cost"
1,this teacher wont like u if ur not her race or her sexual orientation... if u r white male and straight u wull fail...this teacher made we completly want to change my major..if you are going to take the american expirience take it with swanson...smith worse teacher ever
4,Dr. Smith I agree is very intimidating woman at first but I think she is a fair lady. I learned a lot from this class and would recommended to people who aren't so shy.
1,Dale  why so angry? And at who? As someone who would like to engage in a great discussion of these important issues  her negativity and anger keep that from happening.
1,Awful teacher. You could learn more watching the History Channel. She is rude and if you are not on her good side you are done for. She is **** and arrogant. Not helpfull and is never in her office during office hours. Her grading is also very questionable.
1,She is not helpful  and she did not lift my hold so I could register for my classes.
1,This teacher is one of the worst that i have ever had. She refuses to give the time of day to any students never mind to help them. She is a huge ****  and a pompous self absorbed ****...I wouldnt suggest crossing her path never mind taking a class with her.
1.5,This is the worst teacher I have ever had. She has not gave me a passing grade on a single paper!! I once asked her to proof read my paper (which was not a bad paper at all) and she LAUGHED in my face. Extremly rude and always puts you down.
1,Smith is egocentric  pompous  ill- mannered and scrupuless. She is prejudice towards anyone not of her race. She is not a valuable teacher to this university and her teachings should be evaluated. By the way I am a Dean's list student.
1,"""you clearly have no understanding of the american experience"" - F 0 points .... a direct quote from a paper  i am a deans list student never have i gotten lower then an A- on a paper. Rude  arrogant  angry...all words to describe i her."
1.5,She lectures all through the class..very boring  and is a tough grader...not very approachable
1,Not helpful  not nice  rude  not good.
3.5,if she likes you  it is a good thing  if she doesnt you are in for it.. i have learned alot from her but she is very intimidating
1,SOOOOO happy that he got fired!!!!!
1,Wow he sucks in many ways.....
2.5,The man is an idiot. I got an A though  so I'm not complaining.
1,Easiest class in the world  but not great for people that LIKE theatre.
4,I got an A in his class so I got no complaints.
1.5,this man is insane! he makes the class harder each semester! the only thing interesting at all were the movies we watched.. i went to class & paid attention & ended up with a C.. he's also very unprofessional & makes fun of students
2,i think the main problem was his tests on blackboard. they were difficult because half the things that were on the test we had never gone over. i didnt like that he made fun of the students and said racial comments. one thing tho  if i emailed him with a question  his response was always helpful.
1,his quizzes were rediculous and he was just really mean and racial to all the students!
3,ok  the only negative in his class is the hard quizes on blackboard. Some of the questions you have to just figure out for yourself. he is really into theatre and wants people to appreciate it  we watch alot of movies and there is no attendance policy  just dont sleep or walk out while he lectures
2.5,This man is out of his mind. Have the stuff that is on the quizes he never talks about. He is crazy. He also has a reverse camel toe. If you dont know what that is just think about it and picture it in your head. If you take this class just dont go and you will still do fine.
4,This class was easy! All of the quizes are on blackboard  along with all of the class notes. Ok  the quizes are hard  but he has very clear notes. He also offers huge amounts of extra credit - the only way to fail is to not show up  not give a****  and not do your work...
1,He knows what he is talking about he just doesn't get the point across to people. The quizzes he gives are super hard. I have been to every class and always taken notes and I only have a C! Don't take if you think it will just up ur GPA!
2.5,He changed the class since last year and it's almost impossible to get an A in there. I have attended all the of lectures  print the notes off blackboard and take notes and I still fail all of the quizzes. Everyone I know in the calss is failing right now
1,He's a idot!!!
4,give the guy a lil credits  he gets the basics of theater across in a fun and effective way. NOT TO MENTION EASY.... stop whining... or transfer into Van Ness's class so you can have somethin to whine about
1,He is soo freaking stupid! He has this laugh that made me cringe! Nobody comes to class and it is a good class to have if your schedule is demanding. He has no attendance policy  but good luck if you need help outside of class- you won't get it.
5,I like him. I think he is really nice and very passionate about theatre. He derserves a little more respect than that.
3,All of his class in on blackboard and he shows an inappropriate amount of movies for a college course.
5,He was really nice in general. Yes  he did wear the same short shorts over and over again but he has a wife and kids so he isn't that fruity. Get to know him he is very nice. He let me take the final two weeks late when I had the flu.
1.5,easy class  take it! bujt actually going to class is another story. puts all notes online and no attendence if you read the plays you will be fine. but CLASS IS NAPTIME!
3,Josh really loves talkig about weather and gets excited but he isn't great at communicating that info to his students. Really lenient with accepting late assignments.
1,OMG- Do not take his class  he is a horrible teacher. If you trip over the cord to his projector  he will whine and cry. then he will send you up for disciplinary sanctans and have you put on probationary standards. He will piss and moan about the most rediculus stuff. Stay away from him  he will ruin your college career.
2,He knows a lot about what he teaches  however  telling others of what he knows isnt a strong point of his. each class there is (at least) one quiz. they are worth 100 points each and 10 questions. although there are so many  if you get 4 questions wrong your already at 60%. He drops the 2 lowest grades  but in the long run  it doesnt help.
4,lOVE THIS GUY!!!
3.5,Nice guy  loves weather... gets very excited about it. not a bad teacher at all.
1.5,He needs to learn how to teach. He knows alot about his field  but has no skill of teaching. There are only 8 students in the class and he couldn't remember all of our names. He should go back to school and learn how to teach
1,He is incredibly boring. We cannot pay attention in class because he can't keep it. We spend most of our time making fun of his receding hairline.
5,A lot of passion for his topic
1,Only got the job because he's married to Sra. Budd and it shows!!! Doesn't care about the success of his students. Total nightmare just like his wife!
1,I didn't last long in this class. The man barely speaks English  therefore  he has issues answering any questions in class. He is rude and is very blunt with his feelings on the overall class grade. Whatever you do  AVOID this class unless Spanish is your primary language.
2.5,WHAT THE HECK IS HE SAYING!!!!!!
4,this guy is gravy u suck if u think other wise just talk to him hes a nice guy hell help u out on test better that gray that ****bag
1,"All he does is reads to us from the text book. I can do that in my room. And he always says ""I think you know "" when in reality  I don't know. The class is extremely boring and he doesn't need to be teaching it."
2.5,i understand his spanish better than his english. very easy. not a lot of hw.
2,I swear this man doesnt know any english. He also doesnt answer questions you ask. He also doesnt get back to emails you send him. He is really nice but very confusing. Good Luck if you try taking it with him.
1,Failed the class cause i couldn't ever figure out what he wanted.
3,He is a sincerely nice man  but that is his main problem. He is too nice and goes over material too slowly. I get bored out of my mind and I probably won't be properly prepared to take SPAN 202. But his class is easy. Not a lot of homework.
4,really sweet old guy  a little confused cuz his english isn't great  but he helps you on tests and if you're nice to him he's really nice to you
5,Great professor. I'd spend sometimes up to half an hour after class badgering her and she'd answer and discuss every question whole-heartedly.
5,good prof
4.5,No Comments
4.5,Mr. Levine is old school  and also the man. He's super smart and not afraid to tell things like they are.
5,I agree w. most of the raters-Levine's an old school liberal  a wonderful man  and one of the most thoughtful professors I've come across at Bowdoin. Lectures can drag sometimes  but he's truly interested in his students' thoughts and is never a mean or spiteful grader. Take a class with him.
5,I have had him for two courses and they were both a pleasure. I can't understand some of these other comments. While he is an unabashed liberal  he is still a fair grader and will not punish you for thinking differently. Lectures sometimes boring
2,Awful. Worst experience in college career
4,Dan Levine is a super nice guy. He is very liberal  but always fosters debate. He is available if you go look for him. I can not understand certain students personal criticism of him.
3.5,Okay  he's just an eccentric guy. His grading is kind of random  but he is quite fair. Difficult to find outside of class. Old-school liberal who reveres Truman. He's not intimidating about it though...just proud. No overbearing ideological demagoguery.
4,Levine is old school. He's politically liberal  but not in an obnoxious self-righteous sociology/women's studies type way. He just loves FDR. His grading is sometimes completely random  but I enjoyed the classes I took with him and learned a lot.
1,Professor Levine is one of the worst teachers I have ever had. He is a mean grader  a boring lecturer  and an ultra-lib. He gives very few comments on papers and is very hard to find outside of class.I wish I had never taken a class with him.
5,Never noticed him goad or insult anyone. Very kind. Ultra-liberal. Comments on papers are helpful  but not exhaustive. His lectures are slow but informative because he pauses to think about what he is going to say. Friendly in and outside of class.
1,Goads students in class  makes personal insults to better his ego. Is a tough grader  and gives little reason behind his paper grading. Has been at Bowdoin too long  and needs to go to where he is deserved... Colby.
4,Enjoyed the class subjects but found some of the lectures tedious. He obviously knows his stuff and discussion groups aren't too bad.
3.5,Lectures can be very tedious. Not bad  not great.
5,Great teacher  interested in his students and willing to take time to help.
5,incredible teacher and unbelievable researcher...he has great insights!
5,Great  kind  and caring professor.
1,She is mainly interested in male students and seems to flirt and make advances at men.
1,Notes were online  but incredibly disorganized and impossible to read. Homework took HOURS with unclear directions. We spent weeks going over something that wasn't tested. The midterm  final  and homework were all different. She made her TA review the final during class time even though the TA hadn't seen the final yet. Could go on and on. AVOID!!
5,I took the Summer 2012 field camp at the grad level taught by Dr. L. She was an excellent instructor who was very organized and knew what she was talking about. Never having attended NIU before  Dr. L was very accommodating  especially when I had trouble paying off my NIU field camp fees and turning in my final essay for the class
4.5,In summer 2012  I took NIU's environmental field geology course. Not having gone to NIU before  I found the teaching style here dynamic and very hands on. Melissa is an excellent instructor and is very knowledgeable in her field. I recommend her field camp to any environmental science majors from any university.
1,She was unless on what she taught. Her tests were on things we NEVER learned. I liked the class  just not her.
5,Dr. Lenczewski is one of my favorite professors. She gives power point lectures in class that are fun and very easy to understand. 3 exams with an optional final. Online quizes which are easy grade boosters and watch a lot of movies with easy reviews as well. She keeps class super interesting and has lots of extra credit opportunities.
3.5,She has interesting lectures on the topics espcially on water. Had us reading a couple of books outside of class that changed my mind about water in Florida. I would recommend her for future courses.
1,DID NOT LIKE her section of the class. Her portions of the tests were much harder and she does not upload feedback for assignments as the other instructor for this class did. Overall a very poor quality teacher!
4,Interesting class with great examples of what we are doing to the environment. The stories are great. Challenging but doable. I would highly recommend this course to anybody interested in the saving the world.
1,"This Professor is you advisor (unfortunately) for env. majors and she is no exception in the ""I am useless"" bandwagon. Thats right  her lectures and exams are total different ball games  so dont expect anything better by attending her class regularly. She is a plain ""I dont make sense"" professor. Avoid her. NIU has the worst geology dept."
1,Do not let this smiley faces fool you  this teacher is your advisor in Geol env-geo science major  and she is not exception in the bandwagon of horrible teachers. Her powepoint notes and exams are completely different story. Do yourself a favor  DO NOT TAKE GEOL AT NIU  THIS TEACHER WILL MAKE U FEEL SORRY
5,that was 1 easy class  and she is definitely a fun person and a good teacher - perhaps not perfectly organized... It would have been even more fun if the majority of the class hadn't been such idiots not paying attention  not doing homework or reading the book and then whining about their grade! this is college and it's time to grow up!
3,kinda boring class...her lectures are pretty dry and uninteresting. her tests are harder than they should be...somewhat easy to get a B...hard to get an A. not one of the better professors at NIU.
3.5,i think she may have changed her course bc u need the book now to do some of her hw. class isn't easy A and you HAVE to go to get the notes and attendance points. shes an ok teacher but subject is really boring and dry. tests are kinda hard...probably an easy B but def not A unless you know this subject well.
5,Really easy class- I got a 97 overall. Don't even buy the book. I never opened it. Make sure u go to class cuz u get quizzes and homework assignments that r not on blackboard. Those really enhance your grade. Easy class and she is a good  fun teacher.
5,easy class if you go to classes. tests not too bad
5,excellent professor. DONT buy the book  you will never open it. powerpoints on blackboard  show up to class and you will for sure get at least a b. she really knows her stuff and is very enthusiastic about it.
5,Class is easy  usually relatively easy  and ALWAYS ends early. Tests are not bad  just show to class and you will cruise. She is also a nice woman who really knows her subjects. You for sure do NOT need to buy the book.
3,i dont like her as a professor. she favors students within the environmental facet of geology over the rest of us. you never get any tests or assignments back and are never given a rheubric to begin with. her powerpoints are boring and the required book is useless. i hated her half of 330.
5,Has really great enthusiasm. Isn't boring  and relates topics to your own lives. Is always willing to help... The tests are pretty easy  and a lot of quizzes deal with just showing up to class. She also offers like 25 points of extra credit...which isn't really needed for people who show up.
5,It's obvious that Ian cares for his students & wants them to learn real world techniques that might save their lives someday. I'm much more confident in my ability to protect myself since taking this course. This was one of the very best classes I've taken as a college student. I highly recommend this course & this professor to everyone!
5,Mr. Kinder is an amazing teacher that cares about his students. This is not an easy A class and you will have to work to acheieve an A. I recommend Ian and his class to anyone looking to take a self defense class. FYI this is a very physical class so be prepared to sweat.
1,Worst teacher in the entire planet. You will not learn anything about self defense. He will keep pushing his business on students and will gladly fail you for no reason at all. This teacher will be more than happy to kill your GPA. If you come late once   he will close the door on you then it is an automatic C. Worst Worst teacher ever.
5,AMAZING! Best class I have taken at OCC. Mr. Kinder is helpful and wants to teach you how to protect yourself! I have learned so much  and had to use it once and it saved me from getting hurt. The class is fun and filled which physical activity. Attend class and practice the moves and you will pass. Good Luck!
5,Great class  amazing teacher. Loved it!
5,Ian Kinder is a great professor! His teaching methods are accurate and helps you in the long run. This class will prepare you to defend yourself in various ways. You will have fun in this class for sure!
1,You get yelled at if you don't follow his order. He's suppose to help you  not make you feel little. It's self defense not a military class. All I can say is don't take it with him.
4.5,Best class I've taken at OCC. If you want to a great workout and the opportunity to learn to defend yourself  this is the class for you. I've learned so much and my confidence has grown by leaps and bounds. Ian has great leadership skills. He's confident  precise  tough as nails  yet provides awesome instruction so that you can truly learn Self Def
4,I loved this class. I really learned a lot. I recommend this class to others. It helped me overcome a lot of hears I had. He explains things well. I hope to take additional classes with him too.
1.5,All I can say is Don't take this class. If you want to learn self defense go to a real school not some 8 week class where you are going to be abused physically and verbally. Oh and the teacher expects you to do his job and teach your peers. Not work with them but teach them. If you don't do that you get yelled at.
3.5,He takes his job and class seriously so he doesn't joke or waste time. For the final you literally get attacked by him (tackled  slapped  hair pulled  choked)But he really wants to prepare you and make you use the skills he taught you. Take it if you really want to learn to defend yourself but don't expect this to be an easy 1 credit class!!
3.5,Good teacher  yet intimidating. Don't miss any classes and you'll be good!
5,This was one of the best classes I've ever taken. Ian was very knowledgeable. The material that I learned could one day save my life. I think Ian is great teacher and I can't wait to take other classes with his school  Live Safe Academy.
5,I took Ian's self defense class about 3 years ago. I ended up taking his class a second time in additon to his CPL class. Ian is still a good friend today and a man that I am proud to have in my corner.
5,I absolutely loved the self defense class with mr.Ian.He is an amazing instructor and you learn valuable things in his class.
4,Great teacher. Expect to pay attention because he is really dedicated to teaching self defense so if you seem like you don?t want to be there he?ll notice. I think we had one test. Very hands on class. you'll never be sitting down
5,He is a very kind and hardworking teacher. He is very clear in his teaching and extremly helpful. As long as you follow the rules and work hard you will recieve an A in the class. His self defense class is very fun and is great exercize as well.
4.5,Good class! I'm a lazy person and that final exam really worked me out wew!
4.5,Mr. Kinder may come off as serious but I believe he wants you to be serious about your training and skills you learn. He is very knowledgable and I loved the class. So worth it for the cost!! Everyone should take self-defense. I would take it second time.
5,Took the self-defense class. Just gotta say: WOW! I never would have expected something this rigorous and thorough from OCC. Completely awesome course and teacher. The final: you use what you've learned to defend yourself against an 'attacker'! (or you can write a paper if you're scared like I was  lol) Definitely came out with knowledge!
5,Good guy and good teacher. Have to attend to pass. Some stupid rules he has but isn't that big of a deal. Don't necessarily have to pay attention  but have to read the book and do problems in workbook. Tests are very straight forward  some questions directly out of the work book. Very easy A.
5,awesome!! made lectures interesting and fun.. always got out of class early and offers lots of extra credit
1,Text for Stress Mgmt class unnecessary & waste of money  all covered in class. Dont see why the book is required. Spouting personal opinions & insulting medical documents is unprofessional. Makes inappropriate comments  creates uncomfortable environment. students arent allowed to leave class for bathroom  wont be allowed re entry...?
5,Show up for class do all your assignments and any extra credit that is offered. Make sure you study the power point presentation and the word definitions that are listed in the chapters. If you do those steps you will pass the class with no problem. Make sure you are on time for class. Once the door is close we will not be allowed in the class
5,By far one of my favorite professors. He can be a little strict with guidelines and rules but he is always willing to help  great at keeping the class attention  and teaches well. You can see that he loves what he does but he also takes it seriously.
5,Professor Martin really enjoys the subject of stress management. The techniques he taught in class really work and can help  they helped me a lot during Finals week. Do the extra credit and online homework nd study and you'll get an easy A.
5,He is the best Proffessor
1,This is the only class that was difficult for me to get through. He teaches well  but he has very strict rules and regulations. He also can be very rude and mean  anger like. He is not understanding  if you have a crisis  funeral  children etc he does not care. No homework  and test based course only. Hard to bring your grade up.
5,Bruce was wonderful. Not only did he teach me tons about meditation  stress management and prevention  he offered a wealth of other knowledge as well.
1,I didn't realize the course would include a mandatory MLM presentation by a snake oil salesman for a product based on inaccurate nutrition information from a veterinarian. He pitches his other classes all the time and tries to bribe you to take them by offering extra credit in this course. He treats adults like children  and don't be late!
2,Class is relatively easy  the book helps but its not needed. As for the professor  he's a hit or miss. If you're late 10 minutes to class you'll only receive some credit for attendance. You're graded on 5 tests  online homework assignments and attendance. The tests are only 25 questions each but worth 100 points each. He can be very unprofessional.
5,Amazing bowling instructor! I wasn't a good bowler & I made so many gutters  until I took Professor Martin. I never scored 3 digits my entire life  until I took his class. Now  I rarely hit the gutter. Spares & Strikes are easier to achieve because of him. You'll learn to keep score & he gives you the answers to the final exam on the first day :-)
1.5,Sorta Feel like his main goal is too make me fail  but he tricks you because he has a great personality but doesn't leave enough time to take notes.
5,i have had him for 2 classes now. He is great. Pay attention in his classes and show up since he gives points for attendence. I got a 4.0 both times ive taken him. Love him!
4,Great teacher.. Just listen and do your work
4,Mr. Martin is very passionate about his career and it shows. He does offer extra credit which is very helpful. During the semester  you take 5 tests and he drops the lowest grade. Very nice man  and I do recommend him  but please take it serious  he is there for you.
5,Loved his class! I just finished his class but I would take it all over. Very nice cool guy. Pretty easy class I recommend it!
5,Nice guy. You must attend every class bc there's always something relevant to learn each day. Need the textbook (I only used the workbook for the review or the final). 5 exams  1 practical (group) exam  lowest grade is dropped (can't drop the final). Lectures are boring. Lots of hands-on stuff. Lots of classmate interactions. Good class take!
5,LOVED this class! I recommend it to EVERYONE with this prof! He teaches things beyond the textbook and has helped me with life skills.
4,Easy. Seems like he always had some idea of making money off of us students. which i didnt appreciate. Easy class though. just show up on time  and take notes.
1,avoid his class under all circumstances.
2,If you will take his class it will be your nightmare semester. Course is very good to study but he studies like we have done Ph.D. and know all things. Lectures are sleepy. Homework is very tough as well exams. Don't take his class otherwise ready to ruin your semester and grades.
1,Avoid his class at any cost. He failed half of the class. Lectures are sleep provoking. Exams are tough. He doesn't care about his students. He assumes everybody has excellent knowledge in the subject. JUST DONT TAKE HIS CLASS.
3,Donxc3x82xc2xb4t take class woth him if you can. Is very hard  he tries to be very helpful but the examn is not like the homework so is hard.
4,Overall  I think he is a good professor and I would take him again. He tried to help people understand and would give bonus points on test to help keep average up. He was vague on how he was grading was going to be in the end. Most people did bad on project.
2.5,Failed a quarter of his class.
1,If you are a mechanical student- he is hard. If you are a different engineering taking it as a tech elective- don't. Very confusing  and does not explain things thoroughly at all. Book and he assumes extensive prior knowledge in mechanical engineering. He seemed liek he knew his stuff very well-but doesn't explain anything well enough
5,Very patient  will re-explain himself until he is sure you understand what he is trying to teach.
4,This guy's crazy classroom antics and enthusiasm for the subject by themselves make any class with him worth taking. He knows his stuff about mechanisms. He absolutely loves teaching this subject and it shows. He's also really lenient on homework grading. He can throw some curveballs on tests.
4.5,No Comments
1,The organization of her class is very hard to understand. She's a tough grader. The organization on her blackboard is tough to understand so make sure to double check everything to not miss an assignment. If you miss an assignment your grade will suffer badly. If you can avoid her class don't take her.
3.5,Dr. Iftode is great! If you ever need help she is more than willing to assist you. The assignments can get a little tough  but you'll certainly learn a lot from her if you're interested in the material!
3.5,I really liked professor Iftode. At first I was on the fence about her  but as time went on  she really grew on me. The class is a little challenging  but if you ask her questions  she will always talk you through your confusion. She's really sweet and a fairly easy grader. Participation definitely makes a difference too.
2.5,Good professor. Not very clear with what she wants so you may need to ask a few times to get the answer. Lots of papers  so you better like to write. You need to set aside at least an hour a night to get an A. It's possible  but tough.
1.5,I didn't take her for a class but I did attempt to be a part of her research. Had a meeting with her and she was completely rude. My freshman year I got a C in calc while working two jobs and being a full-time bio major. She wouldn't let the C go. I even told her I would quit my jobs to be more available  nothing. Wasted 45 mins in her office.
3,She is a terrible lecturer  but an easy grader. Read the textbook and do the practice problems she gives you before the exams. She is very understanding and will move dates around if you really need her to. She is a really nice lady and is always willing to help.
3,As long as you participate in class and ask lots of questions  you will do fine. I paid attention during class  followed instructions with regards to writing lab reports and asked a lot of questions and I got a solid A.
3.5,Okay so far I see that people are really harsh with comments. But to be honest  she isn't that bad. She doesn't do a good job at explaining  how ever she doesn't pile on the work and her test aren't impossible. Just read the textbook and she emphasizes doing end of chap questions which helped me. My biggest pet peeve was her blackboard.
1,Without the textbook i would have learned nothing. She does't teach you  she expects you to look everything up. She is a sweet lady  but not a good teacher at all. If you take her  use the textbook to study for tests...not the notes in class...i stopped taking notes cause they're worthless
2,This professor is very knowledgeable and if you pay attention and have a strong previous knowledge of biology and genetics the tests will be easy. Take good notes  pay close attention even if shes boring  you will be fine. Never once did I open the book though I'm sure that is a useful tool. Pay attention her class schedule is your best friend
3,Learned more from dog****.
1,Worst professor I ever had. She clearly needs to re-think her teaching methods  but she wont  because she is stubborn. Iftode  if you are reading this  consider your rating compared to other professors on this site  and re-think your teaching methods  because they don't work.
2,Not helpful. Tough grader on papers. Tests are impossible. Doesn't test your knowlede  if your good at bs-ing you will do decent on exams. If you contest her  she will put you down. Her best friend and your worst nightmare is blackboard.
1,Absolutely horrible professor and experience.
1,I don't recommend her to anyone. She isn't helpful at all when you have questions. Plus  she is very hard to understand.
1,Expects you to know material just because she posted it on Blackboard. Her teaching style consists of rambling in front of the class in a manor that is too difficult to take notes. She provides no review whatsoever for tests. She expects you to magically know what she wants. You will be forced to learn all material yourself. Tests are impossible.
1,"she missed half of the semester and expected us to continue on like nothing happened. no one  not even our subs knew what was going on and when you ask questions she tells you to ""check blackboard"" even if the question you cant be answered over the computer  its probably because she cant explain it to you. her blackboard is soooooooooo unorganized."
1.5,"Missed a large portion of our class  wouldn't be bad but didn't notify us twice and the other times had different substitutes. expected us to continue work (incl. labs) without missing a beat  and frequently told us ""just check blackboard"" when we'd ask her about assignments. Everything I learned from her I could have learned by reading wikipedia."
2,Iftode is a good teacher as long as you have some sort of background in genetics. If you have a solid background  I would recommend taking this class. If not  go elsewhere. Her blackboard is confusing and due dates are never really clear. She is really nice and when you ask her for help she is very helpful.
1,She's a nice lady and all  but seriously cannot teach for anything. She is bad at clarifying things  her blackboard is all jumbled up and confusing  and does not tell you what is due until the day of. if you want to be stressed out confused and bored  definitely take her class. I advise not taking the class.
5,Truley one of the best if not the best professor I've ever had. He's absolutely brilliant. No matter what he's teaching you  he will find a way to relate it to your every day life so that it makes sense. I recommend him to everyone.
5,Professor Patierno is easily one of the best professors I've ever had. He's helpful  kind  polite  and extremely knowledgeable. All of his tests are made up directly from his notes  so as long as you show up to class every day and study your notes  you'll get an A. I highly recommend taking one of his classes -- you'll have fun and learn a lot.
5,I had him my first year of college and he made it SO interesting. He is honestly a GREAT professor. He gives notes examples and answers your question no matter how dumb it may be. He gives 2 types of test. A vocab and notes and he drops the lowest test grade. Read the texbook and thats it. easy. i'd take his again if i could.
5,THE BEST PROFESSOR YOU WILL EVER HAVE IN EVERY WAY!!!! JUST DO ALL ASSIGNMENTS AND STUDY THE NOTES HE GIVES YOU FOR HIS MULTIPLE TESTS AND YOU WILL GET AN A.
5,This professor really knows how to conduct a online class! He is a AWSEOME professor who makes the subject very fun.
4.5,great professor  he gives all your work in advance  all his work is clear. only bad thing is he does not respond to emails and the exams are extremely confusing and hard.
5,Professor Patierno is an excellent teacher. He's incredibly kind and he teaches straightforward but interesting lectures. My advice to you is to make a friend in the class that takes good notes that you can photocopy  this way you can relax and soak up all the fascinating anthropological goodness....and yes  everything is multiple choice.
4,Very good teacher. He is very generous to those who took notes and studied the material. In my class  the lowest 'class average' was like 86.
5,He is a good professor. Just take notes  study the guides he gives and you will be fine.
5,ONE OF THE BEST PROFESSORS HERE @ BCC. Very nice man as well. He knows his stuff and makes it very interesting. He gives you pages to read(optional)but tests are MAINLY from his notes. Just Listen  Follow his Exam Guides  and Your notes and you'll do fine. Fair amount of Notes but as long as you have em  this class is a breeze.
4,You will learn alot from this man. Take his class. It will all be worth it. Barely any work. A few quizes and only 4 exams. The lowest exam grade is dropped. Over all he is awesome and cute!
5,he is so sweet and helpful. one of the best prof at bergen! he really cares about his students. not alot of work but study for tests.
5,I took this professor for an online class and it's quite simple if you are motivated. Log on twice a week to check when things are due and you'll do fine. Tests are simple and multiple choice
1,very boring teacher  tests are ok but you have to study a lot
5,Brilliant  sweet  helpful. Wants you to succeed and does everything in his power to make sure you do! awesome guy
5,Professor Patierno is very nice and easy to understand. Class is very easy & not a lot of work. As long as you participate in discussions & study his notes (not the textbook)  you'll get a good grade. There are 4 tests  but he drops the lowest grade & as I said  as long as you study his notes  you'll ace the tests.

5,I loved this class and I didn't know what sociology was at first. You'll get into it and can speak your mind.
4.5,Great Teacher...loved the class...tests are easy but exams are killerrrr
5,A very subtle and humble man. You can just tell he has so much wisdom and perspective by the way that he approaches life. His class is fun  educational  and even therapeutic in some level
5,"Madison is awesome with a capital ""A"". At first she does appear snobby and she seems intimidating  but she isn't at all. Those are just first impressions. She is just a genius adn knows everything about Edith Wharton & Fitzgerald--it's scary & impressive. Her class is fun  you learn a lot  and she's the most helpful prof I've ever had."
1,No Comments
5,"Madison is very helpful and very clear. This can be witnessed by her following of students who take all of her classe. Class is like a ""book club"" with very informal discussions. She comes across as hard-nosed  though she is not that harsh. She expects quality work  but prepares you thoroughly for all exams. Comes across a bit snobby at times."
4,a very good teacher.. she does sort of appear snobby but u have to get over that false assumption.. she tells you basically the fundamentals of writing an excellent paper
5,i think madison is a good teacher. she tries to make you think that she's hard  but if you take her class you'll find that if you do what you're supposed to  you will make an 'A'! the class is not hard at all.
5,Madison is great. Her lit class is so fun. She can go off on tangents at time about Jay Gatsby but she makes you appreciate the novel even if you don't like it. she respects your opinions if you prove them and is very funny. I'd highly recommend this her
5,Pay no attention to the comments below. The idiots that wrote them obviously can't do the work she assigns and are lazy. Madison is the most outstanding professor I've ever had. She teaches very clear  lets you know what's expected and is awesome.
1,Madison is the most unprofessional instructor I have had in college. She is obviously more worried about people's opinions of her that she is about teaching students. She's not a bad person  but she makes it imposible to respect her.
1,"As far as professionalism is concerned  there is a real lack therof and needs reasessment  don't believe she is worth the time in class and am seriously dissatisfied with the overall turnout. Sorry  but this teacher gets an ""f"". Goodbye."
1,She is so insecure about herself  its sad. Shes immature. She likes to talk down to students to make herself feel good. She has issues.

5,Madison is a great professor! She lets you know what she expects out of you  and plays no games. If you take her you will learn! English isn't so bad anymore after taking her class. Thanks Madison
1,I think that Madison is a very neat teacher.I also think that her teacher style is very original. The most intresting thing that I notice about her style of teaching is when she's making a point. I never get lost because she stays writing on the board.
5,she is very helpful and understanding of your problems. if u need so help on the side she will help u with all that she can.
4.5,madison is alot of fun but she wont pass me in comp one
5,easy to understand and always willing to help
5,very good teacher
5,She is an awesome teacher. She is not easy and makes you work but  she is fair and lets you know what is expected of you at all times. She made a boring subject fun and hopefully i wil be able to take another class from her in the future.
5,Madison is a great teacher. I would recommend her to anyone who was looking for a teacher who made english easy to understand.
5,Super sweet  laid-back professor. Is willing to meet with you outside of class if you missed the material one day and explain anything you don't understand. Also answers emails relatively quickly. He really cares about the students and wants you to succeed in post-grad life.
2,Lectures are very boring/useless. I just read the book. Doesn't know the answers to his own questions. Assigned us a whole project (that was not in the syllabus) 2 days before the first part of it was due. Very vague in what he expects of you and if you ask questions he just rephrases them and makes you feel dumb for asking in the first place.
4,3 Tests  no attendance. Very chill guy and you can tell he really knows what he is talking about. Lectures can be boring. Get the book and study his powerpoints and you can easily can a B or A. Best teacher if you have to take this class.
2.5,He isnt very structured which makes it hard to write notes. There are no powerpoints. a lot of pointless examples? He tries to make jokes that arent funny. I'd prefer someone else. There are example test questions which are very helpful but the in-class questions do not have answers unless you get them when you go to class.
1,Useless professor actually liked marketing until this class. Try and avoid unless you like being bored to death.
3.5,Attendance is not mandatory  but going to class will help for exams. 3 Exams. Read the book & take notes on what he says.
5,He is a really cool guy and will help you out if you need anything. He has five exams but if you miss any you can take the exam on a make up day for any reason. In class its good to go but not mandatory  he gives really good examples. Mainly read the book for the exams and you will do fine!
4.5,HE IS REALLY NICE AND EASY! TAKE HIM IF YOU CAN!
5,He's great!
4,I liked his class because he gives a lot of examples. He doesn't take attendance  but going to class will definetly help you pass the tests! He uses slides & they are available for you to print  very helpful when you study! We had 5 tests so gives you a better chace for a good grade. I didn't think it was boring material  I would take him again!
4.5,Professor was very knowledgeable in the field. Does good reviews for tests. No attendance policy. Just print out slides and study. Pulls questions for the test out of slides. I would definately reccommend. Bad reviews below are for his 5000 level classes.
4.5,i agree with the last two ratings. This teacher is very nice and modest. He gives you all the information needed to pass the class. Powerpoint slides are all you need to pass the class. I have no idea where those other ratings came from  but don't pay attention to them.
4,He makes the class very easy  gives lots of hands on examples. Can get an A on the tests just by studying the lecture notes for 1-2 hours. Very nice guy!
5,One of the nicest professors you'll ever take. He's totally getting an unfair shake by other raters. Extremely knowledgeable and doesn't rely on prepackaged notes (doesn't read the book to you). Higly recommended
1,this guy is can take a simple concept and make it confusing. terrible prof.

1,One of the worst teachers I've ever had... he's belittling  vague and randomly grades assignments.. I learned next to nothing

3,What's the point of paying a guy to tell us what to read in the book and then ask us what was in it? That's not education that's plagiate training.
1,This guy is completely incompetent. Do not take any courses with him.
4,No Comments
3.5,Likes absolute control.
4.5,Wish more teachers were like this one.
4,Really  really funny guy. I was interested in almost all his lectures. Very knowledgable. Lots of homework and quizzes  but they're easy grade boosters. Loved this class.
2.5,Funny guy but his class is boring. He even confuses his self at time but he is very approachable and always willing to go out of his way to help you. He wants everybody to do well in his class which is a genuine quality in a professor
2,boring and doesnt really put effort into his teaching... very unprofessional  falls asleep himself a lot. he's easy  but if you actually are interested and want to learn then you will be dissapointed.
5,professor halfman is a great teacher who has a lot of enthusiasm for the class  works hard for those who actually care about the course  is funny  and the coolest teacher at HWS :-D
3,He's a nice enough guy  but he doesn't seem very smart at all. Very tough grader-takes off different points for different people...boring class. I do not recommend him.
5,One of the better teachers in the school. Very willing to help and can explain things in different ways. Large amount of busy work  but tests are basically given from past tests which he posts. Also very funny and acts like just one of the guys.
2,Great guy but doesnt teach you how to do the homework at all and is a very strict grader. stay away!
5,HE IS AWESOME- i love halfman because he is just a nice guy that will answer any question you have and never make you feel dumb- he is great- take any class of his!

4,he is a really funny person  i think that everyone should take a class with him. he posts everything on blackboard! rocks for jocks cant get easier than this
3,I believe that ball belongs to Mr. Gilmore...
5,Cares about students. Easy class. Yes  but she took it way too seriously. This course is unnecessary for anyone with work experience. The whole ordeal felt overly perky and forced.
5,SHe's a great person... really cares about the students.
5,Really cares about her students  very reasonable person.
5,Really awesome person. Cares alot about every one in class.
5,One of the best people you'll meet at FSU.

5,This is the only class I ever took at 7 a.m. and she made it worth it. She's a good teacher and unbeleivably hot.
5,Most BEAUTIFUL professor ever! I guarantee I miss her more than anyone. Summer is so smart  down to earth  smokin hot  and really funny too. All of her lectures were great but the one on CMC and WBTs were my favorite. I hope I see her again on campus but her modeling career has taken off!!!
5,This was a cool easy class. Summer always tried to make it fun. Sometimes it worked (actually  just looking at her is fun). Great teacher  nice cool beautiful.
5,She is a great teacher. The tests are a little hard but I loved her!
4,Good teacher! Very nice! I enjoyed it alot but if u don't do the reading then u'll fail the mid term and final because she won't teach it to u in class.
4.5,"This class isn't hard at all but Carnet is not one of those TA's who gives everyone an automatic ""A"" on everything either. Do the work=B. Plus xtra credit=A. Overall a good teacher  very understanding and cool and looks like a SI swimsuit model chick (which helps when the class is boring)"
4,Truley an ideal teacher! Really laid-back  funny  and super nice! But be prepared to write cuz thats what the class if based on...just 5 write-ups of your choice out of 10 & a final paper on a book you read. Pretty simple. I definately reccomend him...if you don't mind writing a little.
4.5,Cool prof. She has a lot of energy and is very enthusiastic. Interesting  real layed back  and a fairly easy grader. and let's face it  she is H-O-T.
5,She is the best  super supportive and sweet and will do anything to help you! I highly recommend her!
5,No Comments
4.5,If I can ace a 7AM MWF class  then she's doing something right! (and it take more than her beauty to get me up that early) Just show interest in working on your verbal skills and put a little bit of effort into research and you'll be fine.
5,Awesome. I actually enjoyed going to class. I'll miss her!
5,MY FAVORITE PROF THIS SEMESTER.AND NOT JUST CUZ SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.(BY THE WAY THOUGH-SHE IS.)SHE'S VERY LAIDBACK AND EXTREMELY NICE-REALLY WANTS U TO FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH SPEECHES.GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR.(I WANNA MAKE OUT WITH HER.)
5,great teacher  she makes the class worthwhile. funnny  and easy to relate with. plus really hot!
3.5,She is pretty easy. She cancels class a lot and usually lets you out early. The material is pretty bad  but only because it is so boring. Overall  it was an easy class. Just a lot of busy work.
5,I have her now and she's a GREAT teacher. VERY helpful. Nice and seems to genuinley care about students. :-)
4.5,extremely easy course although she is sooooo boring. She teaches communications yet she has an annoying  monotone voice!
5,She is AWESOME. She is the best teacher for this class. Always willing to help and is very laid back. Take her if you can!!!!
4,"The good: the weekly readings. Topics varied among articles  chapters out of books (good stories)  and interpreting rap cyphers. Keeping the topics engaging is important because like I said  they're weekly. 3 papers  sometimes he'd say he told us something that I didn't recall him saying. ""I told you guys a million times do this and that"" When? Lol"
3,Peter  Peter  Peter. Good class  but thats about it. very straight forward and if you aren't going to do the work don't bother with the class. He expects you to know everything and if you don't its your own fault. He's cool until you do something wrong  then you get slammed for it and spoken down to like your an idiot.
5,I took Peter Conti for both ENG111 and 151. This is a hybrid class  you only meet in class about 6 times for the whole semester. He is a tough grader and expects a lot from his students. He takes no excuses and if you don't do your work don't expect to pass. but he is a great professor overall I really did learn a lot from him.
1,This class was the main stress of the semester I hated it!! He thinks because he knows the subject everyone else does ! He makes you feel so stupid! He doesn't give good instructions! I worked my ass off and stressed more than I should have. Honestly take another professor spare yourself the trouble .
2,Do yourself a favor and take a different Professor. He is anything but encouraging and a tough grader. Make sure you know MLA perfectly and be able to follow his terrible directions perfectly. I was so stressed the whole semester I had him. AVOID!!!!
5,Great professor! Be prepared to do the work but the work is easy if you apply yourself. Deadlines matter but he gives enough time to complete it. Assignments are based on current events so it easily keeps interest!
5,I took him for a hybrid class and at first I honestly thought that I was going to regret it because he seemed tough. After the first few assignments and in class lectures  I was really liking the class and him as a professor. He is a super cool guy. He loves to focus on music and artists that he likes. The topic papers are different and interesting
2,He lives all the way in California and travels to Ny to teach. He is a cool guy but not the best professor. I took his hybrid class because I had no other choice and instantly regret it. It's hard to keep up with his scattered online notifications. He does not give any feedback yet singles students out in the classroom. Doesn't show up to class
5,"Welp  I had this guy for tutor and surprisingly the words ""Never judge a book by its cover"" comes to mind. Although the tattoos and and mean face may deter you from talking to him  he is actually one of the rare individuals who will talk to students as equals and also JOKES around. Took him in Mr Li's  and Peter if you're reading this. HOLD IT  PJ"
3,Really not bad a bad professor. He makes you work for it that's for sure. But he teaches students about controversial topics that are interesting to write about. The papers were cool to write about also. Just make sure to do all the online work  readings and follow the instructions for your papers and you'll do fine
3.5,He's cool and easy  but beware he likes to bash students. He will say your business in front of everyone. Assignments are pretty easy. Make sure you do his online work and your fine. He grades on how much effort you put in. In class work is nothing. He will kick you out if you miss online work sooooo
5,I took his online class  which was not easy. There was a lot of reading and you HAVE to be on top of everything. It is easy to forget to do assignments when you are taking class online. However  Prof. Conti made the work interesting. He is not a piece of cake  but he gives you the grade you deserve!
4.5,Professor Conti is equally impressive as an educator as he is a cool dude. He doesn't BS- BS probably isn't even in his vocabulary. Extremely down to earth but a tough grader. As long as you do literally everything he expects you too you will get at least an A-. He doesn't hand out A's easily but he is a fair grader.
2,Hybrid class  meets only 6 times in physical class. You will have an assignment due every weekend on blackboard. Somewhat of a tough grader  expects a lot from you. not a bad professor though. relates a lot of real world things/music.
5,Great teacher. Not for the faint of heart  he can be abrasively constructive in his criticism. We wrote briefly every class. As long as you put forth effort he was willing to help. Pretty funny guy and his assignments are straight forward no bull. I'm sure he hates me for my Nuclear Fission paper but TOO BAD. I hope he sees I said that too.
5,Pretty easy class  he just wanted you to put effort forth. Had him once a week  hes so awkward and funny  you just wanna hug him.
4.5,he is the best professor i have ever taken beware he is a tough grader and makes you work hard but he is easy to understand he cares for students as long as you care incorporates hip hop into his lessons sometimes which is cool we watched breaking bad in his class he teaches you everything he changed the way i think he changed my life
4,Conti was such an amazing professor because he attacks the real problems of the world and allows us to break those barriers in class. In the 2 hours I had him a weak because I took a hybrid  I learned about current events  how to write  and general knowledge I need to succeed in life. Conti was a life-changing professor.
2.5,He's literally the coach Carter of english....
4,Great teacher really cool loved his class but really not for the sensitive. He's a touch grader but I really enjoyed the class he makes it interesting

5,One of the best professors I ever had. Genuinely cared about the material she taught and wanted to get you to appreciate literature more and become a better writer.
3,Lots of reading  naturally as it is a Brit Lit class. Lots of papers  but most of them don't get graded until the end of semester. Meaning you don't get feedback on your work and what you should fix (from your professor) until its all said and done with. You do get feedback from your peers  this is mandatory. Overall  its a mostly enjoyable class.
4,Great professor. He is ALWAYS willing to help no matter what. He is definitely one of the best English professors that TCC has to offer.
5,Mr. Potter is very good teacher. You do have to study  but he cares. He knows the material and will give you extra help if you want.
5,He is a great and knowledgeable professor. All the bad comments are from students who are just lazy and are trying to get a good grade without putting any effort.
5,He is very smart  very knowledgeable and easy with the homework. And he was generous when it came down to curving test grades.
5,I'm not sure why he has a 3.5 when he deserves a 5.0. He's a wonderful professor and as long as you do the work .
5,You would not waste your time on his class. I wanted to become a better writer. I learned a lot from his class.
5,He is very funny. I would take him again.
5,Best English professor ever  Very thoughtful. An easy A. Take this class if you want become a better writer.
5,I really appreciate him opening the new door for me. I think it was decent amount of homework. I learned a lot from him. It was a little hard to catch up in his class and the assignments at first but his lecture/feedback always makes sense and logical. He spared a lot of his time every time I asked questions. I would take his class again.
1,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Every single review on here is completely accurate. If you do not want this class to be your life  DO NOT TAKE. He is rude  condescending  and you do not learn in his class. His lectures do not pertain to the content. He assigns excess reading that is never covered. He also has very basic  if that  communication skills.
3,Lectures well  but has a tendency to go off on tangents and can come off condescending at times. He takes forever to grade assignments  and grades as if you're a professional. His instructions are fairly clear  but the course is rigorous  and if you don't have time to sit down and plan essays out you'll be lucky to get out with a B.
1,He constantly goes off on tangents that don't connect with the lesson. If you miss one class might as well not show up for the rest of the semester.
2,Grades papers like you are a professional. All of my papers I never got better than a C grade on. He rambles on things that do not have anything to do with the work. I WOULD NOT TAKE HIM AGAIN.
1,If I had known how difficult Potter was beforehand  I wouldn't have taken his class. He took forever to reply to emails  and when he did  he was rude and short with me. He took forever to grade papers  so you basically don't know where you stand in the class all semester. He graded very harshly on papers  and makes you feel stupid.
1,This guy doesn't give any feedback related to the writing process. Although I had my paper proofread by writing labs  he nailed me because he didn't like my MLA format and what I had to say. The MLA was checked by professionals and my views are simply that  my views. Gives incompletes if you don't label exactly how he said regardless writing
3,Online classes have always been tricky  and intro to lit is no exception. I accidentally sighed up for the 8 week class and with 5 other classes--it was brutal. I didn't flunk  but the workload was a lot. He doesn't give encouraging comments  least none that I ever got. So it can sometimes feel like your lost and unsure how to improve your work.
1,Professor Potter was impersonal  was weeks/ months late in grading assignments  and was extremely disorganized. If not for what I knew from high school  I would not have passed this class. Over half of the students dropped out. I learned how to guess my way through unclear assignments and how to use his last-minute feedback in my prepared essays.
5,I'm just okay at literature  but this class really helped me. The prof offered lots of comments on my work and plenty of resources. His lectures were smart and funny.
5,I wanted to become a better writer. This was the class to take. Mr. Potter did not waste my time and his process works.
4.5,Reardon was fantastic! Lectures were super interesting and I learned a lot. If you ask him  he will help you and I even got to skip out on some assignments because I talked to him. Very easy class if you read the books and pay attention.
3.5,Dr. Reardon is a little pompous and particular  but once you understand the writing style he likes  you'll be fine. THIS IS NOT A BLOW OFF CLASS  so don't treat it like one or you will fail...
4.5,Awesome professor. Really helpful and has great sense of humor and pretty cool guy. Not an easy class. Your work ethic will determine your grade so don't blow it off or think it's really easy. It's Not.
4.5,He's really helpful. If there's anything you need help with he's willing to help you. Students come first to him. Great professor. Class isn't a blow off easy class like most think it is. You have to work for the grade you get. Has good humor and is pretty cool guy. Make sure to come prepared to class at all times...just sayin.
4.5,Very helpful! He really understands students and is willing to work with you. One of the best professors I've ever had! Really funny as well!
5,Dr. Reardon is an amazing teacher who is very passionate about his work and the success of his students. Strongly encouraged classroom participation. Get your work done on time  he doesn't allow late credit.
4.5,Best prof I've had. Genuinely entertaining. Keeps the class engaged. Expands on the subject. Grades all essays in front of you. You have input and can easily understand what is wrong with your paper. Unlimited rewrites secures an easy A.
5,Best Teacher Ever! He's hilarious in class and really has a passion for teaching. He's completely willing to help you with any problems/questions you may have. I would highly recommend taking any and all of his classes.
2.5,very rude to some of the students in class  has favorites  text is boring and sometimes hard to comprehend  quizes are over minor details in the text
4.5,Very funny and easy teacher. Was willing to work with you on problems. Quizzes are easy even if you don't read the book beforehand. Doesn't restrict project ideas (He let a guy make an add for a wife remote and lots about guns and explosives). Very helpful and knows what he is talking about.
4,Pretty good teacher. He is however very biased towards the subject of any essay you'll ever write. Example: Write an essay about football and you're pretty much guaranteed an A+
5,English 65 / TechCom 65. Great professor. Very effictive teaching style. Easy easy class as long as you go everyday and do the inclass work and the few (easy) projects.
1,I don't understand why everyone thinks he's easy and funny. A lot of times we just sat and watched movies  and he gives out quiz questions abstract from the plot of the readings. I talked to him about my falling grade  he told me he didn't care  without giving me any suggestions.
1,I heard that he was a good teacher so I decided to take his class for a fun summer course. Bad mistake unless you are really good at trivial persuit. Tests are rediculously hard. And is very bias when it comes to your grade and if he likes you.
5,Reardon is one of the few engish teachers I have had that allowed for insiteful discussions instead of plenty of BS. The literature he has his students read is very eye-opening and worth reading. If at all possible  be sure to signup as one of his students.
3,Not recommended if you don't want to work very ver hard. Though he's a good teacher  he asks far too much for a lower level class. It's not supposed to be as difficult as it was. There are no reviews for tests and the tests are very very hard. He does curve them  but you shouldn't have to in a class like this. He is fun and does enjoy what he does.
4.5,Nothing to fear in this class
4.5,I expected this class to suck  and for me to suck at it. But I was proved wrong on both.
5,Great teacher. Hated english till i took this class. Very considerate teacher. Doesn't mind if your cell phone goes off like other teachers. He is very understanding. Funny and entertaining also.
5,Funny man. Tought me a lot. Good guy. Easy to talk to and work with.
5,Prof. Sierra is an interesting man
1.5,I wanted to take Foster but ended up taking Sierra. He is VERY rude. He talks SO fast during his lectures making it difficult to keep up & write down everything u need. He asks the stupidest smallest details about a movie or person on the test. He criticizes this generation so much & talks to u like ur an idiot. show up & don't dare use ur phone!
5,I had this professor years ago for English 49B and one of the theater arts film classes. He was the best! His film noir class was so much fun  and I still remember it fondly almost ten years later because now I'm a huge TCM classic film fan. His classes were easy As and he allowed us to do revisions on papers.
5,An amazing professor. Unfortunately I did not take his Theater Arts 7A class  but 7B was an amazing class. As we all know professor Sierra said that he is not going to teach anymore  however it was great pleasure to be in his class. Hated when some mentally challenged students used their phones for texting  was crystal clear and very funny)))))
4,He is a hilarious and pretty sarcastic (in a funny way) professor. Very knowledgeable thus  this has made my lesson very interesting. You are allowed to bring your laptops for notes during the exams  lectures are important  and one Research paper. No code required for textbook. Gets annoyed by people who uses their cellphone in during the movies.
4,Prof. Sierra is a nice  outgoing professor who expects good papers from students! 3 4-6paged essays w clear instructions  be sure to do ANALYTICAL instead of reiterating plot. INTRO paragraph  THESIS paragraph  BODY paragraphs  and CONCLUSION paragraph. Quizzes are okay! Two books he assigned can be found online PDF for free. Good luck:)
5,I've taken both of his film classes and he really knows about the genres and films he is talking about. ALSO  if you plan on not coming to class and have no interest in film don't take this class. Why would you not want to come to a class where you watch just watch films? The essays are not even hard because he lays out the parts that he expects..
3.5,He gives a lecture every class  and you watch a movie after that. You need to attend class (even if you have seen the movie) in order to take notes (he tells you what you need to know for the exams). 2 exams  and one research project. Easy class  he is sarcastic and funny. You need to read the book.
4.5,Midterm  Final  & Paper. Paper is extremely easy  emphasize the extremely. Midterm & final are both open notebook & book. Come to class & write down EVERYTHING he says. Highlightunderline the ones that he says will be on the test. Print out the class lecture notes instead of copying it from the screen. Stay for the movies  q's will be on tests!
5,Fantastic class. You watch so many great films  and he gives great in depth back story to each. 5 quizzes  which are super easy  and 3 papers which are very manageable. Easy  and a very awesome guy  great sense of humor.
3.5,Super easy. show up to class. take some notes. stay for the films. only 2 tests (midterm and final) both are open note and open book. and one extremely easy paper. no reason for anyone to get lower than a B. He's a no BS kind of guy. He knows what he is talking about.
3.5,I've taken three film classes with Sierra because not only is he awesomely cynical but you have to be a complete idiot to get anything lower than an A. He makes all of his papers and quiz material extremely clear to follow. This class is even enjoyable for non-film majors.
4.5,Professor Sierra's class could not be any easier. I definitely liked the fact that there was no homework compared to the other TA teacher. Go to class  stay for the movies  jot down the notes  and review before the test. THERE IS NO REASON YOU SHOULD NOT GET AN A IN THIS CLASS!
5,One of the coolest professor. He always make jokes and share personal experience to entertain and at the same time he has a extremely detailed note coverage makes along with online proof reading. Tests are 100% from the notes/book/online reading. If you have all 3 of these prepared  this class would be extremely entertaining and easy.
4.5,Ridiculously easy class. He tells you what will be on the test as he lectures. He can be really condescending at times by talking to the class like they're 5-year-olds  but I guess he is just frustrated that a lot of people somehow manage to fail this class.
5,You will LOVE this teacher! Very funny  and you can tell he really know his stuff. His lectures are very easy and fun to listen to. Many time he will hint out the mid term/ final answers during the lectures  so prepare! Your grade will be based of a mid term  essay  and a final. The tests are open notes/book  so don't sweat! Easy A  take him.
5,This professor is amazing! He was incredibly funny  really had a love for film  and knew all there was to know about it. Highly recommend taking this class over fosters if you love film. The plus side is you don't have to buy fosters book new also! Just sit back  take some notes  and watch some great films.
5,Loved this class! All you need to do is attend class/watch the movies he assigns and take notes. He tells you everything that will be on the tests. Great professor  very funny  and very knowledgable.
4,The 7A class may be a bit more detailed. Note down what he tells you to note down  or everything and buy the book. Don't be lazy on this one. Get the A. 2 tests  one easy paper. Open note/book although sometimes hard to find answers
5,He can come off as condescending sometimes  don't take it personal cause it's not. He's funny  direct  and engages you into the subject and history behind the movies and makers. His tests are usually open notes. Just read them at least once so you're not looking through all of it during the exam. Took Foster too  I say Sierra is better.
4.5,Her exams were so easy...if you pay attention and study the review sheets she gives you for every chapter  you are set. She is very informative and as a prior poster recommended  don't be fooled by her hard demeanor early on. She will tell you that she is not your friend and expects to be respected as a professor. If you have valid reasons for m
4.5,I love this woman! She is so cute!I was very surprised. Don't be fooled on the first day when she acts tough and says that she is not your friend... she is one of the sweetest  funniest teachers that I have ever had. She makes class very interesting and tells hilarious stories about her personal experiences.
5,Extremely nice  extremely smart  has an accent but its not too bad  I probly would of done things to this lady like 5 years ago shes kinda hot. Test and quizzes are easy  one presentation to the class with a group. EASY I RECOMMEND IT
5,Really nice and helpful
5,All I have 2 say is se---xxxxx-----yyyyyyy!!!
4,great teacher lots of help knows what she is talking about and doesnt stop till you do
5,She's so adorable !! So nice and the class is easy .
4.5,Take this class!!
5,Shy and earnest. Fluent in english  but less so in written material. She likes classroom discussions  but don't talk out of turn. She really cares about her students understanding the material and is always willing to help. One of my favorite profs.
3,The online class was very disorganized  which made the class very hard. I had to email him a lot with questions and clarifications because of this. He's usually pretty good about answering emails and is very willing to help you understand and do well. Class is based around reading lectures  exams  paper- actually do the work and you'll be fine.
1,The second rating below me is probably Dr. Sumner rating himself. This professor will not answer emails  he lags behind in all of his responsibilities as the department chair. I suggest he be demoted back to assistant professor  and let one of the more qualified professors take his spot.
2,This professor does not care to help when you reach out to them for help. The tests are timed and are very difficult. I completed all my course work and I don't feel like I deserved a D. He is super tough grader when you need help or you have question about the assignment he does not answer in a good time frame. I still have not received a response
5,Communication skills are A1! He'll get back to you within minutes. wrote a 40 pg paper for his summer class on top of all of the work. 4 week course- LOTS of work but nothing too hard to understand.
2.5,I took his Psychology 203 class. He is really not such a great teacher. He is fun the class is somewhat enjoyable but he is completely unreasonable. He is absent a lot and is a terrible grader. It took me a little while to understand his system and what would be on the tests. If you dont mind teaching yourself then the class isn't that bad.
3.5,I took the online summer option for this class. Be prepared to work hard listen to lectures and read the textbook. But if you do that you will pass. His test are fair. If you are self motivated then this is a good class for you.
2.5,I did not do well with this class at all. It was a 3 week course and it was way too much to handle. Familiarize yourself with the material  but make sure you don't memorize it like I did. The tests were multiple choice but confusing as well as it was the biggest percentage of your grade 60% and only 3 tests. I will never take him again
1,The worst experience I have ever encountered with a professor. He NEVER answered my emails  or questions. He waited until the last possible minute to upload or grade anything  meanwhile his folders were stocked with files that dated back to 2012. Most unorganized class ever  and so unhelpful.
2,Honestly  one of the laziest professors I have ever encountered. Took him for an online course and not only was he awful in replying back  his folders are so clustered that material from 2012 is still uploaded. A final project (worth 100 points) due on the last day of the course was uploaded by him the day before. Would NEVER take him again!!!
1,He is by far the worst teacher Ive ever had in my life. He doesnt care if you fail or do well. He was supposed to help me with doing a program with my internship and rarely answered any of my emails when I asked him what to do. I messaged him at least four times a month for the entire summer and he answered 3 times.
1,Dr. Sumner is the most worthless professor I've ever had. He never replies to emails  just gossips during class and doesn't help when requested. I honestly don't know how he's been teaching as long as he has.
1.5,Horrible professor  took his class online. He never replies in 5 weeks i sent 4 emails he replied to 1 with a rhetorical question of one line i don't understand the material and he does not care.
1,Dr. Sumner was absent throughout his online class. I believe he might be the only professor that teaches the required qualitative statistical method course needed to gain a Psych degree. I will look to take elsewhere and transfer in credit. I will never take a course w him again. He wasted my $. I learned nothing.
1,I took an online class with this professor. He does not return emails or answer questions that student post on the discussion post. If you ask him a direct question  he will not answer it  instead he will get nasty with you. His instructions are not clear. He does not enjoy teaching or care for his students. will ruin your GPA  do NOT take him RUN!
1,Took an online class with this professor. Tried my hardest and received a C. Does not communicate well.
1,Took his online course.If you plan on taking other classes and/or having a life DO NOT take this class. He is unclear  unhelpful and a bit nasty. When I emailed him to clarify things for me  he always came back with an email that was one line and made me feel like a complete idiot. Ixe2x80x99m not a disgruntled student xe2x80x93 his class was just that awful.
1,He's such a horrible  lackadaisical professor! Avoid at all costs
2,online and it tanked my gpa did everything the way I was asked  4/5 assignments to be done by end of semester  I tried hard and got a C (first one) the material was interesting i still have no clue y grade was so low.
5,Dr. Sumner is a great teacher. I have an aversion and mental disability to math
3,Easy A! his lecture could be boring at times and he could be really funny. He gives you the questions to the midterm and final and he will even help you with them if you are having trouble.. dont kid yourself if hes giving you them ahead of time they are not going to be easy but just go for xtra help n ull do fine..other assignments wer super easy
3,Prof Richardson teaches this Global Health class from his personal perspective of opening a health clinic in Africa. He has a lot of experience and makes it super cool to listen to. You will know more about neglected diseases than you ever wanted to but you'll love it! He really cares about the students and wants you to do well. Hard but worth it.
2,Dr. Richardson is one of the worst lab teachers you can imagine. He is extremely unclear with what he wants for lab reports  texts  and quizzes. I emailed him several times and never got responses. Highly recommend to avoid him at all costs.
5,He is so passionate about parasites and makes you get excited about them too. It's a lot of memorization and on the tougher side but I would take this class again hands down! He is really reasonable with his students and with his work load. Seriously a very interesting class with a really funny and passionate professor. Highly recommend him!
4.5,Dr. Richardson is easily my favorite professor at Quinnipiac. He has more compassion for his students than anyone I know and it was a pleasure to continually have him as a professor. If you put in the work  you will pass no problem - but if you have a heavy course load  I do not suggest taking him. Wonderful  caring  brilliant! Love him dearly!
4,Very passionate professor and very accomplished. He expects the best out of students but beware of his extra times in labs counting fecal pellets. He is very clear when he lectures but please please pleasee record him or write everything he says. Time consuming course but very rewarding. I really look up to him and respect the man.
4,Richardson is my favorite professor at Quinnipiac. I would take this class again if I could. It was tough and a lot of memorization  but I have never felt as accomplished as I did after his exams. He is such an amazing person and so inspiring. This class is a must take for biology majors
4.5,Definitely a course on the tougher side but I would take it again without thinking twice. The information is extremely interesting & his passion for it makes it so much better. You definitely need to set aside an hour a day to look over the information from the class before then you'll be golden. He is an amazing person and teacher don't miss out!
5,He was an amazing professor. I learned a lot. Expect pop quizzes every week and a lot of memorization. Take this class you won't regret it
1.5,Great sense of humor!!!! Love parasites now!!!!!
2.5,he is a really nice guy and is really funny..however for bio 102 he hasnt been the best teacher..usually posts important lectures online without explaining them and goes into a lot of depth on lectures that aren't that important..shows boring videos youre not tested on (pointless) and wastes class time..doesn't have his priorities straight.nice guy
5,His parasitology class is a lot of work but he makes it extremely interesting. Offers EC. Really nice guy and very passionate!
4,He is WAY too much work for a 1 credit class. Shegnoski was nice  helpful  and much easier.
5,Extremely easy lab teacher  quizzes are a little difficult though. Hes always there to help you and he is also very entertaining and loves his profession  which is hard to find  so the labs aren't bad  i would take him again.
